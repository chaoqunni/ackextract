The 58 main source of infection is pneumonia patients infected by new coronavirus. Respiratory droplets 59</p><p>are the main route of transmission and it can also be transmitted through contact. People are 60 generally susceptible. At present, the occurrence, development, mechanism of prognosis and 61 immune status of patients with 2019-nCoV are still unclear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> This study intends to detect the 62 peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 123 patients with 2019-nCoV infection by 63 using four-color immunoflow cytometry and multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence to 64 investigate the cellular immunity status and cytokine levels of 2019-nCoV infected patients, to 65 explore the correlation between cellular immune statuses, cytokine levels and the severity of 2019-66 nCoV infection. 67</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods 68</head><p>Patients 69 were diagnosed according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for NCP and divided 73 into mild and severe (including severe and critical) groups 74</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation between lymphocyte subsets and IL-6 in NCP patients 147</head><p>Considering that the value of IL-6 changed most in the mild and severe groups, the correlation 148 between the lymphocyte subsets and the cytokine IL-6 was analyzed. The data with IL-6 value of 0 149 in each group (57 cases in light group and 3 cases in severe group) were excluded, and 45 cases in 150 the mild group and 18 cases in severe group were included in the correlation analysis. As shown in 151 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, the correlation analysis between IL-6 and lymphocyte subsets showed that the Pearson 152 correlation coefficients of IL-6 and CD4 + T, CD8 + T, B cell, NK cell, CD4 + T / CD8 + T were 153 very low, and there was no significant linear correlation. 154</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood between patients with mild 155</head><p>and severe NCP 156</p><p>The data (57 cases of IL-6 and 3 cases of IFN in the mild group) with the index value of 0 in 157 the two groups were excluded. Two independent-samples t test was performed on the lymphocyte 158 subsets and cytokines of the mild group and the severe group, with α= 0.05 as the inspection level. 159</p><p>Significant differences were observed in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 between the mild group 160 and the severe group (P &lt; 0.05), while no significant difference was detected in B cell, NK cell, 161 CD4 + T / CD8 + T, IL-4, IL-17, TNF, IFN between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05, <ref type="table">Table 4)</ref>. 162</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion 163</head><p>Lymphocyte subsets play an important role in the body's cellular immune regulation, and each 164 cell restricts and regulates each other. This study found that among NCP patients, the reduction rate 165 of CD4 + T accounted for 52.90% in the mild group, and 95.24% in the severe group; the reduction 166 rate of CD8 + T accounted for 28.40% in the mild group, and 61.90% in the severe group, indicating 167 that T lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients when the body is resistant to 2019-nCoV 168 infection. This was consistent with the research conclusions of Huabiao Chen 2 in SARS coronavirus, 169 revealing that the body responds in the same way when coping with homologous coronavirus 170 infection. The reduction ratio of B cell was 25.49% and 28.57% in the mild group and the severe 171 group, respectively, with no significant difference. The reduction ratio of NK cells accounted for 172 34.31% in the mild group and 47.62% in the severe group, which suggested that 2019-nCoV 173 infection limited the activity of NK cells to a certain extent, and in view of the fact that immune 174 adjuvant IL-2 can improve the activity of NK cells, the above research results may provide new 175 .

The results of this study indicated 180 that 21 patients in the severe group had IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF within normal values. TNF and 181 IFN mainly secreted by Th1 cells and NK cells were not significantly different between the mild 182 and severe groups. In the mild group, 55.88% of the patients had IL-6 detection value of 0, and 183 30.39% of the patients had IL-6 detection value higher than the normal value. The reason remains 184 to be elucidated, which may be related to the inhibition of Th2 cells involved in humoral immunity 185 in the early stage of infection. However, the proportion of IL-6 above normal was 76.19% in the 186 severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group. This is in line with the 187 concept of "Cytokine Storm", which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become  This study has several limitations. Firstly, as the largest diagnosis and treatment center for 207 patients with NCP in Chongqing area, our hospital has more than 123 patients so far. The sample 208 size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some 209 impact on the statistical results. But on the whole, the number of patients in this area was in the 210 middle level for other parts of the country except Wuhan, and the research results were relatively 211 reliable. Secondly, the humoral immunity level of the included patients was not monitored, so there 212 was a certain deficiency in the evaluation of the immune system. Thirdly, due to the large-scale 213 outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank 214</p></div>

The corresponding quantities and proportions were counted (Table 2). 137 Among the mild patients, 102 (100%) patients had IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 all within normal 138 values; 57 (55.88%) patients had IL-6 values of 0 and 14 (13.73%) within normal values, 31 139 (30.39%) were higher than normal; 100 (98.04%) patients had TFN values within normal values, 2 140 (1.96%) were higher than normal values; 92 (90.20%) patients had IFN within the normal values, 5 141 cases (4.90%) had IFN values of 0, and 5 cases (4.90%) were higher than normal values. 142 In severe patients, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF were all within the normal values in 21 (100%) 143 patients; IL-6 was 0 in 3 patients (14.29%), 2 patients (9.52%) were within the normal values, 16 144 patients (76.19%) were higher than the normal values; IFN was within the normal values in 20 145</figDesc></figure>

In 189 addition, in the course of diagnosis and treatment, the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital 190 noticed that monitoring the changes of cytokines during the treatment process is of certain 191 significance to optimize the treatment plan and predict the outcome of the disease. 192 The results of this study suggested that there was no significant linear correlation between 193 lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. By analyzing the differences of lymphocyte subsets and 194 cytokines in peripheral blood between the mild and severe patients, we found that only CD4 + T, 195 CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 had statistical significance between the mild and severe groups, suggesting 196 that the immunosuppression of severe patients with 2019-nCoV infection was more obvious, which 197 was consistent with the opinions of many experts. 5, 6 For several results of this study, for example, 198 the proportion of patients with an IL-6 value of 0 in the mild group was as high as 55.88%, there 199 was no significant difference in terms of IL-17, TNF, IFN, and IL-4 between the two groups of 200 patients, both B cell and NK cell decreased in different degrees in two groups of patients, the 201 possible reasons are as follows. (1)The conclusion of this study is a true reflection of the 202 characteristics of 2019-nCoV itself; (2) In the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection, due to the strong 203 variability and good concealment of the virus, it cannot be quickly recognized by the body; (3) 204 2019-nCoV releases certain special factors after entering the body and interferes with the body's 205 .
