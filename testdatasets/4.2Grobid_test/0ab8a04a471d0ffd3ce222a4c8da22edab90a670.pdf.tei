However, there currently is no BCV vaccine licensed in the United States to aid in the prevention of BRD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">8</ref> Despite the fact that BCV has been associated with respiratory tract infections in cattle of all ages, its role in the pathogenesis of BRD in cattle at various production stages remains unclear. Most research on the association between BCV and BRD has involved feedlot cattle. Shedding of BCV in the absence of other important respiratory tract pathogens has been observed in cattle with naturally occurring BRD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">15</ref> and BCV has been isolated from pneumonic lungs alone or in combination with other respiratory tract pathogens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref> Results of multiple studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref> indicate that cattle with high anti-BCV antibody titers at feedlot entry are less likely to shed BCV and develop BRD than are cattle with low anti-BCV antibody titers at feedlot entry. However, it is not uncommon for apparently healthy feedlot cattle to shed BCV, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">24</ref> which raises questions about the respective associations of anti-BCV antibody titer and BCV shedding with the risk of BRD in feedlot cattle.</p><p>Compared with the information known about feedlot cattle, much less is known about the relationship between BCV and BRD in preweaned beef calves. Dairy calves, even those with fairly high passively (colostrum) or actively (vaccination) acquired anti-BCV antibody titers, can shed BCV during the first week after birth, and recurrent shedding of BCV by apparently healthy dairy calves is common, which suggests that many BCV infections are not associated with disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">26</ref> To our knowledge, a comprehensive study to evaluate BCV shedding and anti-BCV antibody titers in preweaned beef calves (a population for which the risk of BRD differs substantially among both individual animals and herds over time) has not been conducted. Thus, the literature is lacking with regard to a temporal evaluation of BCV shedding, humoral immunity to BCV, and the risk for development of BRD throughout the entire production cycle of beef cattle. The purpose of the study reported here was to evaluate the effect of serum anti-BCV antibody abundance on BCV shedding patterns and the incidence of BRD in beef calves from birth through the first 5 weeks in a feedlot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animals</head><p>Eight hundred ninety natural-service crossbred beef calves born during April and May 2014 were monitored from birth to the end of their fifth week in a feedlot. All study calves originated from 4 herds that were managed in separate locations at the USMARC. Each of those 4 herds contained additional calves that were not enrolled in the study. Herds 1 and 2 consisted of calves that were born as a result of artificial insemination or natural service, whereas herds 3 and 4 consisted of calves that were born as a result of natural service only. Only natural-service calves were enrolled in the study because calves that were born as a result of artificial insemination were enrolled in another study. All calves were managed in the same manner regardless of whether they were enrolled in the study reported here. The 4 herds did not have fence-line contact, so there was no direct pathogen transmission among herds. All experimental protocols were approved by the USMARC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval Nos. 5438-31000-082-04 and 3040-32000-031-07).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vaccination schedule and calf processing</head><p>The cows (dams) in all 4 herds received an MLV vaccine-bacterin combination product a that contained antigens of BHV1, BVDV1, BVDV2, PI3, BRSV, and bacterins for Campylobacter fetus and 5 serovars of Leptospira spp prior to breeding (approx June) annually. The dams were also vaccinated against enteric pathogens approximately 30 days before the beginning of calving season. That vaccine b contained killed strains of bovine rotavirus and BCV, a K99 Escherichia coli bacterin, and Clostridium perfringens type C toxoid to enhance the production and secretion of antibodies against those pathogens into the colostrum and aid in the prevention of diarrhea in calves.</p><p>Calves at approximately 20 to 70 days of age (June [same time as dams received prebreeding vaccine]) received an initial vaccination with an MLV vaccinebacterin combination product c that contained antigens of BHV1, BVDV1, BVDV2, PI3, BRSV, and M haemolytica and a multivalent bacterin-toxoid product d intended to protect animals against disease caused by Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium sordellii, C perfringens types C and D, and Moraxella bovis. Calves at 111 to 161 days of age (approx 21 days prior to weaning <ref type="bibr">[ie, preconditioning]</ref>) received a booster of the respiratory vaccine c and another multivalent clostridial vaccine e intended to protect animals against disease caused by C chauvoei, C septicum, Clostridium haemolyticum, C novyi, C sordellii, and C perfringens types C and D. Calves at approximately 130 to 190 days of age (weaning and feedlot entry) received another respiratory vaccine f that contained antigens of BHV1, BVDV1, BVDV2, PI3, and BRSV.</p><p>Calves were weaned between September 24 and October 3, 2014, and moved from their herds of origin to a feedlot where they were processed and commingled in 14 pens, each of which had capacity for approximately 70 calves. Calves were allocated to pens such that each pen contained the same pro-portion of calves from each of the 4 herds of origin. That method of allocation was chosen to maximize exposure among calves from all 4 herds and simulate the commingling of calves that occurs at commercial feedlots.</p><p>Over the next 5 weeks, calves with suspected BRD were removed from each pen for sample collection and treated in accordance with the standard operating procedure established for cattle maintained at the USMARC. Diagnosis of BRD was made on the basis of the presence of clinical signs such as lethargy, anorexia, abnormal breathing, nasal and ocular discharge, and pyrexia. Calves were treated at the discretion of feedlot staff and the attending veterinarian, all of whom remained unaware of (were blinded to) the herd of origin for each calf at the time of BRD diagnosis. All adverse health events and treatments were recorded for each study calf so that associations between BRD and other comorbidities could be evaluated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample collection procedures</head><p>A blood sample (approx 9 mL) for plasma acquisition was collected between 18 and 48 hours after birth from a small subset (n = 34) of calves for which both birth and the first nursing episode were observed. A blood sample (approx 9 mL at initial vaccination and 25 mL at preconditioning and weaning) for serum acquisition and nasal swab specimens were collected from all 890 calves at the time of each vaccination (initial vaccination, preconditioning, and weaning). Those 3 sample acquisition times were selected to eliminate additional stress associated with excessive handling because calves were already being handled at those times for routine processing and vaccination.</p><p>Additional blood samples (approx 9 mL) and nasal swab specimens were obtained from each calf removed from a pen because of suspected BRD (cases; n = 67) as well as apparently healthy calves (controls; 109). Two controls were selected for sample collection from each pen on a weekly basis during the first 4 weeks after feedlot entry. Because of a low number of cases in the fifth week, controls were selected only from the pens with cases. Controls were selected by use of a convenience method, rather than a randomized sampling method, to prevent or minimize stress associated with sorting needed to remove specific calves. Notches were made in the ear tags of calves treated for BRD as well as control calves to prevent those calves from being selected as controls at future sampling dates.</p><p>Blood samples were obtained by jugular venipuncture with an 18-gauge needle at 18 to 48 hours after birth and initial vaccination and with a 16-gauge needle at all sample acquisition times thereafter. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1,650 X g at 4°C for 25 minutes. Then, the plasma or serum from each sample was harvested and stored at -80°C until analysis.</p><p>Nasal swab specimens were obtained by passing 2 sterile 6-inch-long cotton-tipped swabs into each nostril to swab the nasopharyngeal region. For each calf during each sample acquisition time, 1 nasal swab specimen from each nostril was obtained and placed into a cryovial that contained 1 mL of transport medium (buffered peptone water with 12% glycerol). Vials were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of viral pathogens by use of RT-PCR assay</head><p>Real-time PCR methods were used to detect respiratory viruses (BHV1, BVDV, BCV, and BRSV) in nasal swab medium that was used for transport and storage of nasal swab specimens. Viral shedding was determined for 60 calves that were randomly selected by means of a random number generator from each of the 4 herds at each of the 3 routine sample acquisition times (initial vaccination, preconditioning, and weaning). That sample size was selected because it was calculated to have a 95% probability for detection of at least 1 infected animal if the true prevalence of viral shedding in the herd at the sample acquisition time was at least 5%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">27</ref> Viral shedding was also determined for cases and controls on the basis of disease status and sample collection date. Briefly, pools consisting of nasal swab medium from 5 calves were created on the basis of herd of origin at each routine sample acquisition time as well as on the basis of disease status (case or control) and sample collection date.</p><p>Each pool contained 100 µL of nasal swab medium from each of the 5 designated calves. From each pooled sample, RNA was extracted by use of a phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent, g and DNA was extracted with a silica membrane-based nucleic acid purification kit. h Then, an RT-PCR assay was performed to detect the major viral pathogens associated with BRD (BHV1, BRSV, BVDV, and BCV). Primers and probes used for the assay were the same as those described in other studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[31]</ref> For each sample analyzed, cyclic amplification was conducted on a 25-µL reaction solution containing 2.5 µL each of extracted RNA and DNA, 4.5mM magnesium chloride, 400µM of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 0.4µM concentration of each primer, 0.2µM concentration of each probe, and 1 µL of an enzyme mix i with reverse transcriptase and a hot-start Taq polymerase. Cycling conditions included reverse transcription at 50°C for 30 minutes, inactivation of the reverse transcriptase enzyme and activation of the Taq polymerase at 95°C for 15 minutes, and 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 60 seconds, and 72°C for 60 seconds. Positive, negative, no-template, and extraction control samples were included in each assay. Samples with a Ct value &lt; 40 were considered to have positive results for the virus of interest. For pooled samples that yielded positive results for a particular virus, the RT-PCR assay was repeated on individual nasal swab medium from each of the 5 calves that contributed to the pooled sample to identify the calf or calves that were shedding the virus of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of bacterial pathogens by RT-PCR assay</head><p>Samples of nasal swab medium collected from cases (calves with BRD) and controls during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry were sent to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Veterinary Diagnostic Center for detection of M haemolytica, P multocida, H somni, and M bovis by use of multiplex RT-PCR methods that have been validated for nasal swab specimens and lung tissue matrices obtained from cattle. j This RT-PCR assay was performed on individual samples (ie, samples were not pooled).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of anti-BCV antibodies</head><p>For each of the 240 calves evaluated for BCV shedding at initial vaccination and weaning, serum anti-BCV antibody abundance was measured by use of a commercially available indirect antibody ELISA k in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Serum anti-BCV antibody abundance was also measured in samples collected at initial vaccination and weaning for the 67 cases and 109 controls evaluated during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry and in samples collected from birth through weaning for a small subset of calves from herds 3 (n = 21) and 2 (13) that did and did not, respectively, have evidence of BCV infection in preweaned calves. Briefly, test plates were assessed at a wavelength of 450 nm with a computer-linked ELISA plate reader. l Optical density of the tested sample was divided by the optical density of the positive control sample provided in the kit to calculate the anti-BCV antibody percentage positivity for the tested sample. Samples with a percentage positivity &lt; 10 were considered negative for anti-BCV antibodies (seronegative), whereas those with a percentage positivity ≥ 10 were considered positive for anti-BCV antibodies (seropositive). A percentage positivity &gt; 100 could be obtained if the concentration of anti-BCV antibodies in the tested sample was greater than that in the positive control sample provided in the kit. A dilution series for the positive control sample was used to determine the assay limit of linearity because the linear range for measurement of anti-BCV antibodies was not provided by the manufacturer. Results indicated that the percentage positivity of the positive control sample had a good linear range from 10 to 100. When measured values were compared with expected values, the linearity equation was Y = 1.657X -0.08916, with R 2 = 0.999. All test samples with results greater than that linear range were diluted and retested. The adjusted percentage positivity was calculated as the dilution factor of the sample multiplied by the percentage positivity, and that value was accepted as the relative anti-BCV antibody abundance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Individual calves were the experimental unit for all analyses. Two-way contingency tables m were created, and χ 2 tests were used to assess the respective associations between the development of BRD during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry (case or control status) and BCV shedding and the presence of specific bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx. The respective associations between serum anti-BCV antibody ELISA results and herd of origin or case status were evaluated by use of a 1-way ANOVA followed by t tests for pairwise comparisons only if the overall F test was significant. Separate linear regression models were developed for the dependent variables of weaning age and weaning weight. Both models included fixed effects for herd of origin, case status, and the interaction between herd of origin and case status. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the effect of herd on case status. All ANOVA and regression analyses were performed with a commercially available statistical software program. n Values of P &lt; 0.05 were considered significant for all analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calves</head><p>The number of calves enrolled in the study from each herd, median dam parity within each herd, and mean ± SD weaning age and weight for the study calves were summarized <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. Although cows in all 4 herds were exposed to bulls during the same 60-day period, the time during that period at which the study calves were conceived differed among herds. Thus, the mean weaning age and weaning weight of study calves differed among herds. Of the 890 calves enrolled in the study, 4 were excluded prior to weaning because of injury or death, although none of the conditions were known to be related to infectious disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respiratory virus shedding and BRD incidence prior to feedlot entry</head><p>Shedding of each of 4 respiratory viruses (BHV1, BVDV, BRSV, and BCV) in 60 randomly selected study calves from each herd was determined at initial vaccination (20 to 70 days old), preconditioning (111 to 161 days old), and weaning (130 to 190 days old). Bovine viral diarrhea virus was not detected in any calf at any sample acquisition time prior to feedlot entry. Bovine herpesvirus-1 was detected in 2 calves of herd 4 at weaning; BRSV was also detected in 1 of those calves. The number of calves from which BCV was detected in nasal swab specimens was summarized (Table 2). Bovine coronavirus was detected in 14 (23%) calves of herd 3 at initial vaccination and 8 (13%) and 9 (15%) calves of herds 1 and 3, respectively, at weaning. The overall prevalence rate of BCV shedding was 6% (14/240) at initial vaccination, 0% at preconditioning, and 7% (17/240) at weaning, and the overall prevalence rate of BCV shedding prior to feedlot entry was 4% (8/180) for herd 1, 0% for herd 2, 13% (23/180) for herd 3, and 0% for herd 4. The incidence of BRD (defined as the presence of lethargy, anorexia, abnormal breathing, nasal and ocular discharge, and pyrexia) in calves prior to feedlot entry differed among the 4 herds and ranged from 0% (herds 2 and 4) to 11% (herd 3). The incidence rate of BRD in calves prior to feedlot entry for herd 3 (25/226 [11%]) was significantly greater than that for herd 1 (2/138 [1.5%]). None of the 27 calves that developed BRD prior to feedlot entry had comorbidities such as diarrhea, and only 3 calves were treated for diarrhea prior to feedlot entry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respiratory virus shedding and BRD incidence during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry</head><p>Of the calves enrolled in the study, 70 (7.9%) developed BRD during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry (cases). The incidence rate of BRD in calves during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry differed among the 4 herds of origin. Of the 70 cases, 39 (55.7%) were steers and 31 (44.3%) were heifers. The cases were distributed fairly equally among the 14 pens, with at least 1 BRD case identified in 11 pens during the first week after feedlot entry <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Supplementary Table S1</ref>, available at avmajournals.avma.org/doi/suppl/10.2460/ajvr.78.9.1065).

Thus, the majority (10/12) of controls that had positive results for BCV during that period originated from herd 2. In contrast, BCV was detected in 24 of 26 (92%) cases during weeks 3, 4, and 5, and those BCV-positive cases originated from all herds, except herd 1.

However, given that BCV was detected in all 41 cases and 52 controls evaluated during the first 2 weeks after feedlot entry, weeks 3 through 5 after feedlot entry were analyzed separate from weeks 1 and 2 after feedlot entry.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Although there is mounting evidence that BCV is involved in the etiology of BRD, information regarding the respective temporal relationships between humoral immunity against BCV and BCV shedding and the risk for the development of BRD in beef calves at various times before and after feedlot entry is lacking. Results of the present study indicated that serum anti-BCV antibody abundance was not associated with BCV shedding; however, BCV shedding was positively associated with the incidence of BRD. Also, the mean serum anti-BCV antibody abundance for a group of calves was inversely related to the subsequent incidence of BRD in that group. However, serum anti-BCV antibody abundance at weaning for individual calves within a group was not predictive of which calves would subsequently require treatment for BRD.</p><p>For the calves of the present study, the rate of BCV shedding prior to weaning differed among the 4 herds of origin and over time; however, the BCV shedding pattern was not associated with serum anti-BCV antibody abundance. Dams of the calves were vaccinated with a vaccine containing an enteric BCV strain 30 days before the start of calving season to facilitate the passive transfer of anti-BCV antibodies via colostrum and aid in the prevention of diarrhea in calves. We hypothesized that BCV-induced disease outbreaks would occur in preweaned calves when a certain proportion of that population lost protective immunity owing to the natural decline of maternally derived anti-BCV antibodies. However, despite significant differences in the prevalence of BCV shedding among herds at the initial vaccination (20 to 70 days old) and weaning (130 to 190 days old) time points, no association was observed between mean anti-BCV antibody abundance and prevalence of respiratory virus shedding. Furthermore, within-herd analyses indicated that the mean serum anti-BCV antibody abundance did not differ significantly between calves that were and were not shedding BCV. These results suggested that the serum anti-BCV antibody abundance as determined by use of a currently available ELISA did not accurately predict BCV shedding in individual beef calves prior to weaning and were consistent with findings of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">26</ref> involving preweaned dairy calves in which subclinical and recurrent BCV infections, albeit common, are not correlated with serum anti-BCV antibody titers. Differences in the rate of BCV shedding by preweaned calves among the 4 herds of origin were likely a function of the extent of exposure those calves had to the virus.</p><p>Contrary to serum anti-BCV antibody abundance, the prevalence of BCV shedding by preweaned calves in a herd appeared to be positively correlated with the incidence of BRD in those calves. The BRD incidence rate in preweaned calves was greatest for herds <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>-Scatterplots of the relative serum anti-BCV antibody abundance for a subset of calves from herds 2 (circles; n = 13) and 3 (squares; 21) that were evaluated at 18 to 48 hours old, initial vaccination, and weaning. Prior to feedlot entry, BCV shedding was not detected in any of the calves evaluated from herd 2, but it was detected in 23 of 180 calves evaluated in herd 3. The subset of calves from herd 3 represented in this figure included 8 calves from which BCV was detected in nasal swab specimens prior to feedlot entry. *Within a sample acquisition time, mean relative anti-BCV antibody abundance differs significantly (P ≤ 0.001) between the 2 herds. See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for remainder of key.</p><p>1 (2/138 [1.4%]) and 3 <ref type="bibr">(25/226 [11%]</ref>), the 2 herds in which calves shedding BCV were detected. Nasal swab specimens for pathogen detection were not collected at the time of BRD diagnosis from preweaned calves; therefore, it is unknown whether BCV was involved in the pathogenesis of clinical BRD in those calves. Herdlevel risk factors associated with BRD in preweaned beef calves include large herd size, incidence rate of diarrhea in calves, duration of calving season, and introduction of cattle from outside sources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[34]</ref> None of those factors were associated with the incidence of BRD in preweaned calves for the USMARC herds involved in the present study, although the introduction of outside cattle could not be assessed because those herds are closed populations. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">35</ref> the incidence of BRD in preweaned calves was negatively associated with dam parity (ie, calves from young cows were more likely to develop BRD than calves from older cows), which the investigators attributed to improvements in the quality and quantity of colostrum and milk, and thereby the passive transfer of maternally derived antibodies to calves, as cows age. Interestingly, the herd with the highest incidence of BRD in preweaned calves in the present study (herd 3) had the highest median dam parity. Additionally, mean serum anti-BCV antibody abundance for calves at 18 to 48 hours old did not differ significantly between the herds that did (herds 1 and 3) and did not have (herds 2 and 4) BCV or BRD detected in preweaned calves, which further suggested that passive transfer of maternally derived anti-BCV antibodies was not associated with BCV shedding or the risk for development of BRD. In fact, in the study reported here, BCV shedding was the only factor evaluated that was significantly associated with BRD incidence in calves both before and after weaning.</p><p>In the present study, the prevalence of calves shedding BCV was fairly low prior to weaning, but it was quite high during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry. In fact, BCV was detected in the nasal swab specimens collected from all calves that developed BRD (cases) and apparently healthy calves (controls) evaluated during the first 2 weeks after feedlot entry. This indicated that BCV infection was associated with both subclinical and clinical disease. However, the amount of BCV RNA detected in the nasal swab specimens of cases was significantly greater than that detected in the nasal swab specimens of controls, which suggested that disease severity was positively associated with viral load. Results of other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref> indicate that the rate of seroconversion to BCV can be as high as 100% in beef calves during the first few weeks after feedlot entry, which suggests that BCV transmission among calves is common at feedlot entry. In the present study, BCV shedding remained a significant factor in the development of BRD in calves during weeks 3 through 5 after feedlot entry. Furthermore, during weeks 3 through 5 after feedlot entry, M bovis was detected in nasal swab specimens from a significantly greater proportion of cases <ref type="bibr">(18/27</ref> [67%]) than controls <ref type="bibr">(13/57</ref> [23%]), which suggested that the presence of both BCV and M bovis in the nasopharynx in conjunction with other stressors (eg, weaning and changing pens) may have contributed to the development of BRD in calves during that period.</p><p>The role of BCV in the development of BRD in calves was further supported by the fact that, in the present study, the mean serum anti-BCV antibody abundance for a group of calves at weaning was inversely associated with the incidence of BRD for those calves during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry. Mean serum anti-BCV antibody abundance at weaning for the calves of herd 2 was significantly lower than that for the calves of the other 3 herds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4)</ref>, and calves of herd 2 had the highest incidence of BRD during the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry. As previously mentioned, mean serum anti-BCV antibody abundance for calves at 18 to 48 hours old did not differ among the 4 herds; therefore, the differences observed at weaning were most likely the result of differences in BCV exposure rather than differences in passive transfer of maternally derived antibodies. The findings of the present study were consistent with results of other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref> that have indicated BCV infection before weaning is protective against development of BRD after weaning and that calves with high serum anti-BCV antibody abundance at feedlot entry are less likely to develop BRD than calves with low serum anti-BCV antibody abundance. However, in the study reported here, contrary to other studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14</ref>,21 the serum anti-BCV antibody titer at weaning for individual calves was not predictive of which calves would be treated for BRD after feedlot entry.</p><p>The reasons serum anti-BCV antibody abundance was not associated with BCV shedding or BRD incidence in preweaned and weaned beef calves in the present study are unknown. The ELISA used to measure anti-BCV antibodies in the present study detected total reactive rather than neutralizing antibodies. It is also possible that anti-BCV antibodies generated in response to a natural infection might have had a weak protective effect against viral replication, which would protect against the development of clinical signs of disease but not against virus shedding. That would be consistent with results of other studies, which indicate that subclinical BCV infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[26]</ref> and recurrent or intermittent <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">26</ref> shedding of BCV are common. It also may suggest a lack of long-term protective immunity after natural infection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">8</ref> The role of cell-mediated immunity in the mediation of viral shedding in calves with BRD is poorly characterized. It is possible that cell-mediated immune responses may correlate with BCV shedding and the development of BRD better than serum anti-BCV antibody abundance. Finally, BCV shedding and the serum anti-BCV antibody abundance were evaluated in the calves of this study fairly infrequently from birth through the first 5 weeks after feedlot entry. Thus, we based our results on a series of snapshots in time. Calves that were not identified as BCV shedders may have shed BCV between sample acquisition times, which might have masked the effect of serum anti-BCV antibody abundance on BCV shedding. Future studies should be designed to distinguish between these possibilities and determine the best immune correlates of protection for BCV infection.</p><p>In the present study, detection of BCV in nasal swab specimens obtained from preweaned beef calves was associated with the incidence of BRD in those calves before and after weaning. Also, the mean anti-BCV antibody abundance at weaning for a group of calves was inversely associated with the incidence of BRD for those calves after feedlot entry, which suggested that calves infected with BCV prior to weaning were protected against BRD after weaning and feedlot entry. However, the serum anti-BCV antibody abundance at weaning for individual calves was not predictive of which calves would be treated for BRD after feedlot entry. Although BCV shedding (which was presumably indicative of infection) was not associated with death in the present study, BCV infection can have adverse effects on calf health and well-being as well as feedlot productivity owing to a decrease in weight gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">20</ref> and increase in veterinary care costs for affected calves. Thus, generation of immunity against BCV in calves prior to feedlot entry should decrease the incidence of BRD and associated adverse animal health issues and production losses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">20</ref> Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of BCV in the pathogenesis of BRD in beef cattle at various stages of the production cycle. Such information is necessary to guide BCV vaccine development and control strategies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The incidence rate of BRD for herd 2 (51/413 [12%]) was significantly great- er than that for herds 1 (3/138 [2%]), 3 (12/226 [5%]), and 4 (4/113 [4%]).</figDesc></figure>
