Although it could be suspected that these isolates were originating from the vaccine previously used, the clinical symptoms observed during these outbreaks tends to eliminate this possibility. Furthermore, one isolate was recovered from a nonvaccinated flock suggesting that the virulent Connecticut serotype was present in Quebec at this time.

All the other isolates were recovered from birds vaccinated 11 days to 15 weeks before the onset of the illness. Respiratory signs predominated in 23 of the 24 outbreaks. Nephritis-nephrosis was the pre- dominant lesion in two outbreaks and a severe dropping in egg pro- duction was observed in one out- break. Detailed examination of submitted cases did not find a correlation between the different serotypes of identified viruses and onset of disease, seasons and trans- portation from an area to another.

52nd INTRODUCTION 
In 1969 (9), it was reported that 
of ten strains of avian infectious 
bronchitis virus (IBV) isolated in 
Quebec, nine were classified as 
Massachusetts and one as Connec-

ANTISERA 

Specific antisera against the 
reference strains were produced in 
groups of ten SPF birds, four 
weeks of age. Strict environmental 
procedures were taken to prevent 
contamination from outside sour-
ces. All the birds were bled one 
week prior to inoculation with the 
strains of viruses and all of them 
were proven to be free of antibo-
dies against all these viruses. The 
birds were infected with a virus 
suspension containing 10.15-to 107-5 

EID50/0.1 mL and administered as 

follows: two drops intraocularly, 
0.25 mL intratracheally and 2 mL 
subcutaneously. Twenty-one days 
later, the birds were reinoculated 
intravenously with 1 mL of the 
virus suspension and were bled on 
the 28th day. The sera collected 
from each bird in each group were 
pooled and stored at -20°C in small 
aliquots until needed. 

SERUM NEUTRALIZATION TEST 

The antisera were inactivated at 
56°C for 30 minutes prior to their 
use in the in ovo serum neutraliza-
tion test using varying virus con-
stant serum method as described 
by Hofstad (6). 

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEY 

RESULTS 

SPECIFICITY OF THE 
HOMOLOGOUS ANTISERA 

As shown in Table II, all antisera 
produced to the reference strains 
were specific except for antiserum 
to strain SE-17 which showed an 
apparent one way neutralization 
with the Gray strain.

Consequently, it is con- cluded that ten out of 24 isolates were of the Connecticut type. Seven isolates did not react with antisera to the 13 reference strains. However, these should not be necessarily considered as new serological types. Due to the fact that only 13 types out of a possibil- ity of 20 have been used in this work, a more complete study, by TABLE II.
