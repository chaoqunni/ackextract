<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Epidemics caused by influenza viruses result in the highest number of vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide annually. Influenza viruses have also caused several pandemics in the last century, including the 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu pandemic that resulted in up to 40 million deaths, the 1957 H2N2 Asian flu pandemic with a death toll of 1.5 million worldwide, and the 1968 H3N2 Hong Kong flu pandemic with about 1 million deaths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Influenza pandemics occur when a population with low herd immunity encounters a newly emerged influenza virus that can be transmitted efficiently. In April 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the emergence of a novel influenza that originated from Mexico and spread around the world. This was subsequently declared as the first influenza pandemic of the 21 st century in June 2009. The 2009 pandemic influenza virus (pH1N1 2009) originated from a triple-reassortant virus that had been circulating in swine during the preceding 10 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The pandemic virus caused a high morbidity rate amongst younger age groups, but a relatively low overall mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Pre-existing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p>The recent H1N1 pandemic virus that emerged in 2009 resulted in high morbidity rates mainly in younger individuals, albeit with relatively low mortality. We investigated both humoral and cellular immune responses against the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus before and after immunization with inactivated H1N1 2009 vaccine. Methods: We obtained paired blood specimens from a cohort of participants from nursing homes (n = 108) and a public hospital (n = 60) in Singapore. Serum samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies against H1N1 2009 using microneutralization assays, while peripheral blood mononuclear cells were subjected to interferon-g enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays for whole virus-specific T-cell responses.</p><p>Results: We observed significant increases in geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies after H1N1 2009 vaccination (from 23.6 pre-vaccination to 94.7 post-vaccination). Approximately 77% and 54% of the cohort exhibited !2-fold and !4-fold increases in neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination; 89.9% of the cohort had a post-vaccination antibody titer of !32. Adjusted for gender, participants aged !60 years were less likely to have a !4-fold increase in antibody titers after vaccination than those aged &lt;60 years (0.48; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.32-0.71, p = 0.007).</p><p>There was a 1.4-fold elevation in H1N1 2009-specific T-cell responses after vaccination (p &lt; 0.05). Adjusted for gender, age !60 years was positively associated with a greater increase in T-cell response (b = 4.9, 95% CI 1. killing cells that present foreign antigens, the immune system will 'remember' the infection through memory cells, which will recognize and react to any future infection by related strains. By simultaneously measuring both humoral and cellular responses before and after vaccination, the efficacy of the relatively new pH1N1 2009 vaccine in triggering these responses during an infection can be assessed. The objective of this study was to assess both humoral and cellular responses to pH1N1 2009 vaccination, identify any differences in pre-existing immunity, and examine the responses following vaccine challenge by key demographic characteristics, namely age and gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study design and sources of samples</head><p>Two sets of blood samples were collected from participants, one prior to pH1N1 2009 vaccination and the other at 4-6 weeks after vaccination. To include subjects from a wide range of ages, we recruited consenting participants from four groups of individuals who were offered pH1N1 2009 vaccination between <ref type="bibr">November 16, 2009 and</ref><ref type="bibr">March 11, 2010</ref>. Participants were residents from three nursing homes in Singapore (Jamiyah Home, Bukit Batok Home, and Christalite Methodist Home) and healthcare staff of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, who provided paired samples for the isolation of serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serum samples and PBMCs were then prepared from the blood samples for the microneutralization assay and the interferon gamma (IFN-g) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay, respectively. Microneutralization assays were performed to measure the level of neutralizing antibodies in serum as an indicator of the humoral immune response. ELISPOT assays were used to detect the number of spots formed by IFN-g-producing influenza-specific T-cells present within the PBMCs as a measure of the cellular immune response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Processing of serum and PBMC samples</head><p>Serum from the test participants was heat-inactivated at 56 8C for 30 min and stored at À80 8C until use in the microneutralization assay. For the isolation of PBMCs, Ficoll-Paque PLUS solution at a density of 1.077 g/ml (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to underlay the whole blood samples, which were subsequently centrifuged at 900 g at 18-20 8C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the whole blood was separated into its respective components, and the buffy coat containing the PBMCs was extracted. The PBMCs were then washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline and resuspended in freezing medium comprising RPMI-1640, 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10% dimethylsulfoxide. PBMC samples were aliquoted and stored at À80 8C until use in the ELISPOT assays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Influenza virus and vaccine</head><p>Influenza H1N1 A/Singapore/GP2651/2009 virus strain isolated in Singapore during the H1N1 2009 pandemic was used for both the microneutralization and ELISPOT assays. This virus is highly homologous to the vaccine strain, and was propagated in MadinDarby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM). Study participants were immunized with the Panvax inactivated split H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine derived from the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus-like strain propagated in eggs (CSL, Melbourne, Australia).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Microneutralization assay</head><p>MDCK cells were first seeded into 96-well flat bottom plates and incubated at 37 8C with 5% CO 2 for 24 h to obtain confluent monolayers. Serial two-fold dilutions of each serum sample were prepared using EMEM as diluent starting with the 1:8 dilution. Equal volumes of 100 TCID 50 (median tissue culture infective dose) of H1N1 A/Singapore/GP2651/2009 virus were incubated with the diluted serum samples at 35 8C with 5% CO 2 for 2 h.</p><p>The cells were washed three times before adding serum-free medium containing 3 mg/ml of tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin, then inoculated with 50 ml of the virusserum mixtures and incubated at 35 8C with 5% CO 2 for 72 h before observing for cytopathic effect (CPE) with an inverted microscope to assess any residual viral replication. The neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the serum at which the infectivity of 100 TCID 50 of the virus for MDCK cells was completely neutralized in 50% of the wells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">IFN-g ELISPOT assay</head><p>The secretion of IFN-g was detected by ELISPOT assay. Multiscreen 96-well plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were coated overnight at 4 8C with 5 mg/ml of anti-human IFN-g capture antibody (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden). Plates were blocked with AIM-V medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 h at room temperature. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, washed, and added to the plates in triplicate at 10 5 per well in AIM-V medium supplemented with 2% human serum, and then incubated at 37 8C for 5 h. Concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 5 mg/ml was included as the positive control to ensure the viability of the PBMCs tested, while filtered pandemic H1N1 A/GP2651/2009 strain was added to the test wells at a multiplicity of infection of 3 before further incubation at 37 8C for 16 h. Plain medium with PBMCs served as negative control. Medium control wells contained supernatant obtained from flasks in which H1N1 2009 was passaged in MDCK cells. This was to test whether the medium would give rise to non-specific production of IFN-g.</p><p>Plates were washed and incubated for 2 h with 2 mg/ml of biotinylated anti-IFN-g secondary detection antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), followed by 1 h incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase enzyme and substrate (BD Biosciences) at room temperature. 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) chromogen in substrate solution (BD Biosciences) was added to each well for spot development and the plates were then read by an automated ELISPOT reader (Cellular Technology, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). One spot formed in a well reflects one IFN-gproducing cell, and the size of the spot is proportional to the amount of IFN-g produced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Mean spot-forming units (SFU)</p><p>were calculated after subtracting the number of spots in the negative well from the test well. Samples were considered to be positive for a T-cell response if the number of H1N1-specific IFN-gproducing spots was above five when the negative control was zero, or at least two times the mean SFU of the negative control when the negative control was above zero.</p><p>16,17</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Statistical analyses</head><p>For humoral immunity, the geometric mean titer (GMT) and fold-change were analyzed. For calculation of the GMT, antibody titers less than 8 were assigned a value of 4, while titers more than 1024 were assigned a value of 2048. The fold-change was then calculated by dividing the post-vaccination antibody titer by the pre-vaccination antibody titer. A paired sample t-test was employed to compare antibody titers and T-cell responses before and after vaccination. Using the Chi-square test, we assessed if age and gender were associated with pre-vaccination and postvaccination titers !32, as well as with a !4-fold change in antibody titers (the cut-off neutralizing antibody titer of !32 is similar to that used in other pH1N1 2009 vaccine studies). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used, with robust standard errors computed, the grouping variable being the respective institutions of the participants.</p><p>We compared T-cell responses elicited pre-and post-vaccination, with the change response being the post-vaccination minus the pre-vaccination T-cell response. In addition, using the unpaired sample t-test, we assessed whether age and gender were associated with pre-vaccination and post-vaccination T-cell responses. As there are no established cut-off points for T-cell responses, the relationship between age and gender, pre-and postvaccination T-cell ELISPOT responses, and changes in T-cell ELISPOT values were analyzed on a continuous scale using multivariate linear regression, again using robust standard errors.</p><p>We also utilized Spearman correlation to assess the relationship between neutralizing antibody titers and T-cell responses. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA software version 10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Standard confidence intervals, p-value intervals, robust standard errors and associated p-values in the regression analyses are presented where appropriate. In all analyses, two-tailed p-values of &lt;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p></div>

The age of participants ranged from 22 to 93 years, with a mean of 58.0 years and median of 64 years. For our regression analyses, we divided the cohort into two age groups (&lt;60 and !60 years); 56.5% of participants were aged !60 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Pre-and post-vaccination changes in neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses</head><p>The pre-and post-vaccination H1N1 2009 influenza-specific antibody responses are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>. More than half (52.4%) of the cohort had a pre-vaccination antibody titer of !32, and this proportion increased to 89.9% post-vaccination. The geometric mean titer increased from 23.6 pre-vaccination to 94.7 postvaccination (p &lt; 0.001, paired t-test), a mean rise of about 4-fold. Of the cohort, 53.6% displayed a !4-fold increase, while 77.4% exhibited a !2-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers against the pandemic virus.</p><p>The pre-and post-vaccination H1N1 2009-specific T-cell responses are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>. Furthermore, 68.5% of the participants revealed a positive T-cell response before vaccination. The mean SFU per 10 5 PBMCs increased significantly from 9.2 SFU pre-vaccination to 13.8 SFU post-vaccination (p &lt; 0.001, paired ttest), with an average fold increase of 1.39.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Differences in neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses by age and gender</head><p>There were significant differences in the prevalence of pre-and post-vaccination neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses, as  well as the change in antibody titers and T-cell responses following vaccination, between age and gender groups ( Unlike the antibody responses, the older age group showed significantly greater increases in T-cell responses after vaccination compared to the younger age group (6.7 vs. 1.7, p = 0.040). Some gender differences were also observed, with males having a significantly higher prevalence of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> Differences by age and gender in pre-vaccination, post-vaccination virus neutralization titers and T-cell responses, including changes in antibody titers and T-cell responses.  pre-vaccination antibody titers !32, lower probability of achieving a !4-fold increase in titers, and higher pre-and post-vaccination Tcell responses.</p><p>We assessed the extent that these differences could be explained by confounding in multivariate regression models. On multivariate analysis, older age remained significantly associated with higher pre-vaccination titers !32 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.34, p &lt; 0.001) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A</ref>). However, older age was not associated with higher post-vaccination titers after accounting for the effect of higher pre-vaccination titers (adjusted OR 1.80, p = 0.130). On the other hand, we found that older individuals were still less likely to exhibit a !4-fold increase in titers (adjusted OR 0.48, p &lt; 0.001), even after adjusting for the effect from higher pre-vaccination antibody titers. None of the associations observed with gender remained significant in the multivariate analyses, while prevaccination titers were independently associated with higher postvaccination titers and with less likelihood of a !4-fold increase in titers.</p><p>On multivariate regression, older age remained significantly associated both with higher pre-and post-vaccination T-cell </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we simultaneously studied humoral and cellular immune responses following stimulation with a monovalent inactivated H1N1 2009 pandemic virus vaccine. The pH1N1 2009 vaccine (Panvax) used in our study was a purified, inactivated, monovalent, split virion vaccine containing antigens of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1-like virus). In concordance with other vaccine studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> we found that more than half of the cohort exhibited a !4-fold increase in antibody titers, with close to 90% achieving neutralization titers of !32 following vaccination. Compared to live attenuated influenza vaccines, it is generally thought that inactivated influenza vaccines are inefficient in inducing strong cytotoxic T-cell responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Our study revealed significant increases in T-cell responses after vaccination. However, there was no concordance between the antibody and T-cell responses, a result that concurs with a previous finding in individuals vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in 2008, suggesting that vaccination does not trigger equivalent humoral and cellular responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Moreover, there were important age-related differences in the T-cell responses compared to the antibody responses to vaccination, with older individuals showing both higher pre-vaccination antibody titers and T-cell responses to pH1N1 2009. The association between older age and higher pre-vaccination antibody titers was documented by Hancock et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The existence of such cross-reactive antibodies may be explained by prior exposure to the more closely related H1N1 strains, especially those that share similar T-cell epitopes, most likely during their childhood years when strains antecedent to the H1N1 2009 pandemic were circulating. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Furthermore, there is antigenic similarity between the hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes of pH1N1 1918 and pH1N1 2009 viruses, while antibody obtained from 1918 H1N1 pandemic survivors has high affinity to pH1N1 2009 viral HA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> The higher pre-vaccination T-cell responses could similarly be attributed to previous exposure to related viruses, so that older individuals are more likely than younger adults to harbor memory B-cells that produce cross-reactive antibodies, as well as memory T-cells capable of recognizing epitopes on the pH1N1 2009 virus. However, it is interesting that we found that older individuals were less likely to achieve !4-fold increases in antibody titers than younger adults, even after adjusting for their higher pre-vaccination titers which are known to reduce the probability of observing a further increase in titers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> while at the same time exhibiting stronger T-cell responses than younger adults following stimulation with inactivated pH1N1 2009 vaccine. Previously, others have also observed that older age groups have a lower likelihood of seroconverting after seasonal influenza vaccination, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Woodland and Blackman have postulated that humoral responses decrease with age. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> However, naïve Tcell responses decrease with age, so that memory T-cell responses become the main T-cell responses in the elderly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> We suggest the following explanation for our findings. Firstly, the observed antibody increase is likely due to the vaccine stimulating predominantly naïve B-cells in both the young and the old, with the humoral responses being stronger in younger individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> However, because T-cell epitopes are relatively more conserved than B-cell epitopes, 27 the pH1N1 2009 strain on which the vaccine was based was better able to stimulate memory T-cell responses compared to memory B-cell responses. Older individuals were probably primed with previously circulating H1N1 strains, and hence harbored relevant memory T-cell responses. The reason why older age was independently associated with the changes in pre-and post-vaccination T-cell responses may be attributed to the effect of memory T-cell responses in the older age group outweighing the naïve T-cell responses in the younger age group. The above interpretation of our findings, if correct, has several implications both for understanding the epidemiology of pH1N1 2009 influenza and for the use and design of future seasonal and pre-pandemic vaccines. Firstly, we suggest that memory T-cells in particular may be playing a larger role in protecting against symptomatic infection than is commonly thought. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> This would explain why older adults had substantially lower symptomatic infection and seroconversion rates than younger adults, despite the fact that the majority of these individuals in the community did not have antibodies to pH1N1 2009 at levels that are considered protective. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Secondly, with regards to influenza vaccines, there is at least a theoretical concern that the widespread use of inactivated vaccine formulations that prevent natural infection but which do not adequately stimulate naïve Tcell responses in younger individuals may lead to more severe outcomes in future pandemics, should related influenza subtypes be re-introduced into the population (as was the case for pH1N1 2009), particularly since T-cell epitopes tend to be relatively more conserved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Given that there is substantial evidence that individuals who received seasonal influenza vaccines had an increased risk of medically attended influenza during the early waves of pH1N1 2009 infections, such findings may also be related to inadequate T-cell-mediated immunity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> What is needed therefore is to further clarify the role of T-cell immunity in protection against influenza, possibly through cohort studies measuring T-cell responses against specific strains prior to influenza outbreaks to see if certain correlates of protection can be ascertained. Quantifying the role of T-cell immunity in protecting against influenza may also yield improved strategies for the development of pre-pandemic vaccines targeted at relatively well-conserved T-cell epitopes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> since it is difficult for pre-pandemic vaccines to be cost-effective without a reasonably high degree of cross-protection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Our study has several limitations. Firstly, our inclusion of the four groups of participants was opportunistic. Ideally, we would have liked to have performed the study in groups of individuals who were similar in all aspects other than age, but we had to recruit a mix of healthcare staff and residents from long-term care facilities to assemble a cohort with the range of age groups necessary for meaningful analyses. Notably, the observed associations between immunity and gender on univariate analyses likely resulted from our choice of study population, since the healthcare staff were largely younger females while the residents comprised older individuals of both genders. Some of the observed pre-vaccination immunity may be due to natural infection with pH1N1 2009 during the epidemic in Singapore from June to September 2009, although it should be noted that estimated infection rates in the long-term care facilities and the healthcare institution included in our study were reasonably low, i.e. less than 10% in our previous study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Secondly, unlike conventional ELISPOT, the whole virus was used in our experiments instead of peptides to stimulate the PBMCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>33,34</head><p>The use of whole virus in ELISPOT allows us to mimic actual influenza infection in vivo, where actively replicating viruses interact directly with immune cells. Since the objective of this study was to ascertain whether individuals vaccinated against pH1N1 2009 were able to generate humoral and cellular immune responses, we believe this is a valid approach. Due to the limited quantity of blood sample and PBMC number obtained from each subject, the CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations were not analyzed separately. Hence, further studies may be helpful for distinguishing the contributions of the responses of the two T-cell subsets, and for identifying the relevant specific T-cell epitopes.</p><p>In conclusion, our study has revealed that there was a substantial prevalence of pre-vaccination antibodies as well as T-cell responses to the pH1N1 2009 virus, particularly in individuals aged 60 years and above. The pH1N1 2009 vaccine (Panvax) stimulated both antibody production and the T-cell response. While we observed no correlation between humoral and cellular immunity, we found that there were important age-related differences in the changes observed in humoral and cellular immunity following vaccination, with individuals born before 1950 having lower seroconversion rates but more robust increases in T-cell responses. We suggest this may be due to stimulation of memory T-cells in the elderly, and propose that memory T-cells may play an important role in affording protection for older persons against influenza infections.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

No significant correlation was observed between humoral and cellular immune responses. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination elicits significant neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses to pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus. However, in response to vaccination, increases in neutralizing antibody titers were comparatively lower but T-cell responses were higher in older participants. Therefore, our study suggests that memory T-cells may play a crucial role in protecting older individuals against pandemic H1N1 2009 infection. ß 2012 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

in elderly individuals over 65 years of age, but none or very low 
levels of antibodies were observed in adults and children.

observations could potentially be explained by cross-reactivity 
between pandemic H1N1 2009 and older H1N1 strains circulating 
before 1950. 

8,9 

Influenza epidemics and pandemics are usually caused by 
antigenic drift and shift, respectively. 
10 Influenza vaccines confer 

protection by triggering memory B-cells to rapidly produce 
antibodies and specific T-cell responses upon infection. 
11 Howev-

er, vaccines need to be updated annually to address the antigenic 
drift culminating from the high mutation rates of influenza 
viruses. 
12 In addition, antigenic shift is largely unpredictable, 

rendering seasonal influenza vaccines relatively ineffective for 
pandemic influenza strains. For instance, the 2008-2009 seasonal 
influenza vaccines (inactivated and live, attenuated influenza 
vaccines) were found to induce little or no cross-reactive antibody 
responses to pH1N1 2009 in any age group. 
7 However, the 

antibody response is only one aspect of adaptive immunity, since 
influenza virus infection also activates cellular immunity in the 
human host. Antibodies are produced by B-cells to neutralize the 
virus, while cytotoxic T-cells kill infected cells by binding to 
epitopes presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
