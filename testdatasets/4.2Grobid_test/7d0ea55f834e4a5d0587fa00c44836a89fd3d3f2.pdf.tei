<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since December 2019, cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, new coronavirus pneumonia) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The disease spreads rapidly and patients infected suffered from several complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3]</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. The Technical Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Infection in</head><p>Medical Institutions (First Edition) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> points out that when medical personnel contact patients with COVID-19, they need to take protective measures such as droplet isolation, contact isolation, and air isolation. Intravenous infusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> is an important treatment method in the designated hospital for this epidemic. Nurses need to wear multiple layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) in isolation wards <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, including disposable caps, protective goggles, protective face shields, N95 masks, full-body protective clothing, disposable isolation gown, two layers of shoe covers, and at least two layers of latex gloves. Compared with working in general wards, their physical and mental burdens are greater <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, as such, difficulties in nursing operation increase, the time to perform the work is longer, work efficiency decreases, and patients' satisfaction decreases due to long waiting time for treatment. Process reengineering is a management idea put forward by Michael Hammer and Jame Champy of the United States. Its purpose is to improve overall work efficiency by optimizing the process. It has been applied to the management of various fields in China and other countries, and has achieved good results <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>. Its core idea is to improve work efficiency and optimize productivity by reorganizing and optimizing the organization, composition, and operation steps in enterprise processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Its main approaches include equipment renewal, material substitution, step simplification, time sequence adjustment, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. In process optimization and implementation, continuous improvement should be made to the process in order to obtain the best results. This theory has been applied to management by enterprises and has also achieved good results in hospital management, such as surgical management <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, ward-nursing operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>, chronic-disease management <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, and others. To improve the efficiency of intravenous infusion treatment in the isolation ward, our hospital used reengineering theory to evaluate the infusion workflow, searched for the steps that could be improved, optimized the process, and achieved good results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Participants and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>The study subjects included 30 patients treated in the isolation ward of our hospital and 30 There were three isolation wards in our hospital. Nurses work in 4-hour shifts. There were four nurses on duty in the morning, three in the afternoon, and two at all other times. The nurses were all women, with age of 33.25±4.38 years, median nursing experience of 10 years (range 4-29), and 27 with bachelor's degrees.</p><p>All subjects voluntarily participated in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Methods</head><p>From January 19 to 24, 2020, the intravenous-infusion workflow before optimization in the isolation ward was as follows: 1) The medical personnel wearing PPE entered the isolation area; 2) Doctors entered medical orders into the computer information system after examining patients; 3)</p><p>Medical-order-processing nurses checked prescriptions; 4) Medical-order-processing nurses printed intravenous infusion sheets and labels; 5) Drug-dispensing nurses double-checked and prepare drug solutions; 6) Two responsible nurses double-check and administer the intravenous infusion. All steps were carried out in the isolation area.</p><p>Process reengineering includes five main steps including establishing the process improvement team, identifying the process steps to be improved, re-optimizing the process, implementing the optimized process, and evaluating the new process. This study used this approach to optimize the intravenous infusion workflow and evaluated the optimized workflow in isolation ward for patients with COVID-19 from January 25 to 30, 2020.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Organizing a team to manage the intravenous infusion workflow</head><p>According to China's guidelines for outbreak control of hospital infections, prevention and control of hospital infections needs to be managed by a team of multidisciplinary experts in clinical medicine, nursing, epidemiology, management, microbiology, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>. Intravenous administration management is an important treatment method in hospital, and its process optimization requires team cooperation. This research team consisted of a chief physician, a chief nurse, a head nurse of isolation ward, an infection-control expert, and two responsible nursing-team leaders. Each step of the infusion workflow was evaluated to identify if it could be improved or not. Then, the optimized design was carried out, optimized process were formulated, nurses were organized for training, the status of process-operation was recorded, and supervision and feedback were incorporated into the process implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Formulating an optimized intravenous infusion workflow</head><p>The managing team evaluated the original intravenous-infusion workflow for patients with COVID-19, evaluated all steps and consulted relevant data, and found that there were problems with the routine workflow. Wearing goggles and face shields affected nurses' vision and hearing, causing difficulties in communication and verification <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Wearing a full set of PPE increased the operational difficulties. Some process could be conducted outside the isolation area, such as documentary medical-order processing, printing infusion itineration sheets and labels, drug preparation and intravenous admixture.</p><p>The managing team conducted a feasibility analysis based on the actual situation and decided the optimization strategies as follows. 1) Setting up a special, hygienic medical-order-processing and drug-dispensing area near the isolation area. 2) Relocating medical-order processing to the hygienic area outside of the isolation area, where nurses do not need to wear a full set of PPE. 3)</p><p>Relocating intravenous admixture to the hygienic area outside of the isolation area. Nurses in this area do not need to wear PPE. The optimized intravenous infusion workflow is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1.</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Training of medical staff and implement the optimized infusion workflow</head><p>Strengthening training on relevant knowledge for doctors was conducted, such as updated diagnosis and treatment plan for patients with COVID-19. Doctors were requested to determine the treatment plan and entered medical orders according to standards. Front-line nurses were trained on their tasks and responsibilities in the optimized workflow. Training on knowledge and skills to use electronic products were provided to improve work efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Outcome measurements</head><p>We compared the following indicators before and after the optimization of the infusion workflow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.1.">Work efficiency. The infusion efficiency data measured by working-hour is relatively</head><p>accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Time-motion was used to measure work efficiency of the optimized workflow. At the beginning of the study, the nurses participating in the study were trained on measurement methods, equipped with timers, and instructed on the correct use of timers and recording. 1) Preparation time: The time required for the medical-order-reviewing nurse to review the medical order and print the intravenous infusion sheets and infusion labels after a doctor made medical prescriptions; 2) Intravenous admixture time: The time required for verification, laying out of drugs, preparing drug-administration supplies, disinfection, reconstituting drugs, re-verification, and handling drug administration supplies; 3) Wait time for each patient: The time from verification of a medical order by the medical-order-reviewing nurse to starting of the intravenous infusion..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.2.">Patient satisfaction.</head><p>On the last day of the two study periods, i.e., January 24 and 30, 2020, a questionnaire was completed using a self-made electronic questionnaire on the satisfaction of patients with novel coronavirus infection with the nursing care that they received. The questionnaire was based on the Inpatient Satisfaction and Experience Monitoring Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and the Press Ganey Patient Satisfaction Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, with a total of 15 queries. The Likert scoring method was used. Scores of 1 to 4 points indicate "very dissatisfied," "dissatisfied," "satisfied,"</p><p>and "very satisfied," with a total score of 60 points. In this study, a total score ≥40 points was regarded as satisfied and &lt;40 points as dissatisfied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.4.3.</head><p>Cost of protective materials. The direct observation method was used to record the numbers of PPE consumed (including protective clothing, gloves, caps, goggles, N95 masks, shoe covers, and face shields) and their disposal cost for 5 days during the two study periods, the average values were compared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">3. Statistical methods</head><p>Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS software, version 20.0. The work efficiency and cost of PPE were expressed with mean and standard deviation (SD), and a t-test was used to compare the data obtained before and after optimization of the workflow. Patient satisfaction was measured by enumeration data and chi-square test was used to compare satisfaction before and after optimization of the workflow. P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>During major public-health emergencies, PPE often becomes scarce resource. Once PPE is no longer available, it becomes extremely difficult to carry out rescue work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Given the shortage in PPE, the managing team of intravenous infusion workflow optimization conducted a feasibility analysis based on the current situation and optimized the whole workflow, by which not only the work efficacy and patients satisfaction were improved, but also the cost of PPE was reduced.</p><p>Infusion treatment is a key index for evaluating nursing quality, safety, and efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, that takes up a lot of time of nursing in China. In 2016, China issued the Planning Outline of Healthy China 2030, which raises the improvement of nursing efficiency and service quality to the height of national strategic management <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. In this study, the transfusion process was modified according to process reengineering theory, which improved infusion efficiency. The core idea of this theory is to reorganize and optimize the organization, composition, and operation of the existing process, and to improve the overall work efficiency and increase income by means of equipment renewal, process simplification, and timing adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. In this study, the medical-order processing and intravenous admixture were not performed in the isolation area, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) were provided to nurses, thus shortening the infusion working time and improving the overall infusion efficiency. The results showed that after optimization, the preparation time before intravenous admixture was shortened from 4.84 minutes to 3.50 minutes;</p><p>the intravenous admixture time, from 4.03 minutes to 2.60 minutes; and the waiting time for each patient shortened. The possible reason was that when providing infusion treatment to patients with COVID-19, the nurses involved in the medical order processing step and intravenous admixture step after optimization did not need to wear heavy PPE; therefore, the influence on vision and hearing were reduced, and the degree of difficulty encountered was lesser than that noted previously. On the premise of ensuring the safety of patients, the overall drug preparation time was effectively shortened, patients were treated in time, and their satisfaction was also improved.</p><p>Due to time and manpower constraints, this study only completed a 12-day survey in 30 patients and 30 nurses. This is the limitation of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>The COVID-19 epidemic is a relatively serious, complicated, and widespread public health concern in the world. The rapid progression of the epidemic poses many challenges to the relevant administrative authorities and medical institutions, including challenges in manpower and material resources. Optimizing workflow based on process reengineering theory provided a potential way to improve work efficiency and reduce PPE consumption during the epidemic.  </p></div>
