<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The volatile nature of modern organizations, which includes downsizing, outsourcing, and restructuring, increases the likelihood for misunderstandings and disagreements with employeeorganization relationships. The uncertainty surrounding these relationships may result in employees perceiving that their organization has failed to meet its reciprocal exchange obligations. Indeed, many employees report that their employer has breached some aspect of their employment agreement <ref type="bibr" coords="1,217.68,541.07,66.09,7.53;1,32.71,551.55,55.90,7.53" target="#b21">(Coyle-Shapiro &amp; Kessler, 2000;</ref>. The goal of our research is to extend current knowledge of employee perceptions of psychological contract breach, which refer to employees' beliefs that their organization has failed to fulfill the terms of an exchange agreement believed to exist between the two parties <ref type="bibr" coords="1,243.48,593.40,40.29,7.53;1,32.71,603.83,21.99,7.53" target="#b76">(Rousseau, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,57.43,603.83,108.93,7.53" target="#b77">Rousseau &amp; Tijoriwala, 1998)</ref>. Our knowledge of the consequences of psychological contract breach is extensive, as breach is consistently found to predict various attitudes and behaviors like work satisfaction and citizenship behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,230.80,635.24,52.98,7.53;1,32.71,645.67,106.75,7.53" target="#b91">Zhao, Wayne, Glibkowski, &amp; Bravo, 2007)</ref>. However, relatively less is known about the factors that lead to global evaluations of psychological contract breach. For example, it is unclear how perceptions of the social context of organizations affect (or are affected by) evaluations that one's psychological contract has been breached <ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.72,467.84,99.93,7.53" target="#b70">(Robinson &amp; Brown, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,404.22,467.84,66.85,7.53" target="#b79">Shore et al., 2004)</ref>. Our research examines how employees' perceptions of two social context aspectsone emanating from observations of others' self-serving behaviors (i.e., organizational politics) and the other from employees' perceptions of decision-making processes (i.e., procedural justice)-relate to employees' evaluations of their psychological contract.</p><p>Perceptions of organizational politics and procedural justice share an underlying theme of fairness <ref type="bibr" coords="1,468.40,541.09,84.42,7.53;1,301.72,551.58,19.77,7.53" target="#b4">(Andrews &amp; Kacmar, 2001)</ref>, and both relate to employees' evaluations of their exchange relationships with organizations <ref type="bibr" coords="1,428.76,562.01,124.02,7.53" target="#b5">(Aryee, Chen, &amp; Budhwar, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.72,572.50,84.78,7.53" target="#b9">Blader &amp; Tyler, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,390.49,572.50,162.28,7.53" target="#b37">Hall, Hochwarter, Ferris, &amp; Bowen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.72,582.93,111.34,7.53" target="#b74">Rosen, Levy, &amp; Hall, 2006)</ref>. Despite apparent linkages with exchange relationship evaluations, it is not clear how employee perceptions of politics and justice relate to perceptions of psychological contract breach. To help resolve this impasse, we examine the distinctiveness of perceived politics, justice, and psychological contract breach, compare their relative effects, and test various models that plausibly explain how these constructs relate to employee attitudes and behaviors.</p><p>Understanding relationships among politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach is important for several reasons. First, each of these constructs has implications for managerial and organizational effectiveness. For example, organizational politics create aversive environments from which employees wish to withdraw <ref type="bibr" coords="1,324.00,718.95,172.15,7.53" target="#b22">(Cropanzano, Howes, Grandey, &amp; Toth, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,499.05,718.95,53.66,7.53" target="#b30">Ferris, Russ, &amp;</ref>   <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,67.96,47.16,7.53" target="#b30">Fandt, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,91.73,67.96,62.78,7.53" target="#b61">Mintzberg, 1983)</ref>, procedural justice affects employee motivation and performance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.72,78.39,55.05,7.53" target="#b33">(Folger, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,220.65,78.39,72.94,7.53;2,42.52,88.88,47.28,7.53" target="#b41">Johnson, Chang, &amp; Rosen, 2006)</ref>, and psychological contract breach is negatively related to employee well-being and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.19,99.31,66.41,7.53" target="#b91">(Zhao et al., 2007)</ref>. Second, organizations can manage employees' perceptions of politics and justice even when psychological contract breach is unavoidable. This is important because it suggests that, by reducing perceptions of politics and injustice, organizations may be able to override negative impressions of employee-organization relationships that are associated with experiencing a psychological contract breach. In addition, knowledge of how organizational politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach interrelate enriches existing research by providing insight into the development of psychological contract breach and its influence on employee attitudes and behaviors. This knowledge also sheds light on the relative importance of politics and fairness for psychological contract perceptions, which can guide practitioners' efforts when implementing interventions designed to address issues concerning psychological contracts. For example, if politics perceptions drive evaluations of the psychological contract, or play a primary role in determining reactions to a perceived breach, then efforts that target only procedural justice will have limited consequences.</p><p>This article is organized into three sections. First, we review the focal constructs (i.e., politics, justice, and psychological contract breach) and discuss how they are conceptually related. We then discuss four theoretically-derived models that specify different ways in which politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach may be related. The detrimental effects that politics, injustice, and contract breach have on work attitudes and behaviors are well documented (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,161.52,371.35,116.81,7.53">Chang, Rosen, &amp; Levy, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,280.74,371.35,8.58,7.53;2,42.52,381.78,113.99,7.53" target="#b17">Cohen-Charash &amp; Spector, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.37,381.78,134.21,7.53;2,42.52,392.27,37.56,7.53" target="#b18">Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, &amp; Ng, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,83.50,392.27,90.52,7.53" target="#b46">Kacmar &amp; Baron, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.38,392.27,116.16,7.53;2,42.52,402.71,21.99,7.53" target="#b71">Robinson, Kraatz, &amp; Rousseau, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,69.78,402.71,171.53,7.53" target="#b87">Wanous, Poland, Premack, &amp; Davis, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,246.65,402.71,46.89,7.53;2,42.52,413.19,19.84,7.53" target="#b91">Zhao et al., 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, a meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.33,413.19,94.27,7.53;2,42.51,423.63,44.68,7.53">Harrison, Neumann, and Roth (2006)</ref> provides evidence that general, work-related attitudes are associated with overall contributions made to one's work role, such as task performance and citizenship behaviors. As such, we refrain from discussing the effects of perceived politics, justice, and breach on employee attitudes and behaviors. Rather, we focus our attention on developing the logic underlying the four models that we examined. In the final section, we present empirical results that address the adequacy of these models for explaining how the focal constructs relate to employee attitudes and behaviors. Results are based on data collected from three separate samples, which enabled us to assess the generalizability of results.</p><p>Psychological contract breach, procedural justice, and perceived politics</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological contract breach</head><p>Employee-organization relationships involve an exchange of employees' time, effort, and loyalty for material and socioemotional benefits from the organization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.53,624.17,117.04,7.53" target="#b6">(Aselage &amp; Eisenberger, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.51,634.60,42.33,7.53" target="#b10">Blau, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,86.73,634.60,150.16,7.53" target="#b68">Porter, Steers, Mowday, &amp; Boulian, 1974)</ref>. Psychological contracts are one way of describing the exchange relationships that develop between employers and employees <ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.35,655.52,40.21,7.53;2,42.51,666.01,19.99,7.53" target="#b76">(Rousseau, 1989)</ref>. The psychological contract refers to employees' idiosyncratic beliefs about the terms and conditions of implied reciprocal exchange agreements between themselves and another party <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.51,697.36,68.41,7.53" target="#b69">(Robinson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,117.40,697.36,63.75,7.53" target="#b76">Rousseau, 1989)</ref>. Specifically, psychological contracts entail ''beliefs about what employees believe they are entitled to receive, or should receive, because they perceive that their employer conveyed promises to provide those things" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.51,739.26,90.21,7.53">(Robinson, 1996, p. 575)</ref>. Thus, an important feature of psycholog-ical contracts is that they are based on perceived promises, explicit or implicit, made by the employer, which typically extend beyond formal contracts. When employees believe that the organization has failed to fulfill obligations contained in the psychological contract, a breach occurs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,392.98,109.86,62.22,7.53" target="#b76">(Rousseau, 1989)</ref>. Psychological contract theorists (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,355.23,120.30,107.24,7.53" target="#b62">Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,465.21,120.30,97.38,7.53" target="#b70">Robinson &amp; Brown, 2004)</ref> have identified various causes of psychological contract breach. For example, reneging occurs when the organization knowingly fails to meet an exchange obligation. Incongruence occurs when employees and organizations have different understandings about whether an obligation exists or about the nature of obligations. Reneging and incongruence lead to discrepancies between an employees' understanding of what was promised and their perception of what has been experienced. Once a breach has occurred, employees enter into a sensemaking process that determines their response <ref type="bibr" coords="2,347.53,224.88,109.67,7.54" target="#b62">(Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,459.71,224.88,57.47,7.53" target="#b69">Robinson 1996)</ref>. Responses may include feelings of betrayal, anger, and resentment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,522.31,235.32,40.29,7.53;2,311.53,245.81,22.03,7.53" target="#b76">(Rousseau, 1989)</ref> as well as attitudinal and behavioral reactions such as reductions in commitment and productivity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,460.39,256.24,67.14,7.53" target="#b91">(Zhao et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>

Consistent with previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.18,465.46,55.09,7.53" target="#b19">Colquitt, 2001)</ref>, we focus on procedural justice as a perceptual phenomenon to which employees respond.</p></div>

General political behavior is associated with employee perceptions of their co-workers engaging in political activities (e.g., backstabbing). Going along to get ahead represents influence tactics such as ingratiating oneself by agreeing with those in power. Pay and promotion refers to the extent that politics influence human resources functions. As a whole, the three dimensions describe how political a given workplace is perceived to be.</p></div>

Thus, organizational politics represents perceptions of a set of behaviors that are motivated by the self-interest of actors, whereas procedural justice is more closely associated with the structural features of decision-making that facilitate employee voice, appropriateness of criteria, and the accuracy of information used to make decisions <ref type="bibr" coords="3,234.07,308.59,49.67,7.53;3,32.71,319.02,80.96,7.53" target="#b25">(Cropanzano, Prehar, &amp; Chen, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical evidence also supports the uniqueness of politics and procedural justice perceptions.

Providing further evidence for discriminant validity, the authors found that five (i.e., locus of control, formalization, LMX, cooperation, and role conflict) of six measured antecedents distinguished between politics and procedural justice.

In particular, these three constructs are each, in some way, associated with employees' perceptions of their organizational exchange relationship. However, psychological contract breach reflects employees' perceptions that the organization has not fulfilled obligations that it has promised to employees. This notion of promised obligations is unique to the psychological contract and separates it from the other constructs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,98.19,549.16,63.01,7.53" target="#b69">(Robinson, 1996)</ref>. While there may be instances when organizations promise that decision making procedures will be fair and that politics will not influence work outcomes, these aspects of employment are more closely aligned with employees' general expectations of how they will be treated by their organizations, as opposed to implied or explicit promises made to employees. Thus, taken together, research and theory provide evidence that organizational politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach are related, yet distinguishable constructs. The focus of the current research is on understanding the ways in which these constructs relate to each other.</p><p>Relationships among psychological contract breach, justice, and politics Some researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,136.00,716.36,65.29,7.53" target="#b37">Hall et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,204.71,716.36,79.06,7.53;3,32.70,726.79,50.72,7.53">Tekleab, Takeushi, &amp; Taylor, 2005)</ref> suggest that politics and justice have direct effects on psychological contract breach. Yet others, particularly psychological contract theorists (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,146.77,747.77,102.67,7.53" target="#b72">Robinson &amp; Morrison, 2000)</ref>, suggest that fairness-related information moderates the effects of psychological contract breach. Adding to the confusion, cognitive consistency theory suggests that psychological contract breach has direct effects on perceptions of politics and procedural justice <ref type="bibr" coords="3,301.71,109.86,70.17,7.53" target="#b36">(Greenwald, 1980)</ref>. Furthermore, there are plausible arguments for considering politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach as indicators of a higher order factor that reflects general evaluations of the (un)fairness of employee-organization exchange relationships. These competing perspectives, which are illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="3,353.18,162.13,31.45,7.53" target="#fig_0">Figs. 1-4</ref>, are reviewed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model 1: Sensemaking-input model</head><p>The sensemaking-input model of psychological contract breach suggests that politics and justice moderate the effects of psychological contract breach on employee reactions (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,483.65,224.88,18.60,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). This model is consistent with the view that fairness-related information impacts sensemaking processes that follow a perceived psychological contract breach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.71,256.24,113.08,7.53" target="#b62">Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,507.39,256.24,45.33,7.53;3,301.72,266.73,58.36,7.53" target="#b72">Robinson &amp; Morrison, 2000)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,416.69,266.73,115.27,7.53" target="#b62">Morrison and Robinson (1997)</ref> posit that ''in cases where an employee can identify formal procedures that resulted in the breach of contract, feelings of violation will be influenced by factors that are known to influence judgments of procedural fairness" (p. 245). In other words, the strength of emotional and behavioral reactions to a contract breach is moderated by cognitive assessments of the context in which the breach occurred. If the organization has acted in a procedurally fair manner and has constrained interpersonal influences on decision-making in the past, then individuals are less likely to hold the organization at fault <ref type="bibr" coords="3,384.32,371.34,151.94,7.53" target="#b49">(Kickul, Neuman, Parker, &amp; Finkl, 2001)</ref>. As such, contract breach in a fair and apolitical context will elicit weaker affective and behavioral responses.</p><p>To our knowledge, no published studies have examined the moderating effects of organizational politics on relationships between psychological contract breach and its outcomes. However, there is evidence that perceived fairness has an impact on the relationship between psychological contract breach and employee reactions. In a longitudinal study, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,434.72,455.02,118.06,7.53" target="#b72">Robinson and Morrison (2000)</ref> found that perceived breach was associated with more intense feelings of violation when employees attributed the breach to purposeful reneging by a procedurally unfair employer. In another study, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,327.34,496.87,72.75,7.53" target="#b49">Kickul et al. (2001)</ref> found a three-way interaction between contract breach, interactional justice, and procedural justice. The results of this study demonstrated that the relationship between perceived contract breach and negative work behaviors was strongest when both procedural and interpersonal fairness were low. In line with these findings, the sensemaking-input model ( <ref type="figure" coords="3,510.38,549.14,22.51,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1)</ref> indicates that procedural justice and organizational politics moderate the effects of psychological contract breach on employee outcomes. We expect that effects are strongest when justice is low and politics is high.</p></div>

One way that people maintain cognitive consistency is by seeking out, attending to, and interpreting environmental information in a way that reinforces existing cognitions. For example, confirmation biases in information processing have been observed,  such that individuals favor and pay more attention to evidence that is consistent with their existing decision or attitudes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,32.71,525.53,60.31,7.53" target="#b42">Johnston, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,96.21,525.53,162.22,7.53" target="#b44">Jonas, Schulz-Hardt, Frey, &amp; Thelen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,261.62,525.53,17.73,7.53;5,32.71,536.02,79.17,7.53" target="#b59">Lundgren &amp; Prislin, 1998)</ref>.

For example, once a breach is perceived, confirmation bias may lead people to seek out additional information that confirms their beliefs that the organization is not a good exchange partner <ref type="bibr" coords="5,153.71,703.39,96.49,7.53" target="#b27">(Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,254.57,703.39,29.23,7.53;5,32.72,713.82,49.47,7.53" target="#b32">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1984)</ref>. High levels of organizational politics convey that the organization may not be able to meet certain exchange obligations (e.g., rewarding employees for performance), as managers in political work contexts tend to skirt the formal reward system when making allocation decisions <ref type="bibr" coords="5,433.65,504.63,64.29,7.53" target="#b37">(Hall et al., 2004)</ref>. Additionally, low procedural justice signals that organizations do not value their employees, which is consistent with beliefs associated with psychological contract breach. Therefore, selective attention may bias employees to perceive, encode, and recall more instances of politics and procedural injustice in organizations that have, in general, failed to fulfill their promises. Thus, based on cognitive consistency theory, following a psychological contract breach, employees will perceive that their organizations are political and that decision-making processes are unfair, which in turn mediate the effects of psychological contract breach on employee attitudes and behavior (see <ref type="figure" coords="5,410.36,619.73,19.45,7.53" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>Model 3: Environmental responsiveness model <ref type="figure" coords="5,313.36,661.57,23.03,7.53" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> presents an environmental responsiveness model in which psychological contract breach mediates the effects of politics and procedural justice on work outcomes.

At the core of SIP theory is the fundamental premise that the social context in which work-life is embedded provides cues that employees use to construct and interpret reality. Thus, in addition to perceiving and reacting to an objective workplace reality, employees also respond to a reality that is partially con- structed from social contextual information, such as information communicated by coworkers, observations of coworkers' behavior, and interactions with agents of the organization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,224.88,433.91,68.72,7.53;6,42.52,444.34,19.99,7.53" target="#b83">(Thomas &amp; Griffin, 1983)</ref>. When the social context is highly political, it creates an impression that the organization is incapable of meeting its exchange obligations because organizational agents are believed to be preoccupied with protecting their own self interests and accumulating power, often without concern for how their behaviors impact other members <ref type="bibr" coords="6,136.56,496.68,68.45,7.53" target="#b37">(Hall et al., 2004)</ref>. Thus, employees are more likely to formulate general impressions that their exchange obligations have been overlooked or unmet. Organizational politics also weaken performance-reward linkages <ref type="bibr" coords="6,217.69,528.03,75.88,7.53;6,42.52,538.52,19.92,7.53" target="#b22">(Cropanzano et al., 1997)</ref>, which signals that organizations are incapable or unwilling to meet their exchange obligations. In both cases, perceived politics has a negative impact on employees' evaluations of the extent to which organizations fulfill their promised obligations, which leads to a greater likelihood of perceiving psychological contract breach <ref type="bibr" coords="6,70.64,590.80,108.08,7.53" target="#b62">(Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Similar to politics, unfairness information paints an unflattering picture of the social context of organizations.

However, similarities between perceived politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach support a fourth way of specifying how these constructs are related. In particular, each of these constructs is linked to an evaluation of the fairness of different aspects of the employee-organization exchange relationship. Perceived politics is associated with an evaluation of whether the organization is willing to tolerate certain behaviors (i.e., those of a self-serving nature) in the social arena <ref type="bibr" coords="6,466.11,643.16,71.64,7.53" target="#b5">(Aryee et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,540.09,643.16,22.49,7.53;6,311.52,653.59,44.28,7.53" target="#b74">Rosen et al., 2006)</ref>.

Psychological contract breach is related to perceptions that the organization has failed to meet its obligations to employees and such perceptions are closely linked to feelings of unfairness, as the psychological contract serves to ''define the standards upon which justice is predicated" (Cropanzano &amp; Prehar, 2001, p. 246). Finally, procedural justice is linked to an evaluation of an organization's formal structures that contribute to fair decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" coords="7,122.28,93.47,96.35,7.53" target="#b82">(Thibaut &amp; Walker, 1975)</ref>.

For procedure justice and psychological contract breach items, we first conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) separately to evaluate the presence of secondary factor. Following the isolated uniqueness strategy recommended by <ref type="bibr" coords="8,225.47,88.88,64.24,7.53" target="#b38">Hall et al. (1999)</ref>, items that shared variance associated with the secondary factor (e.g., negative wording, similar stem) were used to form multi-item parcels. This strategy guided us to use three indicators for procedural justice and two for psychological contract breach.</p><p>Confirmatory and structural analyses were estimated using Mplus 4.0 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,85.04,151.64,103.33,7.53" target="#b63">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2006)</ref> with maximum likelihood estimation. With the exception of the sensemaking-input model, model fit was assessed using <ref type="bibr" coords="8,153.87,172.57,90.15,7.53" target="#b40">Hu and Bentler's (1999)</ref> 2-index presentation strategy, with the following cutoff values: values greater than .90 for the Comparative Fit (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis (TLI) indices, .06 or below for the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and .09 or below for the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Unfortunately, traditional fit indices are not yet available for assessing interactions between latent constructs with multiple indicators. Therefore, we followed <ref type="bibr" coords="8,227.17,245.82,66.46,7.53" target="#b64">Muthén's (2004)</ref> recommendations and compared adjacent nested models using loglikelihood difference chi-square tests to assess the sensemaking-input model. This method allows us to evaluate whether adding a path linking the interaction term between the predictor (i.e., contract breach) and the moderator (i.e., perceived politics or procedural justice) to the outcome (i.e., employee attitudes) improves model fit. In addition, because it is not possible to test the implied three-way interaction of contract breach, politics, and procedural justice on employee attitudes using Mplus, we used moderated regression analysis to examine higher-order moderation effects.</p></div>

This model fit the data well (v 2 (7) = 29.50, CFI = .97, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .10, SRMR = .04), indicating that it is appropriate to test moderation effects. Next, we examined politics perceptions as a moderator. The comparison of the adjacent nested model showed that adding the path did not significantly improve model fit <ref type="bibr" coords="8,488.74,277.16,15.28,7.53;8,504.06,275.59,3.48,5.02">(Dv 2</ref> (1) = 0.60), and the interaction term between contract breach and politics (b = .07) was not significant.

Finally, moderated regression analysis showed that, after controlling for main effects and all possible twoway interactions, the three-way interaction between contract breach, politics perceptions, and procedural justice was not a significant predictor of either of the two indicators of the employee attitudes factor (job satisfaction: b = .00; affective commitment: b = .05). Together, these results suggest that the effect of contract breach on general employee attitudes was not moderated by either politics perceptions or procedural justice, providing little support for the sensemaking-input model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p>Data were collected across two time periods spaced approximately three months apart. Employed students from a large, Midwestern university participated in this study for course credit. Four hundred and thirty-five students completed the survey at time 1.

Sixty-one percent of participants completed the survey at time 2, resulting in two hundred and sixty-five matched surveys for analysis. The average age of participants was 22 years old (SD = 5.12) and females made up 71% of the sample. Approximately 86% of the sample identified themselves as Caucasian, 6% identified themselves as African American, and 8% identified themselves as Asian, Hispanic, Native American, or Other.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p>Organizational scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="12,437.67,153.40,99.92,7.53" target="#b70">Robinson &amp; Brown, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,541.18,153.40,21.38,7.53;12,311.53,163.83,44.48,7.53" target="#b79">Shore et al., 2004)</ref> have suggested that relationships exist between organizational contexts and employee-organizational exchanges. However, empirical and theoretical research has not clarified how employees' perceptions of the organizational context affect evaluations of the psychological contract. The goal of our research was to specify how two aspects of the organizational context-organizational politics and procedural justice-relate to psychological contract judgments and subsequent work attitudes and behaviors. Toward this end, we identified four theoretical perspectives that specify different patterns of relationships among these constructs and, across three studies, assessed the appropriateness of each model.</p><p>Study 1 results provided little support for interaction effects of psychological contract breach with politics and justice. Thus, the sensemaking approach <ref type="bibr" coords="12,402.35,310.28,112.64,7.53" target="#b62">(Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,518.40,310.28,44.14,7.53;12,311.53,320.77,61.26,7.53" target="#b72">Robinson &amp; Morrison, 2000)</ref> for understanding relationships between organizational context and psychological contract breach received minimal support. Results of Study 1 were, however, consistent with predictions generated by the other three hypothesized models, supporting both mediational models (where psychological contract breach is specified as an antecedent or outcome of perceptions of politics and procedural justice) and the general (un)fairness evaluation model. Regarding the mediational models, the longitudinal design of Study 2 permitted us to utilize a cross-lagged panel analysis to assess how politics, justice, and psychological contract breach relate to each other over time. Results demonstrated that politics and justice are antecedents of psychological contract breach perceptions and not vice versa. The crosslagged panel results therefore supported the environmental responsiveness model, which specifies that organizational politics and procedural injustice lead employees to feel that a discrepancy exists between what they were promised by their organizations and what they actually received.</p><p>Study 3 replicated and extended the findings from Studies 1 and 2. Specifically, results were consistent with the environmental responsiveness and general (un)fairness evaluation models. Together, the set of studies suggests that (a) evaluations of psychological contract breach are a conduit, rather than a precipitating event, that links perceptions of the work context to attitudes and behaviors and (b) it may be appropriate to view organizational politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach as indicators of a broad evaluation of the fairness of the work context. Implications of these findings are discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and practical implications</head><p>In general terms, our findings offer a response to researchers' (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="12,332.96,655.52,92.22,7.53" target="#b56">Levy &amp; Williams, 2004)</ref> calls to focus attention on understanding how aspects of the organizational context shape organizational phenomena, including employee-organization exchange relationships <ref type="bibr" coords="12,364.48,686.93,74.33,7.53" target="#b79">(Shore et al., 2004)</ref>. This is important because, to date, organizational scholars have focused primarily on the content of psychological contracts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="12,430.98,707.85,94.43,7.53" target="#b26">Dabos &amp; Rousseau, 2004;</ref> and behavioral and attitudinal outcomes of psychological contract breach (see <ref type="bibr" coords="12,404.84,728.77,62.41,7.53" target="#b91">Zhao et al., 2007)</ref>, with little research pertaining to how contextual features relate to psychological contract breach evaluations. As noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="13,160.72,67.96,100.60,7.53">Shore et al. (2004, p. 323)</ref>, ''we know relatively little in a systematic way about which context factors-such as organizational stresses, group and organizational norms and culture, employee personal circumstances-are most critical [to the employee-organization exchange relationship]" and ''we lack solid knowledge about how such factors impact the ongoing exchange interactions between the two parties."</p><p>The present research addresses these concerns by systematically examining how specific information from organizational settings relates to employees' perceptions of psychological contract breach and subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Across multiple studies, our research demonstrated that organizational politics and procedural justice represent contextual information that employees consider when forming general (i.e., fairness) and specific (i.e., psychological contract evaluations) evaluative judgments. While there are valid arguments for considering a variety of processes through which the organizational context relates to psychological contracts (e.g., sensemaking and selective attention), our findings that were supportive of the environmental responsiveness model indicate that the SIP perspective <ref type="bibr" coords="13,213.67,266.74,70.15,7.53;13,32.72,277.17,22.03,7.53" target="#b78">(Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978)</ref> is most appropriate for explaining how, over time, politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach are related to each other and subsequent employee actions and reactions. In particular, Studies 1, 2, and 3 provide evidence that perceived politics and procedural justice each have unique (i.e., nonredundant) effects on psychological contract breach, which mediates the effects of politics and justice on general work attitudes and contextual performance. Furthermore, our results indicated that, in addition to psychological contract breach evaluations, these contextual variables may have other permeating effects on general work attitudes. This is evident in the partial mediation effects of procedural justice demonstrated across these studies.</p><p>Thus, consistent with previous literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,239.14,402.71,44.59,7.53;13,32.72,413.19,52.09,7.53" target="#b4">Andrews &amp; Kacmar, 2001)</ref>, we provide further evidence supporting the distinctiveness of these constructs. Nonetheless, it is necessary to continue studying both constructs in order to better understand how they relate to each other and to employees' assessments of their work context. For example, there may be other mechanisms through which these contextual factors influence employee attitudes and performance. Specifically, emotional strain has been identified as a possible mediator linking perceived politics with job satisfaction and organizational commitment, as well as performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,106.54,507.31,133.45,7.53" target="#b66">Podsakoff, LePine, &amp; LePine, 2007)</ref>. Similarly, procedural unfairness has been linked with increased negative emotions such as anxiety and frustration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,239.70,528.24,44.09,7.53;13,32.72,538.72,68.43,7.53" target="#b52">Krehbiel &amp; Cropanzano, 2000)</ref>, which may in turn lead to reduced satisfaction, commitment, and performance.</p><p>The results supporting the general (un)fairness evaluation model are also quite interesting. In particular, the relative fit of the unified, general (un)fairness model, where politics, justice, and psychological contract breach load on a single factor, is comparable to the environmental responsiveness model. Moreover, the magnitude of the relationship between the general (un)fairness construct and employee attitudes (b = À.91) suggests that the common relationship between politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach may be a primary source of variance in work attitudes. These findings support <ref type="bibr" coords="13,145.77,653.82,104.22,7.53" target="#b0">Ajzen and Fishbein's (1977)</ref> compatibility principal by showing that when perceptions and attitudes are examined at similar levels of abstraction, they demonstrate the strongest relationships with one another.</p><p>The environmental responsiveness and general (un)fairness models are not incompatible, as both suggest that perceptions politics, justice, and psychological contract breach represent evaluative tendencies that are relevant to work attitudes and behaviors. However, the current research does raise important questions concerning the measurement and modeling of the focal constructs and has implications for how future researchers examine constructs, such as politics, justice and psychological contract breach, that have developed independently, yet share a common underlying theme. First and foremost, the way in which constructs are modeled should be guided by the goals of specific studies. If researchers are interested in forecasting (i.e., determining what generally predicts work attitudes and behaviors), then it may be most appropriate to examine constructs that are of a more general nature, such as global fairness evaluations, core-self evaluations <ref type="bibr" coords="13,500.60,151.71,52.18,7.53;13,301.73,162.14,64.41,7.53" target="#b45">(Judge, Locke, &amp; Durham, 1997)</ref>, and hindrance and challenge stressors (LePine, <ref type="bibr" coords="13,301.73,172.63,107.66,7.53">Podsakoff, &amp; LePine, 2005)</ref>. Second, our results suggest that researchers should match the level of abstraction of perceptual variables with the same level of generality/specificity as criterion variables. Thus, our research indicates that examining how specific aspects of the organizational social context relate to general employee attitudes (and vice versa) may not be appropriate. Finally, our findings also suggest that researchers who wish to develop a finer grained understanding of the underlying psychological processes that lead to attitude formation and behavior activation will benefit from taking a disaggregated <ref type="bibr" coords="13,445.54,266.73,103.20,7.53" target="#b7">(Bagozzi &amp; Edwards, 1998)</ref>, diversified approach that, in the case of politics, justice, and psychological contract breach, makes use of longitudinal research designs to examine how work perceptions relate to each other, work attitudes, and behaviors. Such an approach will aid researchers who are interested in identifying multiple points at which to target organizational interventions.</p><p>In particular, results supporting the environmental responsiveness model indicate that separate interventions aimed at reducing politics and enhancing procedural justice may be necessary. In particular, organizational politics are representative of self-serving behaviors that influence social, interpersonal aspects of the work environment. In contrast, procedural justice is associated with structural features of decision-making that organizations may have greater control over. Thus, organizations that intend to improve their members' evaluations of the psychological contract may need to consider both aspects, as politics and procedural justice are independently relevant to employees' evaluations of their psychological contracts and ensuing attitudes and behaviors. Not only should there be transparent and consistent policies and procedures in place that are clearly communicated to employees, but organizations must also discourage the practice of politicking. This could be accomplished by incorporating politics-based competencies into performance management programs that align employee and organizational goals <ref type="bibr" coords="13,362.83,517.79,82.86,7.53">(Chang et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,447.76,517.79,41.07,7.53" target="#b89">Witt, 1998)</ref>. This two-prong approach to increasing procedural fairness and reducing organizational politics may result in substantial improvements in employees' psychological contract evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>A majority of the participants in our samples were employed university students. The reliance on a younger sample of subordinates with modest job tenure may place boundary conditions on the generalizability of the study. This is especially relevant because it has been found that employees with shorter tenure show a proclivity for perceiving that the organization has failed to fulfill its obligations to them <ref type="bibr" coords="13,379.90,653.81,90.63,7.53" target="#b80">(Sutton &amp; Griffin, 2004)</ref> and that age moderates reactions to politics <ref type="bibr" coords="13,397.41,664.24,120.41,7.53" target="#b90">(Witt, Treadway, &amp; Ferris, 2004)</ref>. Thus, it would be worthwhile to replicate our findings with samples comprised of employees with greater variance in age, tenure, and career stage. However, one advantage of our samples is that subordinates were from a variety of organizations (and thus differing social contexts) which is encouraging with respect to the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>A second limitation pertains to the use of self-report data. Any time that self-reported data are used, common method variance (CMV) may bias the observed relationships among variables. CMV may have accounted for some of the variance in subordinate responses in Study 1 when self-reported data were collected at a single point in time. We attempted to reduce the threat of CMV by gathering data over multiple time periods in Study 2 and including supervisor ratings of performance criteria in Study 3 (see <ref type="bibr" coords="14,61.85,130.72,180.34,7.53" target="#b67">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003)</ref>. The results were consistent across all three studies, which suggests that CMV is likely not a threat to the validity of our findings.</p><p>Although the results of the present study highlight the relevance of politics and justice, other contextual variables may also be important to consider. Such variables may include perceived support, other dimensions of fairness besides procedural justice, the feedback environment, and an organization's hierarchical structure. Future studies may extend our findings by evaluating additional micro (e.g., perceived organizational support, leadermember exchange relationships, feedback and communication processes) and macro (e.g., the employment market, the economy, type of industry) features of jobs that might influence employees' evaluations of their psychological contracts <ref type="bibr" coords="14,210.79,266.74,70.41,7.53" target="#b79">(Shore et al., 2004)</ref>. It would also be worthwhile to examine boundary conditions of observed relationships by focusing on situational and personal characteristics that moderate the effects of politics and justice on perceptions of the psychological contract. For example, research has demonstrated that equity sensitivity may amplify the effects of injustice on employee reactions <ref type="bibr" coords="14,176.01,329.51,117.57,7.53;14,42.52,339.94,19.77,7.53" target="#b20">(Colquitt, Scott, Judge, &amp; Shaw, 2006)</ref>, whereas political skill has the potential to mitigate the relationship between perceived organizational politics and adverse employee reactions <ref type="bibr" coords="14,119.04,360.86,114.76,7.53" target="#b75">(Rosen, Levy, &amp; Johnson, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned above, there may be additional mediating factors that link these contextual characteristics with employee attitudes and behavior. Emotional strain represents one such variable. Thus, future research should explore whether strain, along with psychological contract breach, mediate the effects of perceived politics and procedural justice on employee outcomes. Additionally, future studies should longitudinally assess the effects of politics and justice on the sources of psychological contract breach (e.g., reneging, incongruence). Doing so would improve our understanding of how relationships between the organizational context and psychological contract breach unfold over time and may provide additional clarification for why politics and injustice affect evaluations of the psychological contract.</p><p>Finally, future research is necessary to explore the nature of the general fairness construct that was supported by Studies 1 and 3. In particular, researchers should seek to determine which aspects of politics, justice, and psychological contract breach are shared (e.g., evaluative tendencies, linkages to the social exchange relationship, associations with fairness in the workplace) and explore why this common relationship is of such great importance to work attitudes. Moreover, our findings imply that researchers who are interested in understanding psychological processes and relationships among specific perceptual constructs need to focus on improving how various constructs are measured. In the case of politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach, we suggest that researchers focus on assessing unique, non-overlapping aspects of each. Such an approach will improve the contribution of these constructs to the organizational sciences and will serve to reduce redundancy in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The current study examined how organizational politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach relate to each other as well as work attitudes and behaviors. Across three studies, our results support the perspective that general evaluations of the psychological contract are influenced by employees' perceptions of politics and procedural justice. However, our research did not allow us to rule out an alternative, second-order model in which organizational politics, procedural justice, and psychological contract breach share a common relationship with general evaluations of fairness of the work context and this shared relationship appears to be fundamentally important to understanding work attitudes. These findings have important implications for the measurement and modeling of psychological contract breach, justice, and politics in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,250.92,393.81,103.24,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Sensemaking-input model.</figDesc></figure>
