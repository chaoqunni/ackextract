This research was supported by a University of Cologne Advanced Postdoc Grant to Roland Imhoff. We are greatly indebted to Ron Dotsch â€“ the idea for this research was born over a joint lunch half way between Nijmegen and Cologne. Ron, you will be greatly missed in academia! We would also like to thank Maike Hermann, Anna Monschau and Felix Zimmer for help with Study 4. All materials, data and code are available under https://osf.io/4rmnv.
