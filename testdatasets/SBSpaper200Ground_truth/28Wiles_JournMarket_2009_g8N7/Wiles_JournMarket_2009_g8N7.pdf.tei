			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As a result of the diminishing effectiveness of broadcast advertising, firms are increasingly turning to product placements in films and television to promote their products. A growing stream of product placement research has conducted surveys of consumer and practitioner views on the practice and experiments to gauge product placement's impact on brand awareness, attitudes, and purchase intent. However, there is no evidence of whether firms' investments in film product placements are worthwhile. The event study of 126 product placements in successful films during 2002 reveals a mean cumulative abnormal return of .89% during the film's opening, indicating that product placement in a successful film is associated with positive movements in firm stock prices. Cross-sectional analysis of the returns offers new insight into how product, film, and execution factors influence the placement's worth. The authors find that placement abnormal returns are enhanced by tie-in advertising and brand equity but are inhibited by audience absorption, critical acclaim, and violent film content. Placement modality, character associations, and blatancy also significantly affect the placement's value.</p></div>

To address this important knowledge gap, this article addresses the fundamental question of the economic worth of placement in films.</p><p>We investigate the worth of product placements in films through an event study. Event studies are commonly used to assess the returns to a marketing action because it is extremely difficult to control for all the other concomitant factors that influence firm revenue and profits <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.55,82.21,44.46,8.79;2,54.00,93.71,125.64,8.79" target="#b42">(Geyskens, Gielens, and Dekimpe 2002)</ref>. Event studies allow the event's unique contribution to the firm's future profit performance to be isolated and measured <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.23,116.71,82.77,8.79;2,54.00,128.21,21.52,8.79" target="#b54">(Hyman and Mathur 2005)</ref>. Examining the highest-grossing movies in 2002, we show that product placements in successful films are associated with abnormal returns for shareholders. This provides the first empirical evidence to support the value of film product placement. In addition, we advance theoretical understanding by constructing a comprehensive model of the product and program factors that affect film placement worth, and we test this model using a cross-sectional analysis of the abnormal returns. This provides important new insights into which placement strategies maximize shareholder value.</p><p>We organize the remainder of the article as follows: After reviewing the gaps that hinder our understanding of the returns to product placements in successful films, we integrate theory on the marketing-finance interface with insights from the advertising response and media effects literature streams to develop hypotheses on how product and film factors affect placement worth. We then review our data collection, and after presenting the results of the event study and the cross-sectional analysis, we discuss our findings. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>Considerable research indicates that firms' advertising and marketing communication decisions have strong influences on firms' stock prices. One perspective holds that advertising indicates the availability of discretionary firm resources and firm financial solvency <ref type="bibr" coords="2,168.47,461.13,121.22,8.79" target="#b36">(Erickson and Jacobson 1992)</ref>, but spending on advertising is more commonly viewed as an investment in intangible firm assets, shaping the prospective size and vulnerability of the firm's future cash flows <ref type="bibr" coords="2,79.77,507.13,159.62,8.79" target="#b92">(Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998)</ref>. Advertising is also believed to raise the firm's capital market visibility, which can broaden the firm's investor base, improve liquidity, and lower the firm's systematic risk and cost of capital <ref type="bibr" coords="2,54.00,553.13,148.19,8.79" target="#b48">(Grullon, Kanatas, and Weston 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,204.66,553.13,89.33,8.79;2,54.00,564.63,64.34,8.79" target="#b73">McAlister, Srinivasan, and Kim 2007)</ref>. Studies of firms' aggregate advertising expenditures have found that increased levels of advertising and related brand-building activities are associated with enhanced cash flows and market values <ref type="bibr" coords="2,224.58,599.13,69.41,8.79;2,54.00,610.63,76.98,8.79" target="#b20">(Conchar, Crask, and Zinkhan 2005)</ref>. However, the returns to individual ad campaigns are more variable <ref type="bibr" coords="2,186.64,622.13,107.37,8.79;2,54.00,633.63,22.78,8.79" target="#b1">(Agrawal and Kamakura 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,79.35,633.63,70.03,8.79" target="#b94">Tellis et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,151.83,633.63,47.20,8.79" target="#b100">Wiles 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Evidence that alternative ways of enhancing product exposure are worthwhile is still emerging. The results from event studies suggest that major-league sports and Olympic sponsorships enhance firms' stock prices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.29,679.63,39.71,8.79;2,54.00,691.13,90.80,8.79" target="#b22">Cornwell, Pruitt, and Clark 2005)</ref>, but the wisdom of less salient communication alternatives, such as product placement, remains unclear. Investors' judgments of the worth of a firm's mar-keting action are conditioned by the action's perceived consumer impact <ref type="bibr" coords="2,379.41,47.71,110.57,8.79" target="#b62">(Lane and Jacobson 1995)</ref>. Therefore, the economic return to product placement in successful films is inextricably connected to the placement's expected effects on consumers.</p><p>Scholars have primarily pointed to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,475.27,93.71,82.73,8.79" target="#b74">McCracken's (1989)</ref> meaning-transfer model as a mechanism that can explain consumers' response to placements. McCracken suggests that the use of celebrity endorsers is effective because celebrities are endowed with symbolic meaning that is passed on to the product through its association with the celebrity. In much the same way, popular entertainment has rich symbolic meaning that can be transferred to the placed product <ref type="bibr" coords="2,351.81,185.71,57.56,8.79" target="#b85">(Russell 2002)</ref>. Consumers connect the film world to their own, mapping their aspirations onto the products placed in the film (DeLorme and Reid 1999), which in turn influences attitudes and consumption norms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,496.16,220.21,61.84,8.79;2,318.00,231.71,43.48,8.79">(Pechmann and Shih 1999)</ref>. For these reasons, film and television product placements have been found to enhance brand awareness, attitudes, and purchase intent (e.g., D'Astous and Chartier 2000; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,344.63,266.21,54.82,8.79" target="#b85">Russell 2002)</ref>. Prominent placements capture attention and enhance these intermediate consumer outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,342.15,289.21,91.49,8.79" target="#b49">Gupta and Lord 1998)</ref>, but the enhancing effects of other execution factors, such as modality and plot connection, have received less consistent support <ref type="bibr" coords="2,491.88,312.21,66.11,8.79;2,318.00,323.71,22.78,8.79" target="#b63">(Law and Braun 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,344.51,323.71,54.70,8.79" target="#b85">Russell 2002)</ref>, clouding knowledge of which placements are valuable.</p><p>Therefore, our review suggests that several gaps remain in the understanding of film product placement. Because there is no direct evidence connecting film placement to increases in firm cash flows and stock price performance, it remains unclear whether film placement is indeed a wise practice. Prior placement research has also paid little attention to how film characteristics affect placement outcomes. This oversight is surprising, given the substantial literature on how program factors affect ad effectiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="2,521.91,438.71,36.10,8.79;2,318.00,450.21,74.09,8.79" target="#b39">(Feltham and Arnold 1994)</ref>. Because it is also not apparent how product-level factors affect placement value and because prior research has not simultaneously controlled for each of the different execution dimensions, firms have little knowledge about which placement opportunities to pursue. Thus, there is a need for research that can discern the worth of film placement and that considers simultaneously the effects of product, film, and execution factors. Our event study approach is uniquely suited to filling this gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Framework</head><p>Film placement worth is derived from the placement's ability to influence shareholder value positively, and there are several hypotheses that can offer a credible mechanism by which product placement information affects investor decisions. First, the price pressure hypothesis states that public attention <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.81,645.13,112.69,8.79" target="#b9">(Barber and Odean 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,477.71,645.13,66.54,8.79" target="#b79">Meschke 2004)</ref> or public mood and enthusiasm <ref type="bibr" coords="2,455.31,656.63,102.68,8.79;2,318.00,668.13,72.97,8.79" target="#b38">(Fehle, Tsyplakov, and Zdorovtsov 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,395.37,668.13,118.30,8.79" target="#b53">Huberman and Regev 2001)</ref> alone can move stock trading volume and prices. Second, the investor recognition hypothesis, originally developed by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,528.02,691.13,29.98,8.79;2,318.00,702.63,24.99,8.79" target="#b78">Merton (1987)</ref>, highlights the role of increased publicity and firm awareness on investor trading behavior. According to this view, increased visibility for a firm can draw investor attention, induce some of these investors to follow the firm, and motivate these investors to become new shareholders, thus leading to a greater ownership base of the stock and greater liquidity <ref type="bibr" coords="3,92.17,82.42,154.16,8.79" target="#b48">(Grullon, Kanatas, and Weston 2004)</ref>. Similarly, scholars have found that increased publicity for initial public offerings attracts additional retail investors to such offerings and enhances offer price valuations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,216.56,117.07,77.44,8.79;3,54.00,128.63,77.85,8.79">(Cook, Kieschnick, and Van Vess 2007)</ref>. Third, the investor sentiment hypothesis posits that sentimental investors may drive up the relative demand for shares of the firms that have the vector of principal characteristics that is compatible with their sentiment <ref type="bibr" coords="3,76.75,174.83,103.65,8.79" target="#b6">(Baker and Wurgler 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Perhaps more important, however, film placement information can also be expected to affect stock prices by directly changing investor expectations regarding the firm's future financial performance, and thus there would also likely be information-based trading in response to the film placement event. Because the firm's stock price reflects the discounted value of the firm's expected cash flows, marketing activities that accelerate and enhance future cash flows have the ability to affect shareholder value positively (i.e., the stock price effect) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,153.22,290.35,135.72,8.79;3,54.00,301.91,52.24,8.79" target="#b4">(Anderson, Fornell, and Mazvancheryl 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,110.73,301.91,96.05,8.79" target="#b47">Gruca and Rego 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,211.26,301.91,82.73,8.79;3,54.00,313.46,21.52,8.79" target="#b84">Rao and Bharadwaj 2008)</ref>. Financial markets are forward looking; thus, if the film placement has positive implications for the firm's prospects, the firm's market value will shift to reflect these anticipated changes in the firm's financial performance before these changes actually occur. By building intangible market-based assets, firm marketing actions have the potential to shape prospective cash flows and, thus, the firm's market value by (1) increasing cash flow levels, (2) accelerating cash flow timing, (3) reducing cash flow vulnerability, and (4) increasing the firm's residual value <ref type="bibr" coords="3,237.26,417.43,56.75,8.79;3,54.00,428.98,22.78,8.79" target="#b41">(Fornell et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,79.26,428.98,151.04,8.79" target="#b92">Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998)</ref>. Evidence suggests that film product placement can facilitate firm performance in each of these ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How Film Product Placement Positively Shapes Expected Future Cash Flows</head><p>First, there are strong reasons for investors to expect that film product placement enhances future cash flow levels. Ample evidence indicates that product placements increase consumer awareness and enhance brand attitudes (e.g., D'Astous and Chartier 2000; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.92,545.87,89.29,8.79" target="#b49">Gupta and Lord 1998)</ref>. Thus, film product placement has the potential to improve brand equity, and improvements in brand equity have long been associated with increased consumer demand and increases in cash flow levels <ref type="bibr" coords="3,133.93,592.08,91.57,8.79" target="#b0">(Aaker and Day 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.84,592.08,65.15,8.79;3,54.00,603.63,76.68,8.79" target="#b20">Conchar, Crask, and Zinkhan 2005)</ref>. Enhanced brand associations can also increase the perceived value of the firm's offering and improve customer satisfaction, further facilitating cash flows (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,101.39,638.29,90.34,8.79" target="#b47">Gruca and Rego 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,194.31,638.29,95.18,8.79;3,54.00,649.84,57.57,8.79">Rust, Zahorik, and Keiningham 1995)</ref>. For these reasons, strong links between brand enhancement and improvements in firm market value have often been observed <ref type="bibr" coords="3,160.19,672.94,110.74,8.79">(Aaker and Jacobson 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,274.00,672.94,19.99,8.79;3,54.00,684.50,78.12,8.79" target="#b62">Lane and Jacobson 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Second, film placements can enhance firm market values by accelerating the expected timing of the firm's cash flows. Placements have been found to increase purchase intent <ref type="bibr" coords="3,346.20,36.21,182.86,8.79" target="#b43">(Gould, Gupta, and Grabner-Krauter 2000)</ref>; thus, placements can lead to impulse purchases, which can accelerate the receipt of cash flows. A placement's ability to stimulate new product uses and applications may also further facilitate investors' expectations of firm cash flow timing. Placements are especially effective in encouraging new types of product consumption because placements are aspirational and can set consumption norms <ref type="bibr" coords="3,481.11,118.53,57.04,8.79" target="#b85">(Russell 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Third, film product placement has the potential to enhance firm market value by reducing the expected vulnerability of the firm's cash flows. Consumers' connections with films can create strong loyalty for the products in the film, creating substantial switching costs. Placements can also affect consumption trends and styles for years after the film's release <ref type="bibr" coords="3,375.97,200.84,47.42,8.79" target="#b103">(Yorks 1989</ref>). Ford's use of Steve McQueen in a 2005 Mustang commercial further suggests that film placements can be an enduring source of positive brand associations and equity.</p><p>Finally, film product placement can be expected to expand the firm's customer base, increasing the firm's residual value. The significant increase in sales of Red Stripe after The Firm and the Mini Cooper after The Italian Job is testament to the potential of film placement to attract new customers to brands. Moreover, film placements are an attractive way to target specific audiences, such as teenagers, and they allow firms to expose their products to consumers who would not normally pay attention to the brand. For example, Cadillac placed its cars in The Matrix Reloaded to reach a younger audience.</p><p>In summary, extensive theory and evidence suggest that investors should react positively to film placement. Placements should lead investors to develop positive expectations for future financial performance because placements can lead to improvements in brand associations and loyalty that can accelerate and enhance the firm's cash flows. For these reasons, we posit the following: H 1 : Film product placement is positively associated with a change in firm market value.</p><p>Following advertising response models (MacInnis and Jaworski 1989), we assert that the worth of a film product placement is related to product, film, and execution factors (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,340.30,527.33,36.45,8.79">Figure 1</ref>), which affect the likely consumer and investor response to the placement. Because of the ample research on the execution factors, we incorporate these factors into our framework as controls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product and Film Determinants of Placement Worth</head><p>Tie-in advertising. Tie-in advertising occurs when the firm promotes a product's appearance in a film before the film's release. First, a reason cash flow levels due to the placement are enhanced is that tie-in advertisements facilitate consumer processing of the placement. Prior exposure to a concept increases the concept's accessibility (i.e., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,539.67,672.11,13.75,8.79;3,318.00,683.87,81.54,8.79" target="#b51">Higgins and King 1981)</ref>, improving people's ability to identify the concept in visually complex environments. Therefore, tie-in advertisements increase the likelihood that consumers will notice the placement in the film.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controls</head><p>Second, placements supported by tie-in advertising campaigns are worth more because the tie-in campaign strengthens consumers' meaning transfer from the film to the product. Consumers are more likely to draw filmproduct connections because the advertising and its cost highlight the placement's significance to the firm. The expense and publicity of the tie-in campaign increase the placement's diagnosticity <ref type="bibr" coords="4,165.74,451.65,64.35,8.79" target="#b60">(Kirmani 1990)</ref>, elevating the importance of the placement in consumers' network of brand associations. Tie-in advertising may also create contextual priming effects <ref type="bibr" coords="4,151.88,486.15,38.55,8.79" target="#b101">(Yi 1993)</ref>, which further facilitate meaning transfer.</p><p>Third, the expenditure of financial and organizational resources on the tie-in advertising also signals the placement's strategic importance to the firm. The tie-in campaign indicates the priority that the firm places on leveraging its involvement with the film, suggesting that the firm considers the film's associations vital additions to the brand. Investors may also respond more favorably because of the potential communication synergies of the tie-in campaign.</p><p>In summary, tie-in advertising directs consumer attention to the placement and thus enhances film-product meaning transfer and bolsters film-product connections. For these reasons, we expect the following: H 2 : The worth of product placement in successful films is positively related to the presence of tie-in advertising.</p><p>Brand equity. Familiar, favorably regarded brands have high brand equity <ref type="bibr" coords="4,129.62,693.15,52.95,8.79" target="#b58">(Keller 1993)</ref>, and the returns from film product placement should be positively related to brand equity for three primary reasons. First, consumers' motiva-tion and ability to process the placement increase when the placement is for a strong, familiar brand rather than a weak, unfamiliar brand. Attention in cluttered visual environments focuses on objects with easily accessible attitudes, and consumers are more motivated to pay attention to advertisements for well-known brands <ref type="bibr" coords="4,447.38,428.65,51.84,8.79" target="#b94">(Tellis 1988)</ref>. As a result, advertisements for well-known brands enjoy higher levels of recall, and well-known brands are less affected by competitive inference <ref type="bibr" coords="4,409.09,463.15,90.77,8.79" target="#b59">(Kent and Allen 1994)</ref>. Thus, placements for high-equity brands are worth more because these brands draw attention, lengthening the opportunity for meaning transfer.</p><p>Second, evidence also indicates that brand equity may enhance the mapping process. Because of consistency concerns, positive information is weighed more heavily when the brand is familiar and well regarded <ref type="bibr" coords="4,483.59,543.65,70.10,8.79" target="#b2">(Ahluwalia 2002)</ref>. Thus, the mapping of the film onto the product occurs more easily for high-equity brands, enhancing the increases in demand and cash flows from the placement.</p><p>Third, placements for high-equity brands may convey more strategic information to financial markets. The highequity brand's high familiarity suggests that the primary intent of the placement is not merely to increase brand exposure but also to deepen and enhance brand associations. Therefore, investors are likely to infer greater strategic significance to these brand placements. For example, the placement of Mercedes in Men in Black II signified new emphasis on the fun of driving a Mercedes, a shift to enhance the brand's appeal with younger consumers. Thus, brand equity expands the returns from film placement because it leads to favorable consumer processing and to positive inferences about the brand's future strategic direction.</p><p>H 3 : The worth of product placement in successful films is positively related to brand equity.</p><p>Audience absorption. Theories from multiple research streams suggest that the level of audience absorption affects consumers' motivation and ability to attend to placements. Media processing models from psychology contend that people process the narratives in books and films by becoming absorbed in and transported into the story <ref type="bibr" coords="5,254.67,151.18,39.32,8.79;5,54.00,162.69,92.32,8.79" target="#b26">(Dal Cin, Zanna, and Fong 2004)</ref>. Absorption is a convergent process in which attention is focused on understanding the events in the narrative, leaving little motivation and ability for other tasks. People who are absorbed lose themselves in the story, thus limiting placement awareness.</p><p>The relationship between advertising effectiveness and program involvement suggests additional evidence for the inhibiting effect of absorption. Most of this research has examined the effects of program involvement in situations, such as radio and television commercials, in which the program and the advertisement are presented sequentially <ref type="bibr" coords="5,54.00,289.35,108.50,8.79" target="#b67">(Lord and Burnkrant 1993)</ref>. With placements, however, the entertainment and commercial messages are presented concurrently. When the advertisement is presented at the same time as the entertaining content, program involvement inhibits attention to the advertisements <ref type="bibr" coords="5,213.25,335.40,80.75,8.79;5,54.00,346.92,22.78,8.79" target="#b80">(Norris and Colman 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,79.02,346.92,93.30,8.79" target="#b99">Wang and Calder 2006)</ref>, thus limiting the opportunity for meaning transfer.</p><p>In summary, these streams converge on the idea that placements in absorbing films receive less favorable consumer processing. Therefore, investors should react less positively to placements in absorbing films.</p><p>H 4 : The worth of product placement in successful films is negatively related to film absorption.</p><p>Critical acclaim. Though counterintuitive, three arguments suggest that placements in critically acclaimed films are less valuable to the firm. First, evidence suggests that consumers become irritated when advertisements impede consumption goals <ref type="bibr" coords="5,134.98,496.44,119.49,8.79" target="#b31">(Edwards, Li, and Lee 2002)</ref>. Product placements in critically acclaimed films hinder consumers' attainment of their artistic consumption goals <ref type="bibr" coords="5,252.35,519.47,41.65,8.79;5,54.00,530.98,87.70,8.79" target="#b52">(Holbrook and Hirschman 1982)</ref> because the placements are commercial messages that disrupt their experience of the film. Thus, consumers become upset and angry when they encounter placements in critically praised films (DeLorme and Reid 1999), which dampens brand evaluations.</p><p>Second, because consumers expect the high art experience to be free from advertising persuasion tactics <ref type="bibr" coords="5,256.80,600.06,37.20,8.79;5,54.00,611.58,21.53,8.79" target="#b19">(Charters 2006)</ref>, the appearance of placements in acclaimed films may also disconfirm expectations. Disconfirmation leads to increased elaboration and lower evaluations of the discrepant product when the novelty is not appreciated (Campbell and Goodstein 2001). These negative reactions to the placement may be exacerbated if the artistic processing goals increase the irrelevance of the discrepancy, further lowering the placement's worth.</p><p>Third, there is growing consumer consciousness that certain public artistic goods need to be protected from advertising messages <ref type="bibr" coords="5,406.09,36.20,51.34,8.79" target="#b61">(Klein 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,460.46,36.20,97.53,8.79;5,318.00,47.81,21.52,8.79" target="#b77">Meenaghan and Shipley 1999)</ref>. Thus, consumers may react negatively to placements in acclaimed films because they believe that these films should be a protected area, free from marketing persuasion tactics. As such, consumers may perceive placements in acclaimed films as inappropriate, thus reducing their worth.</p><p>In summary, research streams on goal impediment, information expectancy, and marketing tactic appropriateness converge on the idea that consumers react less positively to placements in critically acclaimed films. Because consumer anger and annoyance with an advertising tactic are believed to reduce advertising effectiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="5,512.77,163.90,45.24,8.79;5,318.00,175.51,63.77,8.79" target="#b0">(Aaker and Bruzzone 1985)</ref>, we predict that investors consider placements in critically acclaimed films less valuable.</p><p>H 5 : The worth of product placement in successful films is negatively related to film critical acclaim.</p><p>Association with violence. There are two main reasons to suspect that violence in films diminishes placement worth. First, the literature on media violence contends that consumers react to violence in television and films with feelings of hostility, aggression, and anger <ref type="bibr" coords="5,515.49,277.39,42.50,8.79;5,318.00,289.00,21.52,8.79" target="#b17">(Bushman 2005)</ref>. These negative emotions and associations may be transferred to the placed product (McCracken 1989), thus attenuating placement value. For example, recent studies have found that advertisements embedded in violent television programs generate lower purchase intentions <ref type="bibr" coords="5,530.79,335.44,22.68,8.79;5,318.00,347.05,41.49,8.79" target="#b17">(Bushman 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The second reason film violence may diminish placement worth is related to the inferences consumers draw from the firm's involvement with the violent film. A product placement functions as an endorsement <ref type="bibr" coords="5,478.23,393.48,56.91,8.79" target="#b85">(Russell 1998)</ref>, so a placement suggests that the firm approves of the film's subject matter. If the firm disapproved of the film's content, it would not have placed the product in the film. For example, airlines refuse placements in films that depict flying in a negative manner. A product placement sends the message that the firm is not bothered by the film's violence, and thus consumers may lower their opinions of products placed in violent films because of their concerns about film violence and its negative impact on society <ref type="bibr" coords="5,458.00,497.96,100.00,8.79" target="#b16">(Brown and Dacin 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.00,509.57,109.65,8.79" target="#b87">Salwen and Dupagne 1999)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, we hypothesize that placement worth is negatively related to the level of violence in films. However, young men are less bothered by media violence <ref type="bibr" coords="5,516.89,544.40,41.10,8.79;5,318.00,556.01,21.52,8.79" target="#b50">(Hamilton 1998)</ref>. This suggests that products that are primarily targeted toward consumer segments that do not judge film violence negatively are less harmed by violent content. Although we make no formal prediction, we examine whether product type moderates the impact of violence. H 6 . The worth of product placement in successful films is negatively related to film violence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Event Study Methodology</head><p>We use the event study methodology to assess the impact of the event's unexpected information on the firm's stock price. The efficient market hypothesis asserts that a stock price reflects all public information about the firm, so only unexpected information can change the price of a stock <ref type="bibr" coords="6,54.00,59.21,67.53,8.79" target="#b37">(Fama et al. 1969</ref>). If the new information indicates that the firm will garner higher (lower) future cash flows, the firm's stock price rises (drops) in reaction to the new information. The stock's abnormal return-the difference between the expected returns based on general market movement and the actual returns-provides an unbiased estimate of the economic worth of the event <ref type="bibr" coords="6,180.82,128.21,108.88,8.79" target="#b15">(Brown and Warner 1980)</ref>. Excellent reviews of the market model approach for estimating abnormal returns have appeared recently in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="6,109.13,162.71,131.56,8.79" target="#b91">Srinivasan and Bharadwaj 2004)</ref>. We use the portfolio method to construct our test statistic due to our event date clustering <ref type="bibr" coords="6,143.81,185.71,48.18,8.79" target="#b56">(Jaffe 1974)</ref>, and we present details about this test in the Appendix. Information about the company's film placement is disseminated to the market when the film is released, as well as before the event, through firm promotional efforts. This firm publicity can cue investors to the placement-drawing attention to the film-but we assume that the information needed to change investors' beliefs about the firm's prospects is not available to investors until the film is shown. We validate this assumption in our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Because Hollywood studios release approximately 200 films each year, we limited our analysis to the most popular films, or the 31 movies in 2002 that made $20 million in the United States during their first weekend, according to Boxofficemojo.com.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable Operationalization</head><p>Our event is the appearance of a product in the released film and the circumstances of its appearance because information about how the product appears (placement execution) and the film context in which it appears (e.g., film violence, audience size) is not available until the film's release. A visual placement occurs if the product's name or logo is legibly shown on the screen, and an audio placement occurs if the product is mentioned <ref type="bibr" coords="6,168.62,497.21,57.67,8.79" target="#b85">(Russell 2002)</ref>.

We operationalized tie-in advertising as whether the firm supported its placement with a promotional advertising campaign, which we identified through a Factiva search. We measured brand equity as the brand's value in billions of dollars from BusinessWeek's top 100 global brands in 2002, a valid measure of brand equity <ref type="bibr" coords="6,54.00,614.71,141.58,8.79">(Madden, Fehle, and Fornier 2006)</ref>. We also controlled for the market value of the firm on the event day, which we determined by multiplying the closing stock price on the event day by the number of shares outstanding.</p><p>Film factors. To proxy audience absorption, we used the decimal equivalent of the film's grade from CinemaScore, a market research firm that surveys opening-night audiences about how much they enjoyed the film. Enjoyment is a good proxy for absorption for two reasons. First, theorists assert that one key element of an enjoyable book, or film, is that it is absorbing; it transports people from their mundane reality into a story world <ref type="bibr" coords="6,392.04,59.21,141.17,8.79" target="#b44">(Green, Brock, and Kaufman 2004)</ref>. Second, it has been empirically determined that enjoyment is highly correlated with absorption levels (ρ = .77) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,520.10,82.21,37.90,8.79;6,318.00,93.71,33.99,8.79" target="#b44">(Green et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>We measured critical acclaim as the film's META-SCORE, which we obtained from Metacritic.com, a Web site that aggregates the ratings of approximately 40 film critics. Using this score, we developed an index (0-100) of critical sentiment toward the film. We determined the film's level of violence, profanity, and sexuality using data from Kids-In-Mind, one of the oldest and most popular film content advisory services. Kids-In-Mind employs trained reviewers who screen for objectionable material and then rate the film's amount of violence, profanity, and sexuality on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. The organization has no political or religious affiliation; it aims to provide an "objective" account of the level of violence, sex, and profanity in the film, without making value judgments about the age appropriateness of the content <ref type="bibr" coords="6,491.04,266.21,66.95,8.79;6,318.00,277.71,53.44,8.79" target="#b96">(Thompson and Yokota 2004)</ref>. Kids-In-Mind does not provide a rating for drug content, so we had two independent coders review the films and record the instances of drug use. We included the film's opening three-day gross in the model to control for the placement's potential reach. We also included the number of placements in the film for other firms to control for competitive interference from other placements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Execution factors.</head><p>To account for the idiosyncrasies in placement execution, we captured measures for all execution factors previously found to affect consumers' placement processing. The placement's "plot connection" reflected whether the placement advanced the plot or increased the audience's understanding of a main character <ref type="bibr" coords="6,318.00,433.21,59.00,8.79" target="#b85">(Russell 2002)</ref>. To control for placement "modality," we captured the number of audiovisual placements for the firm in the film. We incorporated the "prominence of the visual placement" by capturing the placement's time on screen, the time in the background, and the time that the product was the only placement on screen <ref type="bibr" coords="6,460.38,490.71,93.31,8.79" target="#b49">(Gupta and Lord 1998)</ref>. We captured the "valence of the audio placement" to control for differences in endorsement <ref type="bibr" coords="6,477.05,513.71,80.97,8.79;6,318.00,525.21,17.21,8.79">(Russell and Stern 2006</ref>). An audio mention was positive (negative) if it was a favorable (critical) comment about the product. Comments that were neither positive nor negative were considered neutral. However, perfect multicollinearity with plot connection prevented positive valence from being included in the analysis. Because of their high correlation with plot connection, we did not include time in background and neutral valence to minimize the potential problems of multicollinearity.</p><p>We controlled for "star association" because celebrities increase attention, recall, and purchase intent <ref type="bibr" coords="6,503.15,640.21,54.86,8.79;6,318.00,651.71,68.88,8.79" target="#b1">(Agrawal and Kamakura 1995)</ref>.

The appearance of a product during a scene was considered a placement.

Following McWilliams and Siegal's (1997) recommendations, we used a Factiva database search to remove firms with information related to earnings, earnings guidance, mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, stock splits, changes in key executives, layoffs, restructurings, joint ventures, lawsuits, major new product announcements, regulatory announcements, stock buybacks, and unexpected changes in the dividend during a period extending from four days before to two days after the film's opening. After we eliminated these confounding events, 126 events remained in our sample (see <ref type="table" coords="10,72.67,128.21,28.32,8.79" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>).

However, we believe that the initial press announcement does not provide sufficient information for investors, because investors cannot gauge how consumers will respond to the placement until they know how the product appears in the film, and this information is not known until the film is shown.

To confirm that we appropriately specified our event, we examined investor reaction to the press announcements of film product placements. A Factiva database search identified 25 press announcements of a product placement before the [-2, 0] event window. After we removed the 9 announcements with confounding information, a model employing the same estimation parameters documented no significant abnormal return for the remaining 16 announcements: CAAR [-1, 0] = -.48%, t-statistic = -.53; AR [0, 0] = -.42%, t-statistic = -.67; CAAR [0, 1] = -.47%, t-statistic = -.52. This suggests that there is no stock price movement associated with the announcement of a film placement in the press, which supports our view that the press report does not provide sufficient information for investors to evaluate the placement.</p><p>However, two additional analyses suggest that this publicity encourages investor attention to the film and provides clues as to how the market is informed of placement information. First, we conducted interviews with managers from eight firms that had engaged in product placement activities in our sample and with six investment analysts. These firms indicated that their placement publicity is primarily designed to build consumer awareness for the placement, but they also sometimes communicate placement information directly to the financial community by discussing placements during quarterly analyst calls and by distributing press releases. In general, analysts appeared cognizant of film product placement's positive effects and noted that the market is keyed to film placement by these press releases and the trade press, through the firm's consumer promotions, and also by firm earnings calls. Second, we compared the abnormal returns between announced and unannounced placements to test the idea that this publicity draws additional attention to the film's release, as the investor recognition hypothesis would suggest (Merton    1987). The results suggest that there is a positive relationship between film placement announcement and the magnitude of the [-2, 0] abnormal return (M Announced = 1.84, n = 25; M Unannounced = .65, n = 101; F 1, 124 = 3.64, p = .06). This supports the idea that prerelease publicity strengthens the market's attention to the film and the placement and draws investors to investigate the film. 2</p></div>

The control model is significant (F 18, 107 = 4.08, p &lt; .01).

The abnormal return is unrelated to the film's profanity, sexuality, and drug use. Furthermore, we find that the worth of product placement in successful films is largely unrelated to the execution factors of plot connection, prominence, and valence. Association with a star has no effect on placement worth, but pairings with recurrent characters are valuable (b Recurrent character = 2.52, p &lt; .01). Placing multiple brands in the film enhances the firm's abnormal return (b # of brands = 1.53, p &lt; .01), but our evidence suggests that blatancy has a dampening effect (b Blatant placement = -1.74, p = .08).

The full model is significant (F 22, 103 = 4.91, p &lt; .01), with a higher adjusted R-square. The superiority of the full model is further supported by its lower Bayesian information criteria value (BIC full model = 1090.52, BIC controls only = 1104.10), despite its additional parameters. We find strong support for the idea that placement worth is contingent on the product and film factors affecting consumers' response to placements. The abnormal return from the placement is enhanced by the presence of a tie-in advertising campaign (b Tie-in advertising = 2.19, p &lt; .01), in support of H 2 . We also find that placement worth is positively related to the product's brand equity (b Brand equity = .02, p &lt; .05), in support of H 3 .

Finally, we find evidence for saturation effects in that many placements in the film tend to dampen placement value.</p><p>We find that the effects of the control variables are largely consistent between the two models. We continue to find positive relationships between opening weekend gross, recurrent character associations, and the number of brands in the film and the firm's standardized abnormal return. The attenuating effects for blatancy and competitive interference continue to hold as well. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that audiovisual placement enhances the placement's return, and we find weak evidence that low-plot audio placements are less valuable. Although prior studies have found support for the role of plot connection and prominence, our results suggest that these factors are subordinate to the effects of other execution factors and the effects of the program. <ref type="bibr" coords="14,105.34,357.66,3.75,6.59">6</ref> Placement worth is also enhanced when the product is associated with an established screen character but not when the product is associated with a star.

These results suggest that the symbolic meaning is carried more by the character and the film than by the actor's celebrity.

Thus, MM-estimation combines the high breakdown property of the S-estimator (.25) and high efficiency (.95) (see <ref type="bibr" coords="14,534.66,155.54,23.34,8.79;14,318.00,167.04,21.52,8.79" target="#b102">Yohai 1987)</ref>. The results remain largely the same under the robust regression (see <ref type="table" coords="14,384.22,178.54,30.25,8.79" target="#tab_9">Table 7</ref>). We continue to find significant effects for all the hypothesized product and film factors, which suggests that these findings are robust. The robust regression estimates for the number of brands, the number of other placements in the film, audience size, and audiovisual placement are also significant, thus strengthening confidence in these results. However, the robust estimates provide weaker evidence for the effects of placement blatancy and recurrent characters.</p><p>In summary, by simultaneously considering the effects of product, film, and execution factors, we present a more comprehensive picture of the factors driving placement worth. This study expands the product placement literature by providing new insights into the effect of program factors-the film's absorption, critical acclaim, and violenceon placement outcomes. The study also provides the first evidence for the importance of tie-in advertising and brand equity, and it provides evidence for the value of recurrent character associations and the pernicious effects of placement blatancy. The multiplicity of factors shown to affect placement worth highlights the importance of complementing experimental and intercept studies of placement execution with comparisons of outcomes across brands and programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our conclusions are subject to several limitations, which should be addressed in further research. First, we restricted our examination of film product placement worth to the films with the largest opening audiences in 2002. Our significant result for the film's opening strongly suggests that there could be a critical audience size threshold before investors consider a placement worthwhile. Research on a random sample of films across multiple years is needed to determine whether placements in smaller films produce similar effects on firm market value. However, the substantial increase in customer traffic to the Internet dating site featured in Must Love Dogs <ref type="bibr" coords="14,446.25,613.38,71.60,8.79" target="#b97">(Turnquist 2005)</ref> provides some evidence that placements in less popular films may be worthwhile as well. Furthermore, care should be taken when generalizing our cross-sectional findings because our sample primarily comprises absorbing, successful films.</p><p>Second, our sample is limited to films released in 2002, and we cannot eliminate the possibility that there is something idiosyncratic to this year. However, because consumers' resistance to traditional television advertising and  Third, our research rests on the assumption that the abnormal return we observe is driven by the appearance of the product in the film. We assume that investors draw conclusions about the firm's future profitability as a result of film placement and that this information is reflected in the movement of the firm's stock price. Therefore, an additional caveat is that the event study methodology does not identify the precise mechanism for explaining why the abnormal return occurs <ref type="bibr" coords="15,373.74,105.21,153.02,8.79" target="#b12">(Bayus, Erickson, and Jacobson 2003)</ref>. Given the prior research documenting consumers' attitudinal and behavioral responses to placements, we assumed that investors react to the placement according to how they believe the placement will affect consumers (and the resulting earning impact), and we provided some evidence to support this view; additional data from the investment community are needed to validate this assumption more fully. Furthermore, additional research is needed to tie film product placement more directly to firm revenues and profits, enabling return-on-investment comparisons between placements and other types of marketing communications.</p><p>Finally, two limitations associated with our event study procedure may also have an impact on our findings. First, many events can cause changes in both stocks' return and volatility, and this event-induced heteroskedasticity, if present, can inflate associated test statistics. Currently, finance scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,377.63,300.71,142.07,8.79" target="#b11">Battalio, Ellul, and Jennings 2007)</ref> compensate for this by using a standardized cross-sectional test, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="15,377.89,323.71,175.90,8.79" target="#b13">Boehmer, Musumeci, and Poulsen (1991)</ref>. However, this method stipulates that securities' residuals be cross-sectionally uncorrelated; thus, it does not seem to be possible to control for both event-induced heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence in the securities' residuals simultaneously. The results from <ref type="bibr" coords="15,472.01,381.21,85.99,8.79;15,318.00,392.71,26.65,8.79" target="#b14">Breusch and Pagan's (1980)</ref> test indicate that there is cross-sectional dependence in the residuals in our sample, and therefore we are unable to control for possible event-induced heteroskedasticity, and this is a limitation of our study. Second, thin security trading can introduce bias into the estimates of the market model. Following recent finance literature <ref type="bibr" coords="15,489.84,450.21,63.50,8.79;15,318.00,461.71,84.09,8.79" target="#b5">(Avramov, Chordia, and Goyal 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,404.70,461.71,103.22,8.79" target="#b75">McNally and Smith 2007)</ref>, we implicitly controlled for illiquid penny stocks by excluding from our sample all the shares trading at prices below $1. Note that other authors employ a stricter $5 cutoff criterion to minimize this bias (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,421.45,507.71,50.78,8.79" target="#b104">Zhang 2006)</ref>. However, the three firms in our sample with stocks priced below $5 are regularly traded, with more than a million shares traded per day; therefore, the more inclusive criterion seems to be more appropriate for our sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Further Research</head><p>Our theoretical framework explains a substantial amount of the variance in the worth of placements in successful films, but the inclusion of additional factors might yield a more comprehensive understanding. Scholars have suggested that the value of an endorsement depends on the match between the celebrity and the product <ref type="bibr" coords="15,435.82,681.21,74.08,8.79" target="#b74">(McCracken 1989)</ref>. Extending this logic, we suggest that the worth of film product placement could depend on the match of the product, the film, and the film's audience. Although we can point to examples in which fit likely contributed to the placement's positive abnormal returns (e.g., Vans in XXX), a more comprehensive examination is needed of how placement worth is enhanced by the congruence of the film's thematic elements and the brand's overall strategy and how this is moderated by the degree of overlap in the brand's and the film's target audiences. Evidence also suggests that products with the right fit can transcend the negative effects of other film factors. For example, the motorcycle manufacturer Ducati had positive abnormal returns from placement in the violent Blade II, and the soaring sales of pinot after Sideways suggest that product placements in acclaimed films can succeed when product-film-audience fit is organic.</p><p>For certain product categories, however, we expect fit to be a secondary concern. Logic suggests that tobacco firms disproportionately benefit when their brands appear on film because of the restrictions on tobacco advertising. We find that investors react positively when cigarette brands appear in films (b Tobacco = 2.57, p = .04), a result that may be troubling to regulators.</p><p>Another element that has not been specifically addressed is the worth of placements in period films. Cultural consumption meanings and associations may be altered when the film depicts characters and situations occurring in the past, dampening placement worth. In Catch Me if You Can, Leonardo DiCaprio's purchase of a Cadillac for his father may have harmed the brand by reinforcing the perception that Cadillac is the choice of an older generation.</p><p>Also warranting further investigation is why investors do not reward placements with stars. One reason could be that the star's involvement with the product is attributed to external causes, such as studio demands, which limits the transfer of the celebrity's associations. A second reason could be that investors' reactions are tempered by the character the star plays on-screen. Research is needed to examine the impact of character associations when consumers hold either negative or ambivalent associations with the character.</p><p>Finally, as research on product placement continues to accumulate, it is necessary to investigate the extent to which placement findings do not generalize across mediums. For example, consumers may be more tolerant of blatant placements in television because broadcast television is a free, advertising-supported medium. Thus, differences in television and film viewing habits <ref type="bibr" coords="16,172.82,542.21,100.88,8.79">(Russell and Stern 2006)</ref> may also alter the factors that drive placement worth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Practice: Managing Film Placements</head><p>For firms, this research provides the first evidence that investors consider film placement a wise marketing practice. Furthermore, the results provide new guidance for firms as they consider product placement opportunities, encouraging firms to consider audience absorption, the film's violence, and the film's critical acclaim in their placement decisions. Firms can use cues such as the script, the director, and the studio to make informed judgments about how the film will perform on these dimensions, but firms should be cautious when the script suggests exposure that would disrupt the film.</p><p>However, the results also highlight the difficulties involved in choosing which film placement opportunities to pursue. For example, critical acclaim and violence increase the size of the film's audience <ref type="bibr" coords="16,452.42,70.71,105.58,8.79;16,318.00,82.21,49.26,8.79" target="#b10">(Basuroy, Chatterjee, and Ravid 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,370.07,82.21,116.93,8.79" target="#b33">Eliashberg and Shugan 1997)</ref>, which enhances placement worth, but these film factors also lead to negative consumer responses, which inhibit placement value. Star association has no direct effect on placement worth, but stars increase the number of consumers who see the film (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,341.27,139.71,54.51,8.79" target="#b32">Elberse 2007)</ref>. Therefore, this suggests that firms can face trade-offs between the number of consumers exposed to the placement and the quality of consumer response, and thus firms should consider a multiplicity of factors when selecting films for placement. It would not necessarily be wise to avoid enjoyable, absorbing films or violent filmsbecause these films tend to perform well at the box officebut when firms are confident that a film will be a blockbuster, they should not be inattentive to absorption and violence and their deleterious effects.</p><p>A further challenge then for firms is predicting the film's box office success. Although there are a few guideposts for which films are likely to perform well (i.e., sequels, prediction markets), it can be difficult to predict whether a particular firm will be successful. This challenge is most acute when a firm makes a substantial investment in a film, only to have it disappoint at the box office. To mitigate their risk, firms could negotiate "make-good" placements, as in traditional advertising, if the film's audience fails to meet expectations. Firms could also encourage the development of a "scatter" market-for placements that could be inserted during postproduction-because forecasts of a film's box office success are more accurate after initial test screenings. A portfolio strategy could also diversify the risk associated with film performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Practice: Measuring and Pricing Placements</head><p>For practice, this research offers three clear recommendations for placement measurement and pricing. First, although there is no one accepted measure for valuing product placements, the current services compare the film placement's exposure with the cost and effectiveness of an equivalent 30-second television commercial <ref type="bibr" coords="16,474.57,520.21,50.54,8.79" target="#b88">(Shiller 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,532.17,520.21,17.22,8.79">(Shiller , 2008</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix</head><p>Several studies in the finance and accounting literature have pointed out the potential effect of the cross-sectional correlation problem of residual returns in hypothesis testing when events share a common date (e.g., MacKinley 1997). Cross-sectional dependence in the returns biases the standard deviation estimate downward, inflating the associated test statistics. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,110.90,240.71,48.87,8.79" target="#b56">Jaffe (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="17,180.29,240.71,72.91,8.79" target="#b72">Mandelker (1974)</ref> introduce the portfolio method to correct for this bias. Adopting their methodology, we form a portfolio for every day in calendar time by including all securities that experience an event at that time-for example, if there are several firms that have product placements in the same movie or if there are several movie openings on the same day. For each portfolio, the securities and their return measures are equally weighted. We begin by calculating the average abnormal returns AAR Pt for all portfolios:</p><p>where S is the number of securities in portfolio P and AR i is the abnormal return for stock i in portfolio P. Next, for every portfolio P, we calculate a time-series estimate of σ(AAR Pt ) for the preceding k days, assuming that the Then, we calculate the average standardized residual across all portfolios in calendar time:</p><p>where D t = 1 when there is at least one security in portfolio t and D t = 0 when there are no securities in portfolio t; n is the number of days in which the portfolios have at least one security:</p><p>Finally, we estimate the cumulative average standardized average abnormal returns:</p><p>If the ASAAR are independent over time, the standard deviation of the CASAAR S1, S2 is as follows:</p><p>Then, the test statistic is as follows: </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,282.81,36.00,46.39,9.25;4,120.84,48.00,370.35,9.25"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 A Conceptual Model for the Worth of Product Placements in Successful Films</figDesc></figure>
