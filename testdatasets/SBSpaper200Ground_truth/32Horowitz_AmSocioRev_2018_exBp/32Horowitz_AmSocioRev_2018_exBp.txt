I would like to express thanks to Barbara Entwisle, Arne Kalleberg, Kenneth T. Andrews, Colin Campbell, Ted Mouw, and Jessica Pearlman for their advice and feedback. I also would like to thank the editors and four anonymous reviewers who provided a number of helpful suggestions and critiques. Furthermore, I thank Liying Luo and Claire Y. Yang for ongoing discussions about best practices in cohort analysis. Finally, I would like to thank David Autor and David Dorn for harmonizing occupational coding schemes across years, and for sharing this data on their websites. The occupation skill scores used in this study may be found in Part C of the online supplement or at the following link: https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FNQV7.
