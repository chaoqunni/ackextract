Abstract
Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung diseases are increasingly recognized as chronic
opportunistic infections, occurring in individuals with a wide variety of underlying conditions. In the absence of
systemic immunodeficiency, decision of NTM lung disease treatment must relies on a careful risk/benefit
assessment, given the requirement of long-term administration of multidrug therapies supported by limited
evidence. The primary objective was to identify the factors associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation. Clinical
and radiological outcome upon treatment were studied.
Methods: This retrospective, single center study (2013–2016, 45 months) addressed the criteria supporting
treatment decision among adults with NTM lung disease without systemic immunodeficiency at our institution,
with the assigned goal to harmonize the practice. All patients matched the current international definitions of NTM
lung disease according to the American Thoracic Society criteria. Factors associated with anti-NTM treatment were
investigated by conditional logistic regression. Clinical and radiological outcomes of treated and untreated NTMdisease cases were examined. Mortality rate was assessed. An expert radiologist conducted a blinded computed
tomography (CT)-scan review of the treated and untreated patients.

Results: Among 51 cases of NTM lung diseases, 25 (49%) received anti-NTM treatment. In univariate analysis, a
body mass index (BMI) < 18 kg/m2 (odds ratio (OR), 4.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–15.2]; p = 0.042),
hemoptysis (OR, 11.8 [95% CI 1.35–12.9]; p = 0.026), excavation(s) (OR, 4.8 [95% CI 1.4–16.4], p = 0.012), prior
anti-NTM treatment (OR, 5.65 [95% CI 1.06–29.9]; p = 0.042), Aspergillus spp. co-infection (OR, 6.3 [95% CI 1.8–22.2];
p = 0.004) were associated with treatment initiation. In multivariate analysis, Aspergillus spp. co-infection was the
only independent determinant of treatment initiation (OR, 5.3 [95% CI 1.1–25.4]; p = 0.036). Twenty-one (81%)
patients received ≥3 anti-NTM drugs. Median treatment duration and follow-up were 36.3 (interquartile range [IQR],
13.1–64.4) weeks and 17.1 (IQR, 8.7–27.1) months, respectively. Regarding radiological outcome, 85 CT-scans were
reviewed, showing similar rates of regression or stabilization in treated and untreated patients. Overall mortality rate
was not different in treated and untreated patients.
Conclusion: The most relevant variable associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation was Aspergillus spp. co-infection.
Radiological regression or stabilization of pulmonary lesions was not different between the treated and
untreated patients.

Background
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous
bacteria of environmental origin including a widely
diverse number of species (> 160), some of which cause
disease in humans [1–3]. Prevalence of NTM lung
diseases is unexpectedly increasing in industrialized
countries, as consistently uncovered by recent studies
[3, 4]. The key issue remains to determine whether
NTM are the true and single promoter of an evolving
lung disease or chronic airway colonizers, among others.
To standardize the diagnosis of NTM lung disease, the
guidelines for NTM diagnosis of the American Thoracic
Society (ATS)/Infectious Disease Society of America
(IDSA) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS) require
isolation and growth of the same NTM strain on at least
two separate samples from the patient [5, 6].
Human host and pathogenic NTM relationship is still
poorly understood, as NTM virulence is highly variable
from one species to another. NTM lung disease is
strongly associated with pre-existing pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), cystic fibrosis, idiopathic bronchiectasis, prior
active tuberculosis or pneumoconiosis [6]. It is also
frequently associated with genetic or acquired systemic
immune deficiency such as defects in the pathways of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α or interferon (IFN)-γ, immunosuppressive treatments (including anti-TNF-α therapy or corticosteroids), solid-organ transplantation, or acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [1–7]. However, it may
also occur in individuals without recognized severe
immune local or systemic deficiency. In the absence of
patent predisposition, NTM diseases are overrepresented

among the specific morphotype of slender women with
a low body fat [8].
Treatment decision for NTM lung disease is challenging. There is debate as to which patients should benefit
the most from treatment according to medical background, comorbidities, clinical status, radiologic features
and causal NTM strain. Assessment of clinical, microbiologic, and radiologic response to treatment is not
standardized as well. We focused on NTM lung diseases
in adults without systemic immunodeficiency that met
the ATS criteria guidelines. Based on the comparison of
a group of treated and untreated patients, the primary
objective was to identify the factors associated with
physician decision of initiating anti-NTM treatment. Secondary objectives were to study the outcome upon treatment and to propose a standardized evaluation for the
diagnosis and decision making to treatment of NTM lung
diseases in adults without systemic immunodeficiency.

Methods
Study design and patient population

We conducted a retrospective, observational, single-center
study between January 2013 and February 2016 (45
months) among adults (≥ 18 year-old) without systemic
immunosuppression presenting NTM lung disease. Exclusion criteria were HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, primary
ciliary dyskinesia, active malignant disease, solid-organ
transplantation or ongoing immunosuppressant treatments such as TNF inhibitor or high-dose corticosteroid
(≥ 1 mg/kg more than 21 days). Case identification was
based on cross-referencing the databases of the mycobacteria laboratory and the departments of infectious and
pulmonary diseases. Patients eligible for inclusion in the
NTM lung disease cohort were those who matched the

Provoost et al. BMC Infectious Diseases

criteria previously defined by the ATS/IDSA and the BTS
guidelines with the minimum requirement of clinical and
microbiologic following criteria: (i) pulmonary symptoms
associated with multifocal bronchiectasis with multiple
small nodules on computed tomography (CT)-scan; (ii)
proper exclusion of other diagnoses; (iii) NTM-positive
culture results from at least two separate expectorated
sputum samples or a NTM-positive culture result from at
least one bronchial wash or lavage [5, 6]. Patients’ characteristics at diagnosis were collected in order to perform
analysis on 146 selected variables: demographics; history
of predisposing factors; underlying pulmonary diseases;
comorbidities; pulmonary function testing; respiratory
bacterial or mycological co-infection(s), which definition
was similar to NTM criteria, namely positive culture
isolation of the same species from at least two separate
expectorated sputum samples or a positive culture result
from at least one bronchial wash or lavage; immunologic
status; nutritional status; clinical features; microbiologic
assessment through identification of NTM species on
positive NTM cultures and sample culture conversions;
radiologic features on high-resolution CT-scans (fibrocavitary disease or nodular/bronchiectasis disease); prior treatment for NTM lung disease, treatment combination and
duration; outcome. Because of the retrospective observational nature of the study and the lack of any modification
in patients’ management, the need for informed consent
was waived with the authorization of the Ethics Committee of Lyon University Hospital (Comité d’Ethique,
Hospices Civils de Lyon), which approved the study under
the number 17–207.
Radiologic assessment

An independent expert chest radiologist, blinded to the
patient information, retrospectively reviewed the
CT-scans performed without injection of intravenous
contrast media, assigned in random order at diagnosis
and six to 24 months after treatment or during the
follow up of the untreated patients. The number and size
of cavity(ies) and their wall thickness were evaluated in
the lung window setting. Nodular opacity(ies) (≥ 10 mm),
cluster(s) of small nodules (≤ 5 mm), the tree-in-bud
pattern, the presence of bronchiectasis in any of the lobes
or multifocal bronchiectasis were evaluated. Based on the
number and size of the lesions, the expert classified the
lesions as improved, stable or worsening.
Endpoints

The primary endpoint was to identify the factors significantly involved in the decision of initiating anti-NTM
treatment by patient referent physician. Secondary endpoints were the assessment of clinical and radiological
outcomes upon anti-NTM treatment in comparison with
no treatment. Based on these findings, a standardized

Page 3 of 9

appraisal was proposed to assist diagnosis management
and treatment decision for NTM lung diseases in adults
without altered systemic immunity.
Statistical analysis

Descriptive data were used to estimate the frequencies
of the study variables. There were expressed as count
(percentage, %) for dichotomous variables and as medians (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous values.
The number of missing values was excluded from the
denominator. Non-parametric statistical methods Fisher
exact test, χ2 test and Mann-Whitney U test were used
to compare groups, where appropriate. The probability
of treatment initiation over time was evaluated by
Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, with group comparison using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Stepwise
binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the
determinants for treatment initiation, expressed as odd
ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
After checking the variables for interactions, variables
with medical meaning and with p-values obtained in the
univariate analysis of < 0.15 were included in the final
multivariate model. A value of p < 0.05 was considered
significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS
software version 24.0 (SPSS. Chicago. IL).

Results
Out of 149 patients eligible to ATS/IDSA NTM lung
disease criteria, 51 patients were included in the study,
of who 25 (49%) received and 26 (51%) did not receive
anti-NTM treatment (Fig. 1). The median age was 68
(interquartile range [IQR], 59–75) year-old with a male/
female ratio of 0.76. Etiologic NTM agents were Mycobacterium avium (n = 17, 33.3%), M. chimaerae (n = 14,
27.5%), M. xenopii (n = 9, 17.6%), M. intracellulare (n =
9, 17.6%), M. simiae (n = 3, 5.9%), M. kansasii (n = 1,
2%), and M. abscessus (n = 1, 2%), with three patients
having ≥2 concomitant NTM lung diseases. Importantly,
the evidence of NTM lung disease has led to diagnose
six underlying chronic lung diseases, of which a genetically documented cystic fibrosis in a 61 year-old women.
On descriptive analysis, patient’s characteristics did not
significantly differ, to the exception of a lower BMI (p =
0.023) and a higher number of previously known NTM
lung disease (p = 0.038) in treated versus untreated patients (Table 1). Notable percentages of missing data at
diagnosis have to be acknowledged for active tobacco
smoking (64.7%, n = 33), respiratory functional testing
(23.5%, n = 12) with a very few patients having a 6-min
walk test, baseline arterial blood oxygenation levels
(58.8%, n = 30), CT-scan follow up within 24 months
after diagnosis in untreated patients (46%, n = 12).
Factors leading the patient referent physician to initiate
anti-NTM treatment were assessed using bivariate analysis.

Among the factors significantly associated with treatment
were the BMI < 18 kg/m2 (odds ratio (OR), 4.2 [95%

no excavation (p = 0.005) (Fig. 2a, b, c and d, respectively).
In the treated group, 21 (84%) received ≥3 anti-NTM
drugs, among whom 23 (92%) received a macrolide as part
of a first-line regimen. Median anti-NTM treatment
duration was 36.3 (IQR, 13.1–64.4) weeks. Thirteen (52%)
of the treated patients developed at least one
antimicrobial-related adverse event, among which
gastrointestinal disorders (n = 6), impaired blood cell
count (n = 5) and cholestatic and/or cytolytic hepatitis
(n = 4). According to physician judgment, clinical
stabilization and improvement was obtained for 8 (34.8%)
and 12 (52.2%) of treated patients, respectively. Patient’s
median follow-up from diagnosis assessment was 17.1
(IQR, 8.7–27.1) months. Eighty-five CT-scans were
reviewed for comparative assessment after treatment or
over the course of follow-up in the untreated subset. The
median interval between the initiation of NTM treatment
and the date of the assessed images was 56.7 (IQR, 43.3–
97.7) weeks. Although 34.8% (n = 8) and 39.1% (n = 9)
experienced regression or stabilization of their pulmonary
lesions in the treated patients, these rates did not differ

from the untreated patients with 30.8% (n = 4) and 46.2%
(n = 6) of regression and stabilization over the course of
their follow-up, respectively (Table 2). Finally, all-cause
mortality was not different between treated and untreated
groups, although lost to follow-up was high in the
untreated group (n = 10, 38.5%). Regarding the four
patients that deceased (n = 3 in the treated group and
n = 1 in the untreated group), the cause of mortality
was linked to the underlying diseases rather than
NTM-related mortality.

Discussion
In the present study, treated patients were characterized by
BMI < 18 kg/m2, presence of hemoptysis and excavation(s),
Aspergillus spp. co-infection, and prior anti-NTM treatment. Aspergillus spp. co-infection was the only independent factor associated with treatment initiation. A single
study from five English centers has recently addressed the
factors that influence anti-NTM treatment initiation using
similar retrospective design of treated and untreated cohort
comparison (2010–2014), to the exception of different

Here, three out of four criteria are part of guideline criteria leading to decision of anti-NTM treatment. They all
reflect a degree of severity of NTM lung disease linked with
progression of an impaired respiratory condition. The
current problematic of NTM lung diseases shifts from distinguishing colonization from infection toward differentiating stable, poorly active vs. progressive active NTM disease,
the latter being responsible for further structural lung damage(s). The risk/benefit analysis includes prescribing recommended long-term multidrug regimens with concerns over
suboptimal cure rates and frequently reported drug-related
side effects. To support these arguments, others have
already shown that physician ATS/IDSA guideline

Provoost et al. BMC Infectious Diseases

adherence is moderate confirming such a trend of intuitive
clinical behavior mostly based on evidence of severity and/
or patent progression of the disease. A multicenter study
has reported a sample of 349 US physicians treating 915 patients with M. avium complex (MAC) lung disease. Overall,
55% (n = 411) of patients with MAC lung disease received
some type of anti-NTM treatment from their physician and
13% prescribed antibiotic regimens were consistent with
ATS/IDSA guidelines [10]. Another study conducted in
France has shown that among a cohort of 31 NTM lung
diseases, only 12 (38.7%) received appropriate treatment
matching ATS/IDSA guidelines [11]. Inappropriate
prescriptions were mostly related to shorter treatment
duration (6 months or less) and/or off-recommendation
regimen, particularly those excluding macrolide from the
combination or those using a single-drug macrolide
regimen [10, 11]. It has to be acknowledged that
guidelines specify that treatment for MAC-associated
lung disease in HIV-negative individuals can be a
three-times-weekly drug regimen upon culture conversion while on therapy for 1 year, which may favor
treatment compliance [5, 12, 13].
Patients with bronchiectasis and NTM lung disease have
a higher prevalence of being sensitized to Aspergillus than
patients with NTM-free bronchiectasis [12]. Allergic airway manifestations in response to Aspergillus are termed
Aspergillus-related lung diseases with a spectrum going
from Aspergillus-induced hypersensitivity to the severe allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) [14]. By itself, the coexistence of NTM and Aspergillus in lung
airway justifies the need for testing Aspergillus serology,
total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and Aspergillus-specific
IgE levels as well as mycological direct examination and
culture of sputum or bronchial aspirates for presence of
filamentous fungi in the diagnosis algorithm of patients
with NTM lung diseases. Active co-infections with NTM
and Aspergillus spp. have also been described, in which
patients with NTM lung disease develop chronic forms of
pulmonary aspergillosis which definitions and management have been revisited in recent updated guidelines
[14–17].
Radiographic improvement may be hampered by
concomitant lung disease and the limited potential for
resolution of consolidated radiologic abnormalities. A
previous study has investigated radiologic response to
treatment showing consistent results with those found
in the present study. Although anti-NTM treatment led
to an improvement or stabilization of lesions for a
majority of patients, these modifications were not
significantly different from the untreated group who
went through CT-scan follow up indicating that
anti-NTM treatment did not lead to radiological abnormalities reversion [9]. The present study has strengths
and limitations. The strength is the study of the largest

cohort so far of NTM lung diseases in patients without
systemic immunodeficiency with exhaustive data collection and blinded radiological assessment. We acknowledge the biases that contribute to mitigate conclusions
from the study such as being conducted in a single center, the important differences in physician’s management
resulting in lack of consistency in treatment decision
making, the number of missing data. In addition, the
CT-scans were not performed at fixed intervals, particularly in the untreated subset of patients. Finally,
treatment duration and outcome criteria were not
standardized, which prevent to properly assess treatment efficacy. Useful consensus definitions for key
outcome parameters to be used in the treatment of
NTM lung diseases have been released very recently,
which should harmonize data collection regarding
NTM treatment [18].
Future researches are necessary to better define criteria
associated with progressive active NTM disease in the immunocompetent setting. Concretely, this preliminary
study has led to implement in our institution a standardized appraisal for the diagnosis of NTM lung diseases in
this particular setting (Table 4). The aim is to provide a future basis for the development of a diagnosis scoring system supporting anti-NTM treatment decision. Future
studies should focus as well on the most relevant CT imaging variables associated with response to treatment over
time that may be applied in future clinical trials to assess
treatment outcome.

Conclusions
In summary, the main factors supporting anti-NTM treatment decision in immunocompetent were low BMI,
hemoptysis, lung excavation(s), prior anti-NTM treatment
and Aspergillus pp. co-infection, the latter being the only
independent factor. Anti-NTM treatment did not achieve
radiological abnormalities reversion, as pulmonary lesions
assessment showed no difference between the treated and
the untreated patients. A diagnosis of NTM lung disease
in an immunocompetent patient requires investigating the
presence of a chronic pulmonary underlying disease.
