This study examines the consequences and psychological processes of (dis)similar levels of LMX on the interpersonal interactions between coworkers. Using data from 2 independent studies, the results of social relations analyses show that (a) actual (dis)similarity in LMX between Coworkers A and B increases Coworker A's feelings of contempt for Coworker B and decreases Coworker A's perception of help received from Coworker B (Study 1); (b) Coworker A is more likely to experience contempt for Coworker B when Coworker A perceives that he/she has a higher or lower level of LMX compared to Coworker B than when Coworker A perceives that his/her level of LMX is similar to Coworker B's (Study 2); and (c) these relationships only hold true for employees with a high social comparison orientation (SCO) in both Studies 1 and 2. Particularly, in Study 1, we also show that contempt is a crucial mediator that transmits the interactive effect of LMX (dis)similarity and SCO on perceptions of help received from coworkers. Furthermore, an average level of perceived help from coworkers is positively related to the sales performance of individual employees.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Leader-member exchange (LMX) theory emphasizes that leaders develop a differential quality of dyadic relationships with followers such that within work groups, they form low-quality transactional relationships with some and high-quality socioemo-tional relationships with others <ref type="bibr" coords="1,418.80,460.04,123.38,7.91" target="#b16">(Dansereau, Graen, &amp; Haga, 1975)</ref>. Previous research has demonstrated that LMX quality has strong implications for employees' work attitudes and behaviors (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.00,493.31,82.59,7.91" target="#b34">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,390.88,493.31,130.88,7.91" target="#b50">Ilies, Nahrgang, &amp; Morgeson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,524.04,493.31,17.60,7.91;1,306.00,504.40,138.94,7.91" target="#b71">Rockstuhl, Dulebohn, Ang, &amp; Shore, 2012)</ref>. This research has particularly focused on the positive effects of LMX on vertical dyadic partners. However, our everyday experiences often highlight its negative effects: When a leader has a better quality of LMX with, and thus provides more support and resources to, Subordinate A than to Subordinate B, the different exchange qualities of the two supervisor-subordinate dyads may have detrimental effects on the relationship of the third subordinate-subordinate dyad. To date, research on the potentially adverse impact of LMX beyond the leader-member dyad remains sparse (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,472.34,604.22,73.70,7.91;1,306.00,615.31,127.52,7.91" target="#b44">Henderson, Wayne, Shore, Bommer, &amp; Tetrick, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,437.22,615.31,104.99,7.91;1,306.00,626.40,85.89,7.91" target="#b93">Vidyarthi, Liden, Anand, Erdogan, &amp; Ghosh, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to increase our understanding of the negative consequences of LMX dissimilarity on coworker interactions.</p><p>Drawing primarily on balance theory <ref type="bibr" coords="1,457.04,659.64,52.62,7.91" target="#b42">(Heider, 1958)</ref>, we propose that dissimilarity in LMX between two supervisorsubordinate dyads will create relational imbalance in the triadic relationships among the supervisor and the two subordinates. Such triadic relational imbalance may provoke "hostile" interpersonal emotions (such as contempt, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,416.45,715.04,77.14,7.91">Heider, 1958, p. 190</ref>) between the subordinates, which in turn, will make each subordinate perceive the other as being less helpful. By contrast, similarity in LMX may reduce contempt and increase perceptions of interpersonal help. <ref type="figure" coords="2,48.00,110.04,30.87,7.91">Figure 1</ref> depicts our theoretical model. Investigating the effect of LMX (dis)similarity on coworkers' interpersonal emotions and perceived interactions is theoretically important because these emotions and perceptions have been shown to have implications for both intrapersonal (e.g., work motivation and effort intensity; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,165.04,46.19,7.91" target="#b19">Dirks, 1999)</ref> and interpersonal (e.g., trust, commitment, and conflict; see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,83.95,176.04,78.85,7.91" target="#b69">Reis &amp; Collins, 2000</ref>; helping behaviors; see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.81,176.04,30.22,7.91;2,48.00,187.04,143.41,7.91">Van der Vegt, Bunderson, &amp; Oosterhof, 2006)</ref> outcomes that ultimately determine how well teams function . Our study also adds value to the existing LMX research by showing that perceptions of poor interactions resulting from the (dis)similarity in coworkers' LMX may hinder the performance of individuals over time.</p><p>Building on social comparison theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,206.39,253.04,62.69,7.91" target="#b28">(Festinger, 1954)</ref>, we further extend and enrich balance theory by proposing and examining the social comparison processes that underlie and shape the degree of influence of the relational balance/imbalance in a triad in two independent studies. In Study 1, we indirectly infer the operation of social comparison by examining the interactive effect of Coworker A's and Coworker B's LMX on Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B in order to demonstrate how (dis)similarity in levels of LMX leads to interpersonal "hostile" emotions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,258.32,341.04,29.73,7.91;2,48.00,352.04,52.16,7.91">(Heider, 1958, p. 190)</ref>. Moreover, in Study 2, we directly assess the operation of social comparison by measuring Coworker A's comparison of his/her LMX with that of Coworker B and how such a comparison is related in a U-shaped curvilinear fashion to Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B. In addition, we qualify this effect of comparison processes by investigating the moderating role of individual employees' social comparison orientation (SCO; i.e., having a strong tendency to compare one's status with that of others; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,75.49,440.04,93.73,7.91" target="#b35">Gibbons &amp; Buunk, 1999)</ref> in both studies.</p><p>In a nutshell, the present article contributes to the literature by examining the detrimental consequences of leaders' differential exchange relationships with their subordinates on the interpersonal interactions between subordinates in work groups, by revealing how and when LMX (dis)similarity will have an impact on per-ceptions of received help, and by extending balance theory through testing social comparison explanations for the effect of triadic relational imbalance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Balance Theory and Social Comparison</head><p>The LMX literature suggests that interpersonal exchange relationships between supervisors, subordinates, and coworkers are interrelated and embedded within work groups <ref type="bibr" coords="2,480.66,187.04,65.38,7.91;2,306.00,198.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b44">(Henderson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,328.79,198.04,158.38,7.91" target="#b92">Venkataramani, Green, &amp; Schleicher, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,489.46,198.04,56.58,7.91;2,306.00,209.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b93">Vidyarthi et al., 2010)</ref>. The exchange quality of one dyad, however, can influence the relationship quality developed in the other two dyads <ref type="bibr" coords="2,511.91,220.04,34.14,7.91;2,306.00,231.04,59.44,7.91" target="#b37">(Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995)</ref>. This triadic relationship can be explained by balance theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,365.80,242.04,53.76,7.91" target="#b42">(Heider, 1958)</ref>. A balanced triadic relationship occurs when both Subordinate A and Subordinate B form the same positive (or negative) relationship with Supervisor C. In such a triad, both subordinates tend to experience a harmony that induces more positive and less negative sentiments toward each other. All other combinations of triadic relationships lead to relational imbalance and will therefore trigger negative sentiments (e.g., emotions, attitudes).</p><p>We contend that the psychological process causing such a relational balance or imbalance in triads is social comparison. Researchers in social psychology and social structure have suggested that people are aware of the patterns of surrounding social ties <ref type="bibr" coords="2,321.98,374.04,156.14,7.91" target="#b33">(Freeman, Freeman, &amp; Michaelson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,481.60,374.04,49.59,7.91" target="#b42">Heider, 1958)</ref>. In particular, in a mutually shared environment (i.e., a work group), people can detect the social relationship structure in order to obtain social comparison information that will help them to understand their relative standing in the group <ref type="bibr" coords="2,441.52,418.04,49.50,7.91" target="#b47">(Hogg, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,494.77,418.04,47.37,7.91" target="#b98">Wood, 1996)</ref>. Consistent with this assumption, LMX scholars have also suggested that individual members are aware, through observations and nonverbal communications, of the LMX quality of each peerleader relationship <ref type="bibr" coords="2,376.89,462.04,121.52,7.91" target="#b20">(Duchon, Green, &amp; Taber, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,501.61,462.04,40.11,7.91;2,306.00,473.04,98.73,7.91" target="#b87">Tse, Ashkanasy, &amp; Dasborough, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,406.81,473.04,77.60,7.91" target="#b93">Vidyarthi et al., 2010)</ref>.

Therefore, the actual (dis)similarity of coworkers' LMX may trigger comparative evaluation processes between them which in turn will influence interpersonal sentiments. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,263.56,165.04,24.49,7.91;3,48.00,176.04,23.99,7.91" target="#b42">Heider (1958)</ref> has suggested that it is reasonable to expect actual similarity in certain traits and qualities (such as LMX) to be associated with coworkers' sentiments.</p><p>Only one study to date has used balance theory to understand LMX in a triadic leader-coworker relationship. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,239.80,220.04,48.24,7.91;3,48.00,231.04,49.81,7.91" target="#b81">Sherony and Green (2002)</ref> have demonstrated that two subordinates will develop positive coworker exchange quality (CWX) when they have similar LMX experiences. By contrast, two subordinates will have a negative CWX if they form dissimilar LMX with their leader. Their study provides insights into the impact of LMX (dis)similarity on the quality of coworkers' relationships and attitudes (e.g., work commitment and satisfaction). However, what Sherony and Green did not specifically explore is whether, and if so how, LMX (dis)similarity influences interpersonal emotion exchanges between subordinates. Indeed, the original hypothesis of balance theory focuses on how the degree of balance in a triad broadly influences interpersonal sentiments <ref type="bibr" coords="3,181.90,352.04,49.74,7.91" target="#b40">(Heider, 1944</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,239.50,352.04,15.50,7.91" target="#b41">(Heider, , 1946</ref>. Sentiment here refers to the way one person feels about or evaluates another. Specifically, relational imbalance in a triad may elicit negative sentiments, including "disliking and hostile feelings" directed at the interacting target <ref type="bibr" coords="3,165.35,396.04,78.85,7.91">(Heider, 1958, p. 190)</ref>. Therefore, in the present study, we investigate how LMX (dis)similarity can influence subordinates to experience a hostile interpersonal emotion, namely contempt (i.e., anger, disgust, hatred; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,236.97,429.04,51.08,7.91;3,48.00,440.04,72.48,7.91" target="#b30">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002)</ref> toward each other.</p><p>Contempt has been defined as an "exclusively social emotion" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,462.04,79.76,7.91">(Hess, 2009, p. 100;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,132.44,462.04,61.42,7.91" target="#b72">Roseman, 2001)</ref> which is often targeted toward members who have violated the social norms of hierarchical relations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,93.74,484.04,100.10,7.91" target="#b66">(Melwani &amp; Barsade, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,195.96,484.04,92.10,7.91;3,48.00,495.03,44.47,7.91" target="#b73">Rozin, Lowery, Imada, &amp; Haidt, 1999)</ref>. Contempt typically conveys a sense of disapproval, psychological detachment, social exclusion, and a negative view toward the interacting target (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,184.40,517.03,103.65,7.91" target="#b29">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,528.03,104.13,7.91" target="#b66">Melwani &amp; Barsade, 2011)</ref>. It may be the most theoretically relevant emotion to understanding the consequences of triadic imbalance. Balance theory <ref type="bibr" coords="3,148.27,550.03,53.74,7.91" target="#b42">(Heider, 1958)</ref> suggests that a harmonious, balanced relationship reflects "the requirement of justice" (p. 235), implying that the quality of hierarchical relations among two individuals in a triad is expected to be equal (as reflected by the LMX similarity). In contrast, any individual who deviates from such equitable communal relationships deserves to be disapproved of, socially excluded, and negatively evaluated-typically expressed in the emotional form of contempt. In line with balance theory, the emotion literature has linked contempt with the perceived violation of communal codes such as the integrity of the social order and the expected equity in a hierarchy <ref type="bibr" coords="3,239.75,660.03,48.28,7.91;3,48.00,671.03,19.37,7.91" target="#b73">(Rozin et al., 1999)</ref>. In particular, research has highlighted that contempt often occurs in competitive relationships <ref type="bibr" coords="3,176.54,682.03,67.65,7.91" target="#b30">(Fiske et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,246.57,682.03,41.49,7.91;3,48.00,693.03,55.64,7.91" target="#b49">Hutcherson &amp; Gross, 2011)</ref>. Given that a coworker who has dissimilar LMX violates an actor's expectation of balanced hierarchical relations and the unequal LMX status also indicates that two coworkers are competing for the benefits of a high-quality exchange relationship with a leader <ref type="bibr" coords="3,362.69,88.03,98.30,7.91" target="#b27">(Erdogan &amp; Bauer, 2010)</ref>, an actor's contempt toward the target coworker is likely to be triggered.</p><p>Based on balance theory, we argue that Coworker A will experience more contempt toward Coworker B if both coworkers have different levels of LMX with their supervisor. The dissimilarity in coworkers' LMX (i.e., if Coworker A's LMX is high and Coworker B's is low or if Coworker A's LMX is low and Coworker B's is high) reflects the difference in the coworkers' standing in the triad and may drive the individual to contrast him/herself with the comparison target coworker and focus on the distinguishing features of the target. Such a contrastive comparison may activate an independent self/differentiation mindset, highlighting the selfother LMX discrepancy and relational imbalance and exacerbating the levels of psychological discomfort and tension <ref type="bibr" coords="3,498.06,231.03,47.99,7.91;3,306.00,242.03,88.48,7.91" target="#b1">(Aron, Aron, Tudor, &amp; Nelson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,397.48,242.03,47.74,7.91" target="#b13">Byrne, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,448.21,242.03,42.62,7.91" target="#b80">Shah, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the differentiation mindset activated by LMX dissimilarity may enact the two social-distancing functions of contempt: excluding the low LMX coworker from social relationships and reducing the status of the high LMX coworker <ref type="bibr" coords="3,500.69,286.03,45.35,7.91;3,306.00,297.03,53.37,7.91" target="#b66">(Melwani &amp; Barsade, 2011)</ref>.

AET suggests that discrete emotion helps individuals interpret the meaning of environmental cues, determining their judgment formation and the behavioral consequences. Following this logic, we propose that contempt will transmit the indirect effect of LMX (dis)similarity on perceptions of received help and that the strength of this indirect linkage will hinge on the level of SCO. Specifically, a high-SCO individual is likely to experience less (more) contempt toward another coworker in a triad if their levels of LMX are similar (dissimilar), therefore increasing (decreasing) their perceptions of help received from the coworker. By contrast, low SCO may help to mitigate the indirect effect of LMX (dis)similarity on perceptions of received help because a low-SCO individual is less emotionally sensitive to the social comparison information in the LMX processes.</p><p>In sum, the positive and negative indirect linkages between LMX (dis)similarity and perceptions of received help, as mediated by contempt, should be more pronounced when SCO is high rather than low.

Furthermore, there was a positive bivariate relationship between perception of received help and sales performance.</p><p>Analytical strategy. The round-robin data collected for the purpose of this study has a complex nested structure, with dyadic relationships with other members nested within individuals, and individuals nested within work teams. We therefore analyzed our multilevel model using social relations modeling (SRM; see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,48.00,330.04,48.82,7.91" target="#b54">Kenny, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,98.89,330.04,87.90,7.91" target="#b56">Kenny &amp; La Voie, 1984)</ref>, which is a specific method for analyzing relational data in which the substantial portion of the variance in the dependent variables is located at the dyadic level (i.e., depends on the characteristics of the dyadic relations between actor and target; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,110.60,374.04,91.10,7.91" target="#b56">Kenny &amp; La Voie, 1984)</ref>. The unique feature of SRM is to isolate variance in a social network and test hypotheses at multiple levels of analysis: actor (Coworker A), target (Coworker B), dyad (Coworker A's and Coworker B's relationship), and group. Actor (or perceiver) variance is the proportion that arises from the tendency of an actor to rate all other members in a particular way. Target variance refers to the proportion arising from the tendency of a target to receive similar ratings from other members. Dyadic variance arises from the particular relationship between the perceiver and the target. Group variance arises from group membership, which is influenced by group norms (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,48.00,495.04,50.08,7.91" target="#b54">Kenny, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,101.41,495.04,92.94,7.91" target="#b56">Kenny &amp; La Voie, 1984)</ref>. This specific feature of SRM enables researchers to address questions about how much of the variance in dyadic variables is due to individual-level effects (e.g., LMX, dispositional characteristics, etc.) and how much comes down to questions about reciprocity or mutuality.</p><p>We used MLwin in conjunction with SRM to analyze our data (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,322.70,121.04,164.76,7.91">Snijders &amp; Kenny, 1999, for technical details)</ref>. MLwin helped to justify the multilevel structure of our data by distinguishing between different levels of analysis as well as between random and fixed effects estimates. The random effects estimates indicate the percentages of the total variance in an actor's (i.e., Coworker A) contempt for, and perceptions of help received from, Coworker B that are attributable to the characteristics of the actor, the target (at the individual level), the dyadic relationship, and the team. The fixed effect estimates indicate the strength of the relationship between the independent variables (i.e., the [dis]similarity in LMX between two coworkers and their SCO) and the dependent variables (i.e., Coworker A's contempt for, and perceptions of received help from, Coworker B). These estimates are comparable to the unstandardized regression coefficients in an ordinary least squares regression analysis and were used to test our study hypotheses <ref type="bibr" coords="6,339.99,286.03,94.10,7.91" target="#b83">(Snijders &amp; Kenny, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>To conduct an SRM analysis, we first calculated a null model which was used to partition the variance of contempt and Coworker A's perception of help received from Coworker B into actor, target, dyadic, and team variance (see <ref type="table" coords="6,475.11,330.03,27.23,7.91" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>).

To test Hypothesis 3, we built on the procedure outlined by <ref type="bibr" coords="6,351.51,396.03,109.50,7.91" target="#b58">Krull and MacKinnon (2001)</ref> to test the conditional indirect relationships.

We also drew on the relationship between contempt and perceptions of received help found when testing Hypothesis 2.

Finally, following the analytical procedure outlined by Lam, Van der Vegt, Walter, and Huang (2011), we used ordinary hierarchical regression analysis to examine Hypothesis 4 because both the predictor (average perception of help received from team-mates) and the outcome variable (individual sales performance) for this hypothesis were located at the same level of analysis (i.e., the individual level).</p><p>Variance partitioning. <ref type="table" coords="7,411.22,110.28,28.96,7.91" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> presents the partitioning of the variance in Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B and Coworker A's perception of the help received from Coworker B at the actor, target, dyadic, and team levels of analysis.

These findings show that the specifics of the relationship between Coworker A and Coworker B have the strongest influence on contempt for, and perceptions of help received from, another teammate.</p><p>Hypotheses tests. Hypothesis 1 predicted that SCO would moderate the effect of LMX (dis)similarity on interpersonal contempt. Statistically, we captured the LMX (dis)similarity between Coworker A and Coworker B in terms of the interaction of their LMX and then examined how SCO moderated the interactive effect of Coworker A's and Coworker B's LMX on Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B. As shown in <ref type="table" coords="7,460.68,287.56,27.57,7.91" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, the three-way interaction term of Coworker A's LMX, Coworker B's LMX, and SCO was significantly associated with Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B (see Model 3; B ϭ -.08, p Ͻ .01) after considering the control variables, main effects, and two-way interaction terms. <ref type="figure" coords="7,306.00,342.96,30.93,7.91">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the pattern of this interaction <ref type="bibr" coords="7,487.46,342.96,58.60,7.91;7,306.00,354.03,19.37,7.91" target="#b0">(Aiken &amp; West, 1991)</ref>. As expected, under the condition of high SCO (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,522.53,354.03,23.50,7.91;7,306.00,365.09,10.31,7.91">Figure  2a)</ref>, higher Coworker B's LMX was associated with lower contempt toward Coworker B from Coworker A when Coworker A's LMX was high (i.e., similarity in LMX; simple slopes test: B ϭ -.14, SE ϭ .07, p Ͻ .05). However, when Coworker A's LMX was  These results provide support for Hypothesis 1, showing that the more (less) similar the LMX experienced by two coworkers, the less (more) contempt a coworker may feel toward the other when SCO is high rather than low. Hypothesis 2 predicted that Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B would be negatively associated with Coworker A's perception of the help received from Coworker B. As shown in <ref type="table" coords="8,306.00,132.04,26.25,7.91" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, this relationship was indeed negative (B ϭ -.24, p Ͻ .01) even after incorporating several control variables, main effects, and the respective interaction terms. Hence, Hypothesis 2 received support.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 predicted that SCO would moderate the indirect relationship between LMX (dis)similarity and perceptions of received help as transmitted by contempt. Based on the analytical strategy outlined above, we inspected the conditional indirect relationship between Coworker B's LMX and Coworker A's perception of help from Coworker B at two levels of Coworker A's LMX and SCO, namely one standard deviation below and above the mean. The results are reported in the lower section of <ref type="table" coords="8,516.28,253.04,26.38,7.91" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. When SCO was higher, the indirect relationship between Coworker B's LMX and Coworker A's perception of help from Coworker B (via Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B) was positive (B ϭ .04) when Coworker A's LMX was higher (i.e., similarity in LMX); it became negative (B ϭ -.04) when Coworker A's LMX was lower (i.e., dissimilarity in LMX), as indicated by This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>both a significant Sobel test and a percentile confidence interval that excluded zero. In contrast, when SCO was lower, these indirect effects were insignificant regardless of Coworker A's LMX. Thus, Hypothesis 3 also received support.</p><p>To completely follow the spirit of balance theory, we also examined the reciprocal relationships between contempt and perceptions of received help between any two group members. We tested the dyadic reciprocations by computing within-dyad covariance divided by dyadic variance <ref type="bibr" coords="9,173.70,165.04,114.32,7.91" target="#b55">(Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,48.00,176.04,95.08,7.91" target="#b83">Snijders &amp; Kenny, 1999)</ref>. We found evidence for within-dyad reciprocity in levels of contempt (r ϭ .23, p Ͻ .05) and perceptions of received help (r ϭ .62, p Ͻ .01) between any two coworkers within any work group in our sample. These results suggest that contempt and perceptions of received help as triggered by (im)balanced LMX are reciprocated between two coworkers.</p><p>Finally, we tested Hypothesis 4, which looked at the relationship between perceptions of help received from coworkers and individual-level sales performance. Intra-class correlation and inter-rater reliability tests were conducted to identify the appropriateness of aggregating dyadic-level perceptions of received help as an individual-level construct. The results of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that there was significant between-person variance in perceptions of received help, F(127, 407) ϭ 2.71, p Ͻ .01. Table 2 also shows that 26% of the variance in perceptions of received help can be attributed to between-person differences (i.e., ICC 1 ). Furthermore, both the reliability of individuals' mean ratings (ICC 2 ϭ .73) and the median within-individual agreement index for perceived receipt of help (median r wg(j) ϭ .83) exceeded the recommended values for construct aggregation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="9,263.30,385.04,24.75,7.91;9,48.00,396.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b7">Bliese, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,72.01,396.04,120.13,7.91" target="#b51">James, Demaree, &amp; Wolf, 1984)</ref>. Based on this statistical support, we aggregated the perception of received help as an individual-level construct representing the degree to which a person on average perceives him/herself as receiving help from other team members. We then standardized individuals' sales records (at Time 2-a month after the surveys had been collected) and regressed this on the individual-level perceptions of received help (Time 1), controlling for team size and respondents' age, gender (0 ϭ male, 1 ϭ female), and organizational tenure. The results showed that the perception of received help from coworkers (B ϭ 1.91, p Ͻ .05) was positively related to sales performance. This suggests that an individual's perception of the help received from other coworkers in a work group has a positive impact on his/her actual sales performance over time. Hypothesis 4 was therefore supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>In Study 1, we argued that the actual (dis)similarity in LMX (operationalized using the interaction term of two coworkers' LMX) between a focal employee and coworker influences the former's hostile feelings toward the latter. This is because the (dis)similarity in LMX may trigger social comparison processes among the interacting dyadic members. Although research suggests that an employee is constantly comparing and evaluating his/her relative LMX standing in a team (i.e., whether his/her LMX is higher or lower than a target coworker) and that this subjective comparison is highly correlated to objectively measured LMX (dis)similarity between coworkers <ref type="bibr" coords="9,174.49,704.04,82.37,7.91" target="#b93">(Vidyarthi et al., 2010)</ref>, we did not measure and test these comparison processes in Study 1. Therefore, we also conducted Study 2 to directly measure the perceptual comparison of coworkers' LMX by directly asking employees to compare their LMX with the LMX of each of their respective coworkers in their work group (i.e., LMX social comparison; <ref type="bibr" coords="9,338.31,121.04,81.31,7.91" target="#b93">Vidyarthi et al., 2010)</ref>. We would expect the subjective comparison of LMX (LMXSC) to exert a similar influence on contempt as the objective LMX (dis)similarity explored in Study 1.</p><p>More specifically, when an employee perceives that his/her LMX is better or worse than that of a target coworker, he/she is likely to be aware of the relational imbalance in the triad (i.e., the dissimilar level of LMX between him/herself and the target coworker), thus invoking a higher level of contempt for the target. However, when the employee perceives that his/her LMX is at a similar level to that of the target coworker (i.e., medium levels of LMXSC), he/she is likely to feel less contemptuous. Hence, LMXSC may have a U-shaped relationship with contempt, in that the latter will be highest at both the lowest and highest levels of LMXSC. Furthermore, in line with Hypothesis 1, we propose that such a U-shaped link between LMXSC and contempt will be stronger for employees with higher levels of SCO because they will be more sensitive to information about their comparative standing in the work group. By contrast, for employees with low levels of SCO, we predict that LMXSC will be less related to contempt. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 5: SCO moderates the curvilinear relationship between LMXSC and contempt. That is, when SCO is high, Coworker A experiences more contempt for Coworker B at both low and high (rather than medium) levels of LMXSC. When SCO is low, Coworker A's LMXSC is less related to contempt for Coworker B.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we have examined how LMX (dis)similarity between coworkers influences their feelings of contempt for, and perceptions of help received from, each other. Our results generally support the relationships hypothesized in our model (see <ref type="figure" coords="10,306.00,359.29,29.13,7.91">Figure 1</ref>). We highlight several important findings. First of all, we have demonstrated the role of LMX (dis)similarity in the development of interpersonal contempt in two independent studies. Specifically, we found that when SCO was high (rather than low),   This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>Coworker A was more likely to feel contemptuous of Coworker B when Coworker A's LMX was higher or lower than Coworker B's (Study 1) or when Coworker A perceived his/her LMX to be higher or lower than Coworker B's (Study 2). In addition, Study 1 further demonstrated the psychological processes and performance implications of LMX (dis)similarity. We found that the interactive effect between LMX (dis)similarity and SCO indirectly, via contempt, influenced perceptions of the help received from the coworker. Furthermore, the average level of received help was positively related to the sales performance of individual employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Our findings contribute to the literature in several ways. Although LMX theory has increased our understanding of how leaders contribute to individual employees' work attitudes and performance (see <ref type="bibr" coords="11,112.40,440.04,78.08,7.91" target="#b34">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</ref>, for a review), most of the empirical studies have typically treated each dyadic LMX relationship in isolation and overlooked its potential impact on the surrounding social context <ref type="bibr" coords="11,138.63,473.04,144.16,7.91;11,48.00,484.04,40.98,7.91" target="#b76">(Schriesheim, Castro, Zhou, &amp; Yammarino, 2001)</ref>. In response to calls for research to examine the potential influences of LMX on the broader social networks of work groups <ref type="bibr" coords="11,98.84,506.04,91.75,7.91" target="#b44">(Henderson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,194.51,506.04,93.50,7.91" target="#b81">Sherony &amp; Green, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,48.00,517.04,95.89,7.91" target="#b85">Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,147.44,517.04,60.52,7.91" target="#b87">Tse et al., 2012)</ref>, we attempted to go beyond the supervisor-subordinate dyads to investigate how different levels of LMX within a work group could undermine the interactions between in-group and out-group members. Our findings suggest that LMX dissimilarity is likely to induce hostile interpersonal emotions between coworkers that may have a negative impact on their perceptions of the help received from each other. Since they are less likely to experience help and support from coworkers with different LMX levels, the ultimate consequence is decreased performance.</p><p>Second, we extend balance theory <ref type="bibr" coords="11,182.96,627.04,53.18,7.91" target="#b42">(Heider, 1958)</ref> by examining the social comparison mechanisms that provide more nuanced explanations for the dynamics of triadic relationships among Coworker A, Coworker B, and their supervisor. Specifically, in both studies, we consistently found that the SCO of individual employees played a critical role in influencing the effect of LMX (dis)similarity. More precisely, in Study 1, LMX (dis)similarity had a significant effect on contempt and perceptions of received help only for the employees who had high levels of SCO; this was because those employees were more sensitive to social comparison information about their social standing. In addition, in Study 2, we directly measured the social comparison mechanisms underlying balance theory by asking the respondents to assess their own LMX in comparison to that of every other member of the work group. Again, the influence of perceived LMX (dis)similarity was more salient for employees with high rather than low SCO. In short, these results suggest that social comparison is the key mechanism driving the triadic balance underpinned by balance theory. Therefore, we suggest that future research should adopt the theoretical lens of social comparison to understand the intricacies of triadic relationships in relation to LMX.</p><p>Third, we make a unique theoretical contribution to the LMX differentiation literature. In practice, managers usually differentiate between their subordinates to some extent and tend to provide more support and resources for high LMX members with the expectation of high performance in return <ref type="bibr" coords="11,475.18,253.03,70.85,7.91" target="#b64">(Ma &amp; Qu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,306.00,264.03,114.52,7.91" target="#b96">Wayne, Shore, &amp; Liden, 1997)</ref>. However, our research suggests that LMX dissimilarity may aggravate subordinates' performance. If managers form different relationship qualities (ranging from low to high) with different members, the objective performance of both low and high LMX members may suffer because the resulting interpersonal hostile feelings will undermine interactions between in-and out-group members. To the extent that LMX dissimilarity triggers dysfunctional emotions and interactions between coworkers, it will have a tangible negative impact on performance with the potential to inflict serious harm on organizations. By considering the relational and emotional impact of differential coworkers' LMX and the role of social comparison, our study offers new insights into the complexity and far-reaching consequences of LMX differentiation.</p></div>

Although these were examined in the pilot study, we acknowledge that the shortened scales may not be as reflective of their theoretical concepts as the original scales are, and thus inflated their measurement error for parameter estimation. Given that the roundrobin research design is laborious and requires respondents to provide ratings for each of their coworkers, we followed previous research by using shortened scales to minimize participant fatigue (see <ref type="bibr" coords="12,64.48,165.04,71.44,7.91" target="#b18">de Jong et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,137.90,165.04,60.45,7.91" target="#b59">Lam et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,200.33,165.04,87.70,7.91;12,48.00,176.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b91">Venkataramani &amp; Dalal, 2007)</ref>. Notably, our items were adapted from well-established scales that have reported strong reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" coords="12,248.04,187.04,40.00,7.91;12,48.00,198.04,34.71,7.91" target="#b18">(de Jong et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,85.93,198.04,66.02,7.91" target="#b30">Fiske et al., 2002)</ref>. Overall, we believe that the use of abbreviated scales has not resulted in any measurement concern that would invalidate our findings. Nevertheless, future studies may find it fruitful to utilize full scales to measure all of the variables tested in this study. Second, common method bias may have influenced our findings because we used self-report measures. However, several strengths of our study (e.g., the objective measure of sales performance; independent ratings of LMX; discriminant validity shown in CFAs) may outweigh such a concern. Third, the interpretation of the causal relationship may be limited due to our cross-sectional design. Future studies could use a cross-lagged panel or experimental design and include multisource data.</p><p>Finally, our samples were drawn from two organizations in China, a country whose culture is known to be highly collectivistic <ref type="bibr" coords="12,48.00,363.04,60.37,7.91" target="#b46">(Hofstede, 2001)</ref>. It is uncertain whether this might set a ceiling effect on the extent to which an employee would report his/her LMX with the supervisor and perceptions about his/her LMX compared with that of another coworker (i.e., LMXSC). This is possible because LMXSC in Study 2 and the interaction between Coworker A's and Coworker B's LMX in Study 1 were found to be unrelated to Coworker A's contempt for Coworker B. It may be of benefit to replicate the present investigation by including cultural values such as power distance or collectivism/individualism as team-level boundary conditions to examine whether or not the hypothesized relationships change in different cultural contexts.</p><p>Beyond addressing these limitations, future research could also expand the present model by considering other moderators. Besides the individual differences in SCO, other individual or contextual factors may regulate how employees respond to their coworkers' (dis)similar LMX, including personal factors such as neuroticism <ref type="bibr" coords="12,93.60,539.03,73.18,7.91" target="#b9">(Buunk et al., 2009)</ref>, self-esteem <ref type="bibr" coords="12,217.85,539.03,65.95,7.91;12,48.00,550.03,35.35,7.91" target="#b3">(Aspinwall &amp; Taylor, 1993)</ref>, and the need to belong <ref type="bibr" coords="12,182.11,550.03,105.92,7.91" target="#b6">(Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,48.00,561.03,148.66,7.91" target="#b14">Cornelis, Van Hiel, &amp; De Cremer, 2012)</ref>, and contextual features such as the degree of task interdependence between team members <ref type="bibr" coords="12,48.00,583.03,177.15,7.91" target="#b21">(Duffy, Ganster, Shaw, Johnson, &amp; Pagon, 2006)</ref>, teams' task and relationship conflict <ref type="bibr" coords="12,123.65,594.03,104.90,7.91" target="#b17">(De Dreu &amp; Weingart, 2003)</ref>, justice climate <ref type="bibr" coords="12,48.00,605.03,96.39,7.91" target="#b27">(Erdogan &amp; Bauer, 2010)</ref>, and LMX median <ref type="bibr" coords="12,224.80,605.03,63.24,7.91;12,48.00,616.03,99.83,7.91" target="#b62">(Liden, Erdogan, Wayne, &amp; Sparrowe, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Of particular interest are relational factors such as asymmetry in task dependence <ref type="bibr" coords="12,109.20,638.03,75.43,7.91" target="#b18">(de Jong et al., 2007)</ref> and expertise diversity <ref type="bibr" coords="12,270.05,638.03,17.99,7.91;12,48.00,649.03,77.16,7.91" target="#b90">(Van der Vegt et al., 2006)</ref> that convey a power difference between two individuals <ref type="bibr" coords="12,91.44,660.03,60.05,7.91" target="#b26">(Emerson, 1962)</ref>. A balance theory viewpoint would suggest that coworkers in a triadic leader-member relationship would expect equal status (i.e., LMX similarity). Deviation from this setting would motivate employees to fight for a balance in LMX status by expressing contempt in order to maintain high status and avoid a drop of status. However, legitimate power differences between two coworkers may play a role in their reactions to LMX dissimilarity. For example, the low-power individual (e.g., low skill, less experiences) may see the LMX dissimilarity as normative and legitimate in the hierarchy, making him/her conform and submit (submission rather than contempt) to the coworker who has higher LMX <ref type="bibr" coords="12,420.00,132.03,126.03,7.91;12,306.00,143.03,19.37,7.91" target="#b52">(Keltner, Gruenfeld, &amp; Anderson, 2003)</ref>. By considering the role of power-related factors, scholars can explore the differential effects of LMX dissimilarity on employees' emotional experiences.</p><p>Alternatively, future research could extend this study by considering a broader range of emotions. Balance theory suggests that while triadic imbalance causes negative interpersonal sentiments, triadic balance induces positive interpersonal emotions. We chose to focus only on the hostile emotion of contempt in the current study because the emotion literature suggests that negative emotions may have more powerful and lasting effects than positive ones (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="12,345.63,253.03,81.58,7.91" target="#b4">Basch &amp; Fisher, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,429.66,253.03,112.47,7.91;12,306.00,264.03,81.89,7.91" target="#b5">Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, &amp; Vohs, 2001)</ref>. Moreover, employees tend to pay more attention to the antecedents of negative emotions and to be more responsive to them generally <ref type="bibr" coords="12,421.24,286.03,70.05,7.91" target="#b61">(Lian et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, future research may benefit from further examining how LMX (dis)similarity shapes different types of positive and negative interpersonal emotions, thereby addressing calls for greater consideration of discrete emotions in organizational research <ref type="bibr" coords="12,478.04,330.03,68.02,7.91;12,306.00,341.03,60.23,7.91" target="#b36">(Gooty, Gavin, &amp; Ashkanasy, 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>This study has important implications for leadership and management in organizations. Our results indicate that the relationship between LMX (dis)similarity and the emotional reactions between two coworkers hinges on employees' levels of SCO. Coworkers with high levels of SCO are more likely to feel contempt for each other because they are more sensitive to their relative standing in the context of (dis)similar LMX. Since contempt decreases coworkers' perceptions of receiving help from others and eventually affects performance, it is important to promote similar levels of LMX in a team setting. Although social comparisons among high SCO coworkers may be unavoidable in most work situations, managers could enhance the positive and curtail the negative implications associated with such social comparison processes by creating a fair team context and a positive affective climate <ref type="bibr" coords="12,346.02,539.04,146.63,7.91" target="#b89">Tse, Dasborough, &amp; Ashkanasy, 2008)</ref>. Specifically, research argues that managers can reinforce the value of LMX by promoting a justice climate <ref type="bibr" coords="12,406.54,561.04,90.39,7.91" target="#b27">(Erdogan &amp; Bauer, 2010)</ref>, demonstrating fair LMX differentiation criteria (e.g., performance standards rather than subjective preferences; <ref type="bibr" coords="12,434.22,583.04,58.32,7.91" target="#b88">Tse et al., 2005)</ref>, and ensuring the criteria are consistent with the goals, demands, and norms of the work group, organization, and market <ref type="bibr" coords="12,456.87,605.04,85.30,7.91" target="#b44">(Henderson et al., 2008)</ref>. These practices can increase employees' acceptance of differential LMX quality and help them better adjust the development of LMX based on the criteria. Alternatively, organizations may provide functional human resources initiatives to reduce employees' reliance on leaders to attain valued resources, thus giving the role of LMX differentiation less influence over subordinates <ref type="bibr" coords="12,501.83,671.04,44.23,7.91;12,306.00,682.04,151.13,7.91" target="#b43">(Henderson, Liden, Glibkowski, &amp; Chaudhry, 2009)</ref>. By helping teams to manage LMX differentiation effectively, organizations may render LMX dissimilarity less likely, reducing its negative impact on coworkers' interpersonal emotions, interactions, and performance.
