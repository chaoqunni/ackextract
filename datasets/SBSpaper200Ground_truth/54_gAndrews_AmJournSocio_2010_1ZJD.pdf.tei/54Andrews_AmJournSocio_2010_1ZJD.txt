In carrying out this project, we beneﬁted from the contributions of Steve Baru, Greg Cassini, Jessica Mele, Lisa Renstrom, Julia Reitan, and Sarah Staley. Our argument and analyses were strengthened through feedback on presentations at MIT, Tufts, Harvard, and at the American Sociological Association meetings. We are grateful to Richard Hackman, Mark Moore, Robert Putnam, Sarah Soule, and the AJS reviewers for constructive criticism.
