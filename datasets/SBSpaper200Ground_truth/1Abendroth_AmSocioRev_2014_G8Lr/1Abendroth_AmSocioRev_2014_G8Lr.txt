We would like to thank Tanja van der Lippe, Ineke Maas, Andrew Penner, Carsten Sauer, Tom Snijders, and Kristin Turney for their valuable comments on earlier drafts. We benefitted from helpful suggestions from participants in the Population, Society, and Inequality Seminar at the University of California-Irvine, the 2010 “Comparing European Countries: Multi-level, Cross-time” workshop in Hamburg, and the 2011 RC28 Annual Meeting in Essex. We are also indebted to the ASR editors and anonymous reviewers for their exceptionally detailed and constructive comments and suggestions.
