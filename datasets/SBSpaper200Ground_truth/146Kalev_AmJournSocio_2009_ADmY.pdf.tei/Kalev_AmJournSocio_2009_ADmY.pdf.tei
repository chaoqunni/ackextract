<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study shows that the organization of work, particularly the structure of jobs, can sustain or erode gender and racial disadvantage. Restructuring work around team work and weaker job boundaries can improve women's and minorities' visibility and reduce stereotyping and thus should reduce their career disadvantage. Proponents of bureaucratic formalization argue, in contrast, that relaxing formal job definitions and emphasizing social relations at work will deepen ascriptive disadvantage. The reorganization of work in corporate America over the last two decades provides a test case. Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organizations, the author examines whether alleviating job segregation leads to better career outcomes for women and minorities. This study finds that when employers adopt popular team and training programs that increase cross-functional collaboration, ascriptive inequality declines. Similar programs that do not transcend job boundaries do not lead to such increases. The results point to different effects at the intersection of gender and race.</p></div>

These programs, which were adopted by at least four of every 10 medium or large-size organizations by 2000, undermine job segregation by increasing the contact and collaboration between workers and jobs from different levels and departments. Case studies show that although these programs do not eliminate gender and racial bias, they provide new opportunities for women and minorities to work with a wider range of people, to demonstrate their capabilities, to be treated as peers, and to resist devaluation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,266.14,638.64,137.04,8.55" target="#b97">(Kvande and Rasmussen 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,407.96,638.64,52.65,8.55" target="#b137">Smith 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.75,650.60,140.40,8.55" target="#b113">Ollilainen and Rothschild 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,294.79,650.60,107.62,8.55" target="#b48">Daday and Burris 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,407.05,650.60,53.65,8.55;3,149.75,148.49,20.95,8.55" target="#b138">Smith-Doerr 2004)</ref>. While all workers can benefit from such opportunities, cross-functional programs mark a larger break from women's and minorities' typical experiences. The adoption of self-directed teams and cross-training can thus have the unintended consequence of improving women's and minorities' career outcomes. In this study, I examine whether this is indeed the case.</p><p>Teams and training programs, key components of what is often called "high-performance work organization," are more than a passing fad. By 2002, between 40% and 80% of medium and large American workplaces had adopted self-directed work teams, problem-solving teams, cross-training, or job-training programs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,282.49,268.04,71.42,8.55">(Osterman 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,358.09,268.04,98.15,8.55;3,149.75,280.00,57.76,8.55" target="#b28">Black, Lynch, and Krivelyova 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,209.71,280.00,82.63,8.55" target="#b88">Kalleberg et al. 2006</ref>). Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organizations between 1980 and 2002, I analyze changes in managerial composition following the introduction of two types of team and training programs (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,272.68,315.86,20.75,8.55" target="#fig_0">fig. 1</ref>). One type has the potential to relax narrow job boundaries. This type includes self-directed work teams and cross-training, both of which increase the exposure of nonmanagerial workers from different levels to other workers, managers, and jobs across the organization. The second type includes two programs that do not have the potential to undermine career barriers caused by job segregation. Problem-solving teams usually involve workers who are already regarded as experts in their jobs. Job-training programs, which were historically promoted as a way to facilitate women's and minorities' movement into management, typically train workers in new skills for their own job or the next job up the ladder. As such, neither of these programs increases collaboration between more-and less-valued jobs and workers.</p><p>If the share of white women, black women, or black men among managers increases only after the adoption of the two programs that transcend job boundaries (self-directed teams and cross-training), this will support a relational theory of inequality <ref type="bibr" coords="3,293.64,495.18,44.92,8.55" target="#b148">(Tilly 1998</ref>) that looks at the relations between jobs as a mechanism of ascriptive stratification and a locus of remediation, a largely unexplored area in both sociology and organization research.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes at Work</head><p>The diffusion of cross-functional teams and training programs provides a unique opportunity for examining the relationship between the structure of work and the ascriptive structure of opportunities. The ideas of teams and job enrichment have been around at least since the 1930s, with Elton Mayo's human relations theory and, later, Douglas McGregor's humanistic management. The contemporary surge of these programs is usually associated with technological changes and accelerating international competition in the early 1980s. Inspired by Japanese and Western European experiences, managers and scholars viewed moving away from the Fordist model of production toward team structures and skill-development programs as an effective way to improve quality and competitiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="6,435.87,327.81,24.88,8.55;6,149.75,339.77,67.79,8.55" target="#b122">(Piore and Sabel 1984)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Team-Based Organization of Work</head><p>Few dispute the popularity of team-based work structures in American workplaces. <ref type="figure" coords="6,205.89,543.00,38.62,8.55" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the proportion of workplaces with selfdirected work teams or problem-solving teams from 1980 to 2002, based on a 2002 retrospective survey of a stratified random sample of 810 medium and large American establishments. The proportions are based on the number of surveyed workplaces that existed in each year. The sample represents older and more stable work establishments, and the findings might be more pronounced in a sample of younger firms. Selfdirected work teams were adopted by about 7% of the organizations that existed in the early 1980s, compared to roughly 35% of the organizations existing in 2002.

If cross-training increases the visibility of women's and minorities' capabilities, then the introduction of these programs may improve their chances to access managerial jobs. Job training.-Job training provides workers with skills required for performing their job or the next job up the ladder. To the extent that, due to pre-labor market processes, women and minorities have lower skill levels than white men, receiving job training from their employers can help them obtain better jobs with better career prospects. This logic stood behind some of the early adoptions of these programs. Affirmative action regulations, as established in executive orders 10925 and 11246, encourage employers to take active steps to promote the "full realization of equal opportunity" of historically disadvantaged groups. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,363.40,446.38,2.99,4.70">4</ref> The adoption of skilltraining programs has been perceived as an effective means for generating pools of women and minority employees qualified for management jobs <ref type="bibr" coords="12,149.75,483.23,187.89,8.55">(U.S. Glass Ceiling Commission 1995, p. 47;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,340.73,483.23,115.71,8.55" target="#b77">Holzer and Neumark 1998)</ref>.

If this is the case, the adoption of job-training programs will not bring more women and blacks into management. Summary I examine changes in the shares of women and minorities in management following the adoption of two types of team and training programs. Based on a structural relational approach to stratification that views job segregation as a mechanism of ascriptive inequality, I expect those programs that counteract job segregation-self-directed teams and cross-trainingto be followed by an increase in managerial diversity. To the extent that white men's higher share of managerial jobs is a result of sex-or racebased privilege, programs that reduce ascription are likely to reduce white men's advantage <ref type="bibr" coords="13,226.79,483.23,148.94,8.55">(Reskin and McBrier 2000, p. 210)</ref>. Because problemsolving teams and formal job training do not alter the organization of jobs, I do not expect their adoption to lead to similar increases in managerial diversity. Thus, I hypothesize that the adoption of self-directed work teams and cross-training programs will be associated with subsequent increases in the proportions of white women, black women, and black men and a decline in the proportion of white men among managers.</p><p>A caveat to this hypothesis is related to the differences between the mechanisms shaping gender and racial inequality at work. First, white women are, on average, more educated than blacks and better positioned in organizations <ref type="bibr" coords="13,222.29,602.78,155.74,8.55" target="#b22">(Bell, Nkomo, and Hammond 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,381.61,602.78,79.03,8.55;13,149.75,614.73,80.28,8.55">Altonji and Blank 1999, pp. 3151-55)</ref>; consequently, white women may be more likely to make use of their new career resources and acquire management positions. Second, research shows that racial diversity, to a greater extent than gender diversity, can have a negative impact on group processes, such as communication and integration <ref type="bibr" coords="14,290.32,148.49,108.22,8.55" target="#b20">(Baugh and Graen 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,402.58,148.49,58.02,8.55;14,149.75,160.55,96.11,8.55">Williams and O'Reilly 1998, p. 115;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,249.94,160.55,115.80,8.55" target="#b150">Townsend and Scott 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,369.83,160.55,55.68,8.55" target="#b155">Vallas 2003b)</ref>; hence, racial boundaries may be slower to change than gender boundaries.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA AND METHODS</head><p>I analyze unique longitudinal data on annual measures of the workforce composition and work practices of 810 establishments to estimate changes in the proportions of managers who are white men, white women, black women, and black men following the adoption of team and training programs between 1980 and 2002.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>The data set was assembled from two main sources: annual reports on establishments' workforce composition from 1980 to 2002 and an original survey of these same establishments' work and personnel structures. The data collection was conducted in collaboration with Frank Dobbin and was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Russell Sage Foundation.</p><p>The workforce composition data come from annual EEO-1 reports submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by all private-sector employers with more than 100 employees and government contractors with more than 50 employees and $50,000 worth of contracts. 6 These reports detail the sex, racial, and ethnic composition of the workforce in nine broad occupational categories. These data were obtained for research purposes from the EEOC under an Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) agreement. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,317.42,499.18,2.99,4.70">7</ref> The broad occupational categories used by the EEOC obscure segregation within management, where women and minorities are often concentrated in lower-level positions. Accordingly, my analysis examines the entrance of women and minorities at least to lower-level managerial ranks, but not mobility within management. 8 Still, EEO-1 reports provide the best available data for studying long-term change in organizations' workforce composition (see <ref type="bibr" coords="18,247.78,184.36,89.58,8.55" target="#b131">Robinson et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>I drew a random sample of establishments from the EEO-1 data for the year 1999 (the latest year of data available at the time of sampling). The sample was stratified by the number of years the establishment appeared in the EEO-1 data to ensure a sufficient longitudinal perspective as well as variation in the establishments' age. Half of the establishments had to have been in the data at least since 1992 and half since 1980. The sample was also stratified by size, with 35% of the establishments having less than 500 employees, and by industry, into the following categories: food, chemical, computer, and transportation equipment manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and insurance, business, and health services. The sampling unit was an establishment (that is, a single location of a firm or a firm with a single location), and only one establishment per parent firm was sampled.</p><p>Before composing the survey instrument, I examined the wording and findings of other employment surveys conducted in the last decade (in particular, <ref type="bibr" coords="18,363.60,375.63,50.01,8.55" target="#b92">Kelly 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,418.59,375.63,42.03,8.55;18,149.75,387.59,20.97,8.55">Osterman 2000)</ref>, as well as information about changes in work organization obtained from in-person interviews with human resources managers that I conducted in <ref type="bibr" coords="18,277.58,411.50,17.92,8.55">.

Reclassification is most likely to have occurred in the 1970s, the early years of the EEO-1 reporting requirement. Nonetheless, I excluded all organization-year cells in which there was a large change in the number of women or blacks in management (larger than 95% of the cases), and results were not affected. This is consistent with evidence that women's and minorities' entrance to management does represent a significant, if small, change in their status <ref type="bibr" coords="18,434.34,554.96,26.29,7.27;18,149.75,564.42,17.84,7.27" target="#b83">(Jacobs 1992)</ref>. 9 I examined response bias using logistic regression with industry, establishment status (headquarters, subunit, or stand-alone organization), size, government contract status, and managerial composition (results are available upon request). Responding establishments were larger and had a larger proportion of white men in their managerial ranks than nonresponding organizations. Size is included in the models, as well as the composition of top management teams. All industries were equally likely to participate in the survey, excluding establishments from the business services industry, which were less likely to participate. The proportion of each industry in the final sample varies little, between 9.66% and 12.80%. tenure of 11 years. Interviewees were asked whether a series of programs related to the organization of work had ever been adopted in their establishment, in what years they were first adopted, and whether they were still in place. The survey included similar questions about related personnel practices and other organizational characteristics that are included as control variables in this analysis. When the respondents did not know the year in which certain programs were adopted, they were sent a list of the unanswered questions, so they could answer them after consulting their records or colleagues. For three of the four programs examined here, 4% or less of the respondents did not know the years of adoption. For job-training programs this number was 7%. All missing values were imputed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with industry, establishment age, and type of establishment as covariates. The results remain robust when imputed data for each variable are excluded.</p><p>Upon completion of the phone interviews, I matched the survey data for each establishment with the corresponding annual EEO-1 records and removed all identifying information from the data set to ensure confidentiality. Data on national, state, and industry labor market characteristics were added from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) sources. The final data set used in this analysis contains 810 cases and 14,693 establishment-years, with a median of 23 years of data for each establishment. 10 Dependent Variable-Managerial Diversity</p><p>The outcome variables are the proportions of white men, white women, black women, and black men among managers in an establishment, as calculated from the EEO-1 data. Between 1980 and 2002 the share of white men among managers declined from 75% to 62%, while white women's share grew from 19% to 26%, black women's from less than 1% to 2%, and black men's from 2.4% to 3.1% (see <ref type="figure" coords="19,371.48,497.37,19.25,8.55" target="#fig_3">fig. 4</ref>). Similar trends are found in the overall EEO-1 data set and in data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the BLS, but those other data sets show larger gains for women and blacks because they describe a dynamic population, rather than the stable set of firms in my sample, and they also include nonprofits and government agencies.</p><p>Because there are large differences in the absolute magnitude of the change in the proportions across groups, I use the log odds of each group's being in management as dependent variables <ref type="bibr" coords="19,344.48,593.81,65.52,8.55">(Fox 1997, p. 78</ref>). Using log proportion rather than log odds does not alter the results, but the distribution of log odds is closer to normal. 11</p><p>Independent Variables-the Reorganization of Work I use four variables to measure different aspects of the reorganization of work: self-directed work teams, problem-solving teams, cross-training, and formal job training (this last variable is defined as other than on-thejob training). The variables are based on answers to survey questions pertaining to the adoption of these programs and the years in which they operated in the core job. The questions pertained to the core job category to maintain consistency in measuring across establishments and in relation to other programs and policies involved in the analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="21,387.77,291.95,68.65,8.55" target="#b114">(Osterman 1994)</ref>, and also to ensure that the programs are not limited to one or two minor jobs. The variables are binary, coded 1 in every establishment-year cell since the year of adoption of each program and 0 before the program is adopted and after it is revoked, if relevant, or if it has never been adopted.</p><p>The median year of adoption for self-directed work teams is 1992, and overall 18% of the establishment-year cells in my data had these teams by 2002. For problem-solving teams the median year of adoption is 1991, and 30% of the establishment-year cells in my data had them by 2002. Both cross-training and job-training programs have 1985 as the median year of adoption. About 57% of the establishment-year cells in my data had cross-training programs and 50% had job-training programs by 2002.</p><p>All the independent variables in the analysis are measured annually in the year before the dependent variables. <ref type="table" coords="21,335.29,447.36,33.52,8.55" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> presents the means, standard deviations, definitions, and data sources for all variables used in the analysis.</p></div>

The results of my analysis are robust to different strategies for substituting zeros. I chose the one that kept the distribution unimodal and closest to normal. I also included a dummy variable that equals 1 when there are no managers from the focal group. The results are also not sensitive to whether this variable is included. evaluations, and organizational downsizing are measured as binary variables, based on survey data. The variable for work/family accommodations counts four elements: paid maternity leave, paid paternity leave, a policy allowing flextime, and top-management support for work/family programs. The percentage of managerial jobs is measured using EEO-1 data on the number of managerial employees. Organizational structures.-Personnel policies are measured using three variables, based on survey data. First is a variable counting the presence of eight policies formalizing HR decisions: hiring, promotion, and discharge guidelines, job descriptions, promotion ladders, performance evaluations, pay-grade systems, and internal job posting. Second is a binary variable denoting the presence of an annual affirmative action plan. Last is a count of five diversity programs, including diversity training, evaluations, staff, and mentoring and networking. Unionization is measured as a binary variable using survey data. Establishment size is the number of employees in the establishment, based on the EEO-1 data.</p><p>Workforce demography.-The composition of top managerial ranks is measured as the percentages of women and blacks in the top 10 executive positions, based on survey data. Interviewees were asked about the percentages at 10-year intervals, and values for intervening years were interpolated. The composition of the establishment's internal labor pool is measured as the proportion of the focal group among nonmanagerial workers, based on the EEO-1 reports. The composition of the establishment's external labor pool is measured using annual data from the CPS on the proportion of each demographic group among the industry and state labor forces. Industry employment variables are logged.</p><p>Organizational environment.-Organizations' legal environment is measured in several ways. To measure managers' awareness of the legal environment, I use a binary variable on the presence of in-house legal counsel, based on the survey data. Another binary variable, based on EEO-1 data, denotes whether the establishment is a government contractor subject to affirmative action regulations. Finally, a count variable, based on survey data, counts the establishment's experience with three types of antidiscrimination enforcement: EEOC charges, Title VII lawsuits, and affirmative action compliance reviews. Unemployment is measured as the yearly state unemployment rate and industry size as total annual industry employment. Both are based on data from the BLS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>My analysis provides strong support for the argument that restructuring work to weaken job segregation improves the access of women and minorities to management. Both self-directed work teams and cross-training programs have significant positive effects on the odds that managers are white women, black women, and black men and a negative effect on white men's odds of being in management. In contrast, programs that do not expand workers' opportunities to transcend job boundaries-problem-solving teams and job training-do not have these effects. The results also indicate that racial barriers are more resistant to change than are gender barriers. The effect of self-directed teams on black women is significantly smaller than that on white women, and problem-solving teams have a negative effect on black men's and black women's shares in management. Below I discuss the findings in greater detail. <ref type="table" coords="26,159.71,583.85,32.47,8.55" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> includes the results of the full model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Team-Based Work</head><p>The results presented in table 2 show that the adoption of self-directed teams by an establishment has a significant positive effect on the shares of women and minorities among managers of that establishment. After the adoption of self-directed work teams, the odds that managers are white men decline by an average of 8%, the odds for white women increase by an average of 9%, and those for black women and black men increase by about 3.5% and 5%, respectively. A chi-squared test indicates that the estimated effect of self-directed teams on white women is significantly larger than the estimated effect on black women (x 2 p 3.98; df p 1; P ! .046), but not significantly larger than the effect on black men (x 2 p 1.86; df p 1; P ! .173).</p><p>In contrast to self-directed work teams, the adoption of problem-solving teams is not followed by increased diversity; rather, it lowers the odds that managers are black women by 3% and that managers are black men by 6%. The magnitude of these effects is comparable to the positive effects of self-directed work teams. Does this mean that when both programs are adopted, there will be no change in the proportions of black men and women in management, or is there an added value of having both programs in place? To examine this question, in a separate model, I included an interaction term for self-directed work teams and problem-solving teams. The coefficients for the interaction term indicated that having both these programs at the same time has a weak positive effect on black women, significant only at the 10% level of confidence (b p 0.053; SE p 0.029), and no effect on black men (b p 0.024; SE p 0.031). In other words, there is no evidence of an added value from having both types of programs at the same time. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,268.06,613.75,5.98,4.70">16</ref> Problem-solving teams, which often include experts and higher-ranking workers, who are typically white and male, may improve the career chances of other workers (white men or women) and thereby deepen the disadvantage of black workers.

To evaluate this 2.5% change in context we can look at the bottom line in table 3, which summarizes the percentage change in the share of each group among managers between 1980 and 2002. The proportion of white men among managers declined in this period by 17%, from 75% to 62%. To give another example, the proportion of white women among managers is estimated to increase by 5.6% due to the adoption of self-directed work teams, while overall the share of white women among managers increased by 37% (from 19% to 26%) between 1980 and 2002. Self-directed work teams and cross-training programs erode job segregation, but if these programs are implemented in highly segregated organizations, or if women and minorities are excluded from participating, the programs might not change these groups' career opportunities. The analysis cannot account for variation in women's and minorities' participation (data on their participation were not collected), and so the estimated effects we observe may include cases where these programs are demographically homogeneous and may thus underestimate the extent to which women and minorities benefit from participation.</p></div>

The parallel decline in white men's odds suggests that women's work/family conflict serves as a source of advantage for white men.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confounding Factors and Reverse Causality</head><p>The model specification, with fixed effects for each establishment and year, accounts for two possible sources of bias. First, the establishment fixed effects account for stable unobserved heterogeneity that might affect the outcomes. For example, adopters may have a change-oriented organizational culture or may be concentrated in progressive industries or states and so may be more likely to both adopt new programs and be diversity-friendly. Second, the inclusion of a dummy variable for each year accounts for unmeasured heterogeneity that is correlated with time and affects all organizations alike, such as changes in societal attitudes, legal environment, or managerial fads.</p><p>Time-varying organization-specific exogenous changes.-The fixedeffects specification by itself does not rule out the possibility that time-varying organization-specific exogenous changes-for example, new leadership or a decline in profits-may affect both the organization of work and the access of women and blacks to management. I try to rule out spuriousness due to such unobserved heterogeneity in three ways. The first way is through the research design: all four programs I examine are often adopted as part of what is called "high-performance reorganization" <ref type="bibr" coords="35,149.75,220.22,91.13,8.55" target="#b41">(Cappelli et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="35,244.91,220.22,67.01,8.55">Osterman 2000)</ref>. That only two of the four innovations examined here show positive effects on managerial diversity increases my confidence that these effects are not caused by a latent factor. For example, if the real factor that affected management diversity was the arrival of a new CEO infatuated with progressive management programs, we would expect to see positive effects for all four programs. Second, the effects of cross-functional team and training programs are observed despite the inclusion of many related organizational innovations, such as management training, peer reviews, work/family accommodations, and diversity efforts (see <ref type="table" coords="35,288.10,327.81,28.32,8.55" target="#tab_2">table 2</ref>). Third, the models may still be subject to omitted variable bias, if an unmeasured factor led both to the adoption of cross-functional programs and to changes in management diversity. To test for omitted variable bias, I performed an additional analysis (results are available upon request) in which I added binary variables as proxies for the occurrence of unmeasured events (such as financial or technological changes) before the adoption of each program. I performed this sensitivity analysis with proxy events assumed to occur two and three years prior to the adoption of each of the four team and training programs examined here, in models parallel to those in table 2. If adding a proxy variable for an event occurring before, say, the adoption of self-directed work teams caused the coefficients for these teams to decline in size or become nonsignificant, and the proxy variable showed significant effects in the same direction as the original coefficients, the results for these teams might be spurious <ref type="bibr" coords="35,334.42,495.18,63.57,8.55" target="#b23">(Bennear 2007)</ref>. As expected, however, the coefficients of interest and the standard errors remained robust to the inclusion of these proxy variables, and the proxy variables did not produce significant coefficients. These analyses also suggest that the observed relationship between the reorganization of work and managerial diversity is not spurious.</p><p>Reverse causality.-If adopters of cross-functional team and training programs are more diverse firms, there is a possibility of reverse causality. Appendix <ref type="figure" coords="35,195.75,590.82,40.96,8.55" target="#fig_0">figure A1</ref> shows the presence of each of the four team and training programs in workplaces with different workforce composition. For example, the first quartile includes organizations that are located in the bottom 25% of the distribution in terms of the proportion of white women, black women, or black men in their workforce-these are the least diverse organizations. The figure illustrates that team and training programs are present in organizations with different levels of diversity and are not concentrated in the more diverse firms. For example, selfdirected work teams are about equally present in organizations in the first and fourth quartiles of %white women in their workforces and the second and fourth quartiles of %black women, while cross-training programs are more highly concentrated in workplaces with the lowest proportions of white and black women and about equally present across the distribution of the proportions of black men. The heterogeneous patterns shown in figure A1 suggest that the effects of self-directed work teams and crosstraining programs are unlikely to be a reflection of their concentration in firms with higher initial shares of women and minority workers. Finally, to buttress our confidence that the results do not reflect previous levels of diversity, I repeated the multivariate analysis presented in table 2, this time including the proportion of each group in management in the year of adoption as an independent variable (the proportion of each group in nonmanagement positions is already included in the models). This variable absorbs the variance in the outcome that comes from earlier levels of diversity. The results of that analysis (available upon request) are not significantly different from the results reported here.</p><p>Taken together, the fixed-effects specifications, the research design, the range of control variables, and the various additional analyses reported here strengthen my confidence in the conclusions about the effects of crossfunctional team and training programs on the shares of women and minorities in management.</p></div>

While the question of how to reduce the channeling of women and minorities into segregated jobs has been keeping scholars busy, I focus on what happens when the segregated structure of jobs is ameliorated. If job segregation reinforces ascription, then reorganizing work around teams and more porous job boundaries should improve career outcomes for women and minorities. This type of reor-ganization has become popular in the United States over the last quarter century.</p><p>Analyzing data on changes in the organization of work and managerial composition from 1980 to 2002 in a national sample of more than 800 workplaces, I find that the introduction of cross-functional work programs-self-directed teams and cross-training-leads to increases in the shares of women and minorities in management. These results are not merely due to the churning of managerial positions associated with organizational change: team and training programs that do not allow women and minorities to transcend job boundaries do not have these effects.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3"> Personal communication, June 15, 2001.   </note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">Excluded employers, such as state and local governments, schools, and colleges, provide different reports (see the EEOC's "Instructions for Standard Form 100 (EEO-1)," available at http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/jobpat/e1instruct.html[accessed April 19,  2004]). 7 EEO-1 data were obtained for 1971-2002. The 1970s were not included here because cross-functional work arrangements as such began their diffusion in the early to mid-1980s, with high-profile employers such as GM, Xerox, and Corning transforming their organization of work. The in-person interviews I conducted in 2000-2001 confirm that when employers talk about cross-training before the 1980s, they are referring to it as part of executive programs.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="10">For 15 cases, EEO-1 data were usable for only four years or less. For an additional eight cases, the survey data were unusable. These cases are excluded from the analysis.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="14">Using the Huber-White robust standard errors did not change the results of the analysis.15  Available in Stata using the xtregar procedure.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="16">Coefficients of the interaction analysis for white men and women also show no significant effects. Full results are available upon request.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="18">This criticism is usually directed at affirmative action plans and is less relevant for cross-functional work programs, which are not adopted as part of employers' efforts to comply with antidiscrimination regulations.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="20">An alternative explanation for the negative effect of self-directed teams on the odds that managers are white men is that white male managers may voluntarily leave after the adoption of these programs, which may entail a change in management style. If voluntary resignation is the mechanism, this pattern will be less pronounced in periods of high unemployment. I examined this possibility by reanalyzing the data, adding to the model measures for an interaction between the presence of self-directed teams and state unemployment rates. None of the interaction coefficients was significant (for white men the coefficient is 0.006; SE p 0.007), and so the analysis does not support the voluntary exit hypothesis. Full results are available upon request. 21 I thank an anonymous reviewer for this point.</note>
