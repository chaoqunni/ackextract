Funding for the California Parole Study is from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ Award 2005-U-CX-026). Additional support was provided by the UCI Center for Evidence-Based Corrections and the Institute for Governmental Affairs at the University of California, Davis. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), and particularly the Division of Adult Parole Operations, the Office of Research, and the Board of Parole Hearings, provided access to administrative data. Graduate students at the University of California–Davis and the University of California–Irvine assisted in data collection and analysis, including Teresa Casey, Ryan Fischer, Demetra Kalogrides, Danielle Rudes, Julie Siebens, and Monica Williams. Colleagues Diane Felmlee, Eric Grodsky, John Hipp, Brad Jones, Xiaoling Shu, and Susan Turner provided assistance with the research design and methodology. Valerie Jenness, Tom Beamish, and John Sutton provided valuable feedback on the draft manuscript, as did the Editor-in-Chief of Criminology and the anonymous reviewers.
