<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A long history of research has indicated that neighborhood poverty increases youth's risk taking and delinquency. This literature predominantly has treated neighborhoods as independent of their surroundings despite rapidly growing ecological evidence on the geographic clustering of crime that suggests otherwise. This study proposes that to understand neighborhood effects, investigating youth's wider surroundings holds theoretical and empirical value. By revisiting longitudinal data on more than 1500 lowincome youth who participated in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) randomized intervention, this article explores the importance of extended neighborhoods (neighborhoods and surroundings) and different concentrated disadvantage configurations in shaping gender differences in risk taking and delinquency. The results from twostage, least-squares analyses suggest that the extended neighborhoods matter and they matter differently by gender. Among girls, extended neighborhoods without concentrated disadvantage were associated with lower risk-taking prevalence than extended neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage. In contrast, among boys, localized concentration of disadvantage was associated with the highest prevalence of risk taking and delinquency. Interactions between the immediate and surrounding neighborhoods were similarly associated with differential opportunity and social disorganization mediators. Among the more critical potential mediators of the link between localized</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOVING TO OPPORTUNITY AND GENDER</head><p>In the early 1990s, the U.S. Congress funded the MTO program, a randomized intervention spanning five U.S. cities, with the goal of spatially deconcentrating risk factors among public housing residents of poor inner-city neighborhoods. The program assisted hundreds of families to move to low-poverty neighborhoods. Several years after the intervention, researchers found that female youth assigned to the low-poverty experimental group were engaged in less risky behavior than their control counterparts who stayed behind or moved at will. However, male youth in the experimental group were engaged in more risky behavior and other problematic behavior, and they were more likely to be arrested for property crimes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.34,610.44,144.58,9.21" target="#b40">(Kling, Liebman, and Katz, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,317.87,610.44,109.28,9.21;3,40.37,60.68,22.41,9.21" target="#b41">Kling, Ludwig, and Katz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,65.89,60.68,89.88,9.21" target="#b77">Sciandra et al., 2013)</ref>. Other studies also similarly found that decreased neighborhood disadvantage increased the gender gap in violence <ref type="bibr" coords="3,279.84,72.63,143.09,9.21" target="#b89">(Zimmerman and Messner, 2010)</ref> and increased boys' problem behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="3,205.31,84.58,138.27,9.21" target="#b19">(Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,345.68,84.58,77.24,9.21;3,40.37,96.54,64.48,9.21" target="#b31">Hagan, Gillis, and Simpson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,107.36,96.54,94.93,9.21" target="#b38">Jensen and Eve, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,204.79,96.54,83.06,9.21" target="#b46">Ludwig et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To make sense of the puzzling effects on boys, ideas of relative deprivation and competitive advantage have been proposed. For instance, after finding themselves performing worse in schools than their new peers, boys may seek to boost their status in alternative ways, such as risk taking and delinquency <ref type="bibr" coords="3,217.42,144.36,134.45,9.21" target="#b41">(Kling, Ludwig, and Katz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,353.82,144.36,64.73,9.21" target="#b58">Orr et al., 2003)</ref>. Although these ideas are important, they have not been tested against a more fundamental question: Have we perhaps missed something critical about the broader geographic picture of neighborhood effects? This article addresses this question by exploring the extent to which the environment surrounding boys' and girls' neighborhood of residence may modify the effect of the immediate neighborhood and explain the puzzling gender differences in the MTO.</p><p>Understanding gender difference in delinquency and risky behavior is an important task for researchers and policy makers. Although juvenile arrests are declining, juvenile courts handled approximately 1.4 million delinquency cases in 2010 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,350.23,251.96,72.70,9.21;3,40.37,263.92,62.69,9.21" target="#b65">(Puzanchera and Robson, 2014)</ref> and the male juvenile arrest rate remained consistently more than double the female rate. Yet, the gender gap in neighborhood effects remains little understood <ref type="bibr" coords="3,40.37,287.82,110.35,9.21" target="#b88">(Zahn and Browne, 2009)</ref>. Differential patterns of time and space use, adult control, social support, and delinquent peers (discussed later in this article) may protect girls more than boys against street risks and support them in accessing resources when they move to improved neighborhoods <ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.96,323.69,61.13,9.21" target="#b10">(Broidy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,226.57,323.69,134.42,9.21" target="#b27">Gager, Cooney, and Call, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,363.48,323.69,59.48,9.21;3,40.37,335.65,83.50,9.21" target="#b31">Hagan, Gillis, and Simpson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,126.62,335.65,124.38,9.21" target="#b33">Heimer and DeCoster, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,253.73,335.65,169.22,9.21" target="#b43">Kroneman, Loeber, and Hipwell, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,40.37,347.60,167.40,9.21" target="#b48">McCarthy, Felmlee, and Hagan, 2004)</ref>. Such patterns may be magnified when the surrounding neighborhood context is consistent with the residential neighborhood.</p><p>The current article, therefore, explores how gender moderates extended neighborhood effects on youth behavior and delves deeper into key mediators of such effects related to two major conceptual perspectives: social disorganization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,309.85,395.42,113.06,9.21;3,40.37,407.38,100.42,9.21" target="#b74">(Sampson, Morenoff, and Gannon-Rowley, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,144.35,407.38,107.77,9.21" target="#b79">Shaw and McKay, 1942)</ref> and differential opportunity <ref type="bibr" coords="3,381.99,407.38,40.95,9.21;3,40.37,419.33,73.04,9.21" target="#b21">(Cloward and Ohlin, 1960)</ref>. By making the case that protective factors and criminogenic risk in nearby areas (e.g., collective efficacy or illegitimate opportunities) may affect offending even if absent in the immediate neighborhood <ref type="bibr" coords="3,271.96,443.24,150.99,9.21;3,40.37,455.20,21.90,9.21" target="#b28">(Graif, Gladfelter, and Matthews, 2014)</ref>, the current study examines neighborhood mediators through an extended spatial perspective.</p><p>In brief, this article contributes to the neighborhood effects literature by exploring for the first time the extended neighborhood environment of risk-taking behavior and revisits the MTO youth data to understand gender moderation of extended neighborhood effects on risk taking and delinquency. The analytical approach focuses on a similar age group and follow-up period as previous analyses of the MTO. It builds on established strategies in this research with respect to measuring the dependent variables and analytic modeling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,108.15,550.84,141.08,9.21">Kling, Leibman, and Katz, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,252.26,550.84,134.99,9.21" target="#b41">Kling, Ludwig, and Katz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,390.30,550.84,32.66,9.21;3,40.37,562.79,69.48,9.21" target="#b45">Ludwig and Kling, 2007)</ref>. However, in contrast to previous work (also <ref type="bibr" coords="3,309.79,562.79,83.94,9.21" target="#b44">Ludwig et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,396.35,562.79,22.13,9.21;3,40.37,574.75,63.92,9.21" target="#b77">Sciandra et al., 2013)</ref>, this study applies a spatially explicit approach to explore the role that the surrounding neighborhood environments may play in modifying the immediate neighborhood effects. Also, this article contributes to the literature by investigating how gender moderates extended neighborhoods' association with different possible underlying mediators. This extended spatial approach seeks to contribute new insights on the relevance of neighborhoods and spatial interactions for youth development and crime-control policies.</p></div>

The predominant framework explaining the connection between concentrated poverty and crime is social disorganization <ref type="bibr" coords="4,330.38,188.03,54.73,9.21" target="#b66">(Reiss, 1951;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,387.84,188.03,39.30,9.21;4,44.60,199.98,77.35,9.21" target="#b72">Sampson and Groves, 1989)</ref>. The MTO program was motivated by this important line of work, including William Julius <ref type="bibr" coords="4,141.95,211.94,66.94,9.21" target="#b87">Wilson's (1987)</ref> influential ideas on the "truly disadvantaged."

Institutional ties and support systems are reflected in a neighborhood's density of organizations, jobs, and access to, and quality of, services. Weak institutional support such as ineffective police response can increase distrust in the police and, ultimately, crime <ref type="bibr" coords="4,297.98,403.22,66.28,9.21" target="#b64">(Putnam, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,368.01,403.22,59.11,9.21;4,44.60,415.18,55.37,9.21" target="#b70">Sampson and Graif, 2009a)</ref>. Informal social ties refer to local friendships and kin and are presumed to protect against crime. However, work on differential association and differential social organization <ref type="bibr" coords="4,101.40,439.09,80.32,9.21" target="#b81">(Sutherland, 1947)</ref> has underscored the dual role of informal ties-they can both impede and foster crime. If delinquency is higher in disadvantaged neighborhoods, then youth's prevalence of associations with delinquent peers and level of exposure to definitions favorable to crime may be higher than in other neighborhoods.

Markers of both social and physical disorder, such as people drinking and hanging out on the streets, graffiti, abandoned buildings, and "broken windows," are thought to attract predatory crime by signaling low neighborhood social control to potential offenders <ref type="bibr" coords="4,44.60,558.64,147.74,9.21" target="#b75">(Sampson and Raudenbush, 1999)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIFFERENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES</head><p>An alternative line of thought leads to expectations that moving poor, low-income teens from highly disadvantaged neighborhoods to lower disadvantaged neighborhoods leads to more rather than less risk-taking behavior and delinquency as a result of processes closely related to views on routine activities, differential opportunity, and relative deprivation. First, opportunities for illegitimate gains may increase in the improved neighborhoods. As <ref type="bibr" coords="5,55.01,138.21,115.26,9.21" target="#b22">Cohen and Felson's (1979)</ref> routine activity theory suggests, crime increases when motivated offenders meet desirable targets under conditions of low guardianship. Desirable targets, such as valuables to steal or customers to sell drugs to, will be more present in neighborhoods of lower disadvantage. Low initial crime rates may contribute to lower initial alertness, unlocked doors, and unguarded possessions.</p><p>Second, when moving to low-disadvantage neighborhoods, offending motivation among poor low-income youth may be increased by strain as a result of relative deprivation. This effect can result from the frustration of falling to the bottom of the status hierarchy relative to their advantaged neighbors or from higher visibility of opportunities blocked, weakening youth's belief in their legitimate opportunities for success <ref type="bibr" coords="5,381.98,245.81,40.96,9.21;5,40.38,257.77,73.37,9.21" target="#b21">(Cloward and Ohlin, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,117.51,257.77,60.80,9.21" target="#b50">Merton, 1938)</ref>.

This approach builds on previous work by applying a geographically extended scale to define neighborhood categories and moves the discussion further by exploring how such types of concentrated disadvantage differentially impact behavior. Within an extended neighborhood context, effects of concentrated disadvantage in one's immediate neighborhood may be amplified by concentrated disadvantage in nearby neighborhoods, through spillovers of nearby social disorganization mediators such as weakened collective efficacy and increased crime rate. Proximity to disadvantage, gangs, and drug users has been shown to affect social interactions in nearby neighborhoods, whether middle class <ref type="bibr" coords="6,144.00,402.96,101.27,9.21" target="#b61">(Pattillo-McCoy, 1999)</ref> or similarly disadvantaged, gang-ridden areas <ref type="bibr" coords="6,70.48,414.92,176.07,9.21" target="#b60">(Papachristos, Hureau, and Braga, 2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent Variables</head><p>The two main dependent variables are summary scales. The delinquency scale is the fraction of a youth's positive responses to nine questions about 1) carrying a hand gun such as a firearm other than a rifle or shotgun; 2) belonging to a gang; 3) purposefully damaging or destroying property; 4) stealing something worth less than $50; 5) stealing something worth $50 or more; 6) committing other property crimes such as fencing, receiving, possessing, or selling stolen property or cheating someone by selling them something that was worthless or worth much less than what the youth said it was; 7) attacking someone with the intention of hurting him or her or having a situation end up in serious fight or assault; 8) selling or helping sell marijuana, hashish, or other drugs such as heroin, cocaine, or LSD; and 9) being arrested by the police or taken into custody for an illegal or delinquent offense, not including minor traffic violations. Each item of the composite scale takes a value of "1" if the youth reported at least one occurrence in the past 12 months and "0" for none. Of all youth, 28 percent reported at least one delinquent activity in the past year. 2 The prevalence of each of these activities for girls varies from less than 1 percent for gang membership to almost 11 percent for assault. For boys, it varies from 3 percent for gang membership or theft to 21 percent for arrest (see table S.1 in the online supporting information). <ref type="bibr" coords="10,181.09,268.16,6.48,6.44">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,187.57,268.16,3.24,6.44">4</ref> The risky behavior scale is a fraction of a youth's positive responses to four questions about 1) alcohol use, 2) cigarette smoking, and 3) marijuana use, all in the past 30 days, as well as 4) ever having given birth or fathered a child. Of all youth, 43 percent reported at least one risky behavior. Of all female youth, 10 percent smoked marijuana, 17 percent drank alcohol, 17 percent smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days, and 32 percent had given birth to a child. Of all male youth, 18 percent smoked marijuana, 21 percent drank alcohol, 22 percent smoked cigarettes, and 15 percent ever fathered a child.

Normalized versions of each scale are produced by subtracting the gender-specific control mean from each observation before dividing by the standard deviation of the control group. The index scales are calculated as an equally weighted average of the normalized components.

Disadvantage is a composite function of Decennial Census measures of poverty rate, unemployment rate, proportion of female-headed households with children, and proportion of households that receive public assistance. It is based on a regression factor score by weighing each item according to its loadings in a Varimax rotated solution of a principal component analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="11,224.73,239.83,176.10,9.21" target="#b76">(Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Several problems emerge when using decennial census data in calculating composite scales. First, the factor loads may not be uniform enough to produce comparable results across time. To address this issue, the disadvantage scores were calculated for each tract year after pooling the 1990 and 2000 data together. Second, census years may not properly represent the characteristics of the tracts during noncensus years. To address this issue, for each intercensal or postcensal year, scores were calculated with linear interpolation or extrapolation. NCDB normalizations of the census measures were used for comparability of neighborhood boundaries across time. Third, accounting for snapshots of neighborhood disadvantage only at the time of the two survey waves may not accurately represent the spatial exposure to disadvantage by youth given that families move on average three times during the study and the duration of residence in each neighborhood varies. This issue was addressed in two stages: First, the residential location of the youth and their families at multiple points during the study period was included in constructing the measures; second, neighborhood disadvantage and poverty were calculated to account for each and all known neighborhoods that youth lived in during this period, weighted by the duration of residence at each address.</p><p>Immediate neighborhoods are based on the census tract of residence. The extended neighborhoods are the immediate tract and the s number of closest tracts surrounding it. The main analyses are based on s = 4, but spatial scales between 2 and 8 also are explored. TIGER/Line shape data were used to map the neighborhoods and to calculate geographic distances between neighborhoods. Distances are calculated based on the geographic coordinates of the tract centroids. Moreover, for each census tract of residence during each year of the study, distance to the nearest disadvantaged neighborhood is calculated in miles at the same time point as the time of residence.</p><p>The extreme disadvantage threshold used to define the three extended neighborhood types described earlier (see <ref type="figure" coords="11,162.23,550.67,32.27,9.21" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>) is based on the 95th percentile of the disadvantage distribution across all U.S. census tracts. This cutoff was chosen to separate tracts with roughly 40 percent poverty and more from the rest, as done in previous research (e.g., Jargowsky, 1997) while using a more comprehensive measure of neighborhood disadvantage <ref type="bibr" coords="11,62.11,598.50,180.06,9.21" target="#b76">(Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEDIATORS</head><p>Multiple potential mediators of neighborhood effects on delinquency and risk taking are assessed. Several indicators are used to convey different dimensions of social disorganization, including ties to old neighborhood, prosocial friends (involved in school activities), or delinquent friends (who carry a weapon or use drugs or are associated with gangs). Moreover, key dimensions of collective efficacy are assessed from caregivers' reports that neighbors would intervene when kids skip school, hang out at the street corner, or spray graffiti on a local building <ref type="bibr" coords="12,195.60,150.16,108.84,9.21" target="#b45">(Ludwig and Kling, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,306.97,150.16,120.21,9.21;12,44.60,162.13,49.52,9.21" target="#b76">Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997)</ref>. Measures of police responsiveness and both social and physical disorder are included. Other mediators convey differential opportunities. Opportunities for illegitimate gains are measured through neighborhood concentration of medium-to-high-wage jobs derived from LEHD data. Job occupants may constitute the "desirable targets" of routine activities. Potential offenders also may be "motivated" by blocked legitimate opportunities, measured as the absence of low-to-medium-wage jobs in the neighborhood. Two scales are used to assess anomie and strain. Youth's reports of low chances to find a good job or attend college may indicate anomie, a disconnect between the means and conventional goals of success. The psychological distress index <ref type="bibr" coords="12,321.52,257.77,90.28,9.21" target="#b39">(Kessler et al., 2002)</ref> assesses how often youth felt depressed, nervous, restless or fidgety, hopeless, worthless, or everything as requiring effort.</p><p>Exposure to neighborhood crime is based on youth's reports of having witnessed shootings or stabbings, drugs, or gangs in the neighborhood. Such exposures may constitute a context of socialization, social disorder, and sources of strain. Victimization is based on youth reports of having been shot, cut, or stabbed in the past year. Neighborhood safety and crime is in part assessed from adults' reports. Rates of violent and property crime and distance to crime hotspots are based on police records from the NNCS <ref type="bibr" coords="12,352.57,353.40,74.60,9.21;12,44.60,365.37,62.51,9.21" target="#b42">(Krivo, Peterson, and Kuhl, 2009</ref>). The natural log of rates per tract population is used to reduce skewness. Exposures to crime may signal social disorder but also feed strain and motivate offending under routine activities. <ref type="table" coords="12,149.79,389.27,31.75,9.21">Table S</ref>.3 presents more details on these indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANALYTICAL APPROACH</head><p>The following analyses assess the predictive role of living in concentrated disadvantage on youth's risky and delinquent behavior primarily through a two-stage, least-squares (TSLS) approach. To improve the precision of the estimation and account for any chance differences between groups before the random assignment, the models include as controls a wide set of individual, household, and neighborhood covariates reported by adults and youth, as listed in table S.2 <ref type="bibr" coords="12,163.99,496.87,71.34,9.21" target="#b58">(Orr et al., 2003)</ref>. Rather than simply compare effects across the treatment and control groups, the TSLS approach follows the practice in the published MTO analyses to use 10 site-by-treatment instrumental variables to capitalize on variation in treatment intensity across voucher types and cities while controlling for site <ref type="bibr" coords="12,396.99,532.74,30.17,9.21;12,44.60,544.69,109.44,9.21" target="#b40">(Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,157.16,544.69,135.23,9.21" target="#b41">Kling, Ludwig, and Katz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,295.49,544.69,85.36,9.21" target="#b44">Ludwig et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,383.95,544.69,43.24,9.21;12,44.60,556.64,21.91,9.21" target="#b58">Orr et al., 2003)</ref>. The first-stage equation is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="12,178.86,576.97,248.31,10.60">NC = Z × Sπ 1 + Xβ 1 + ε 1<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where NC represents the index of neighborhood context of interest, such as poverty rate or extended types of concentrated disadvantage; Z represents the treatment group assignments; S represents the site indicators; and X represents the baseline controls. The resulting NC estimates are used in the second stage to estimate the effects of the specific neighborhood attributes on risk taking and delinquency, Y:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="13,184.39,105.21,238.55,10.60">Y = NCγ 2 + Xβ 2 + ε 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where γ 2 represents the association between the outcome and the neighborhood context (NC). In contrast to the regular regression approach, the TSLS method helps to adjust for neighborhood selection. 5 This approach assumes that the only source of variation across sites in treatment effects on youth behavior is the variation across sites in how treatment shapes postrandomization features of the neighborhoods. The standard errors are adjusted for household clustering. Causal interpretations of neighborhood effect estimates are a function of the validity of the instruments based on two main criteria: relevance (identifiability) and exogeneity <ref type="bibr" coords="13,40.37,222.83,116.89,9.21" target="#b2">(Angrist and Pischke, 2008)</ref>. Most valid instruments are derived from random assignment or natural, quasi-experiments. Identifiability depends on the strength of the correlations between the site-by-treatment group instruments and the endogeneous neighborhood attributes (after controlling for the exogenous covariates). Meeting this criterion requires, among other things, that the excluded instruments and endogenous regressors are correlated. If the surrounding neighborhood disadvantage is in part affected by families' choices rather than by the treatment assignment, then the strength of the instruments in predicting the extended disadvantage may weaken.</p><p>To gauge the validity of the instruments and the model specification, several first-stage estimates were assessed. In models using duration-weighted poverty, the first-stage equation yielded an F statistic for the instruments excluded in the second-stage equation of 18.49 when predicting risky behavior and 18.30 for delinquency. The partial R-squared was .112 for risky behavior and .111 for delinquency. In models using the extended indices of concentrated disadvantage, the first-stage equation yielded an F statistic for the excluded instruments in predicting risky behavior of 5.1 and 16.2, with partial R-squared values of .034 and .100. These numbers were similar to Ludwig and Kling's reports of F statistics between 6 and 29 and R-squared values between .028 and . <ref type="bibr" coords="13,355.22,414.11,63.46,9.21">118 (2007: 499)</ref>. Given the use of multiple endogenous regressors, the instruments indicate reasonable explanatory power on the neighborhood attributes. Still, to address possible remaining concerns, limited information maximum-likelihood information estimations <ref type="bibr" coords="13,367.98,449.98,54.94,9.21;13,40.37,461.94,50.73,9.21" target="#b45">(Ludwig and Kling, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,93.14,461.94,83.55,9.21" target="#b44">Ludwig et al., 2012)</ref> were conducted. The results were similar to TSLS, except girls' extended nonconcentration coefficient, which lost some precision at c = 95.</p><p>The test statistics for exclusion of over-identifying restrictions, when the firststage equation <ref type="formula" coords="13,109.37,497.80,12.73,9.21" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> is estimated using the extended indices of concentrated disadvantage, are as follows: Sargan' chi-squared = 4.736 (p = .785), Basman chi-squared = 4.561 (p = .803), and Woolridge's chi-squared (robust to heterosckedasticity) = 4.450 (p = .814). In the alternative limited information maximum-likelihood estimation, the Anderson-Rubin chi-squared = 4.747 (p = .784) and Basman F = .570 (p = .804). These 5. Selection bias occurs when unobserved factors that shape youth outcomes also influence the types of neighborhoods to which they move, confounding the estimates of the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and outcomes. Experimental studies like the MTO aim to eliminate selection by randomly assigning respondents to treatment or control conditions. tests are nonsignificant, indicating that one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid. The results increase the confidence in the validity of the instruments and in the correct specification of the model. These results are consistent with prior studies <ref type="bibr" coords="14,58.71,96.37,108.29,9.21" target="#b45">(Ludwig and Kling, 2007)</ref>. Exogeneity depends on satisfying the exclusion restriction that the site-by-treatment group instruments are uncorrelated with the error term, which means that random assignment does not affect youth risk taking directly (after controlling for the endogenous regressors) or through omitted variables. In other words, the offer of a voucher is assumed not to affect youth behavior if it does not change exposure to neighborhood poverty. The MTO's design was focused on decreasing neighborhood poverty in the immediate tracts of residence. Although the extended neighborhood disadvantage includes by definition information on immediate neighborhood poverty, new uncertainty may be introduced with respect to the exclusion restriction when the endogenous regressors rely also on variation in disadvantage in surrounding neighborhoods. <ref type="bibr" coords="14,249.79,214.36,3.49,6.44">6</ref> The current analyses are thus intended to be exploratory and associational rather than causal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Steps</head><p>In the following discussion, descriptive statistics are first used to compare different features of youth's immediate and surrounding neighborhood environments by gender and random assignment group and by extended categories of concentrated disadvantage (tables 1 and 2). Second, a series of TSLS analyses by gender are conducted to estimate risky behavior and delinquency while using the 10 site-by-treatment instruments and controlling for baseline covariates. <ref type="table" coords="14,205.68,330.63,34.81,9.21" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> models assess the role of neighborhood poverty and disadvantage on youth behavior. The spatial scale of the neighborhood starts with the immediate census tract of residence and is next extended to include four surrounding tracts. <ref type="table" coords="14,130.24,366.50,33.29,9.21" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> models estimate youth behavior by gender as a function of the three types of extended neighborhoods, as distinguished previously (figure 1), using extended concentration of disadvantage as reference. <ref type="table" coords="14,276.56,390.41,32.34,9.21" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> models investigate the role of the same neighborhood categories in predicting social disorganization and differential opportunity mediators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>As a result of the MTO intervention, male and female youth lost between 9 and 13 percentage points on average in immediate neighborhood poverty and about 6 percentage points in extended neighborhood poverty during the duration of the study. They shed on average between .61 and 1.01 standard deviations in immediate concentrated disadvantage and between .43 and .45 standard deviations in surrounding disadvantage. The differences between those in the intervention and the control groups also are 6. The exclusion restriction assumption, in general, relies on theoretical justification more than statistical tests. Theoretically, researchers have long recognized that together with poverty, other environmental features changed as a result of the MTO <ref type="bibr" coords="14,266.48,581.58,74.41,7.82" target="#b44">(Ludwig et al., 2012)</ref>. If the treatment influenced extended environmental exposures differently than immediate poverty and changed youth's behavior through them, as suggested in this study, then satisfying the exclusion restriction assumption may rely on including (rather than omitting) information on the extended environment.  statistically significant in the average distance to the nearest disadvantage hotspot and exposures to extended concentrated and nonconcentrated disadvantage <ref type="table" coords="17,351.79,495.11,35.50,9.21" target="#tab_1">(table 1)</ref>. On average, the MTO youth reside in extended neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage that exhibit poverty levels of 49 percent and 40 percent in the immediate and surrounding tracts, respectively. Their extended nonconcentrated environments and localized concentrated areas have about 22 and 40 percent poor residents in the immediate neighborhood, respectively, and 20 and 29 percent poor residents, respectively, in the surrounding neighborhood. This ordered pattern, where localized disadvantage ranks about midway between the other categories, is repeated with respect to other neighborhood features such as unemployment and concentrated disadvantage <ref type="table" coords="17,351.22,590.75,36.92,9.21" target="#tab_2">(table 2)</ref>. Moreover, on vacant housing, racial/ethnic diversity, local jobs, and violent crime rates, youth's localized concentration area scores look more like their extended nonconcentration scores.</p><p>The results from intent-to-treat analyses show that the program contributed to less risky behavior by girls than the control group but more risky behavior by boys. The gender differences in these effects are statistically significant (table S.4 and section IV in the online supporting information). The TSLS method is next applied to estimate the effects of neighborhood poverty on youth's risky and delinquent behavior by gender.</p><p>As summarized in table 3, the results show a significant positive effect of exposure to immediate neighborhood poverty or disadvantage during the duration of the study on girls' risky behavior. Interpreted in the context of the MTO moves, the coefficients indicate that female respondents in the treatment groups and sites that experience relatively larger reductions in exposure to neighborhood poverty between their origin and destination locations also experience a relatively lower prevalence of risky behavior. However, the results show a reverse effect of neighborhood poverty and disadvantage on boys' behavior. In the context of the MTO moves, the coefficients indicate that male respondents in the treatment groups and sites that experience relatively larger reductions in exposure to immediate neighborhood poverty between their origin and destination locations also experience a relatively higher prevalence of risky behavior. Neighborhood poverty seems to have little effect on delinquency. Previous studies reported similar findings in the effects of immediate neighborhood poverty <ref type="bibr" coords="18,225.90,601.60,142.31,9.21" target="#b40">(Kling, Liebman, and Katz, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXTENDED NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS</head><p>The delinquency noneffects and especially the unexpected increase in boys' risky behavior have puzzled and troubled scholars and policy makers alike. Have these studies perhaps missed something about the larger spatial context of the respondents that may explain the observed effects? The analyses presented in table 3 begin to address this question by increasing the neighborhood scale to account for the four neighboring tracts. When averaging immediate tract poverty with the poverty level of the four nearest neighbors in the extended neighborhood models, the coefficient increases in absolute magnitude by approximately 36 percent (from 1.18 to 1.61) for girls and by approximately 22 percent (from -1.29 to -1.57) in predicting boys' risky behavior. Interestingly, when including only the surrounding neighborhood scores at different scales, 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively, without immediate scores, the analyses yield coefficients of even larger magnitude than the immediate neighborhood (table S.5 and section VII in the online supporting information).</p><p>The next sets of analyses begin to dig deeper and explore the relevance of interactions between the immediate and surrounding neighborhoods of the MTO youth. Spatial Durbin models that include the immediate poverty or disadvantage levels together with the surrounding levels and the interaction between the two suffer from multicollinearity because of strong associations between immediate and surrounding neighborhood disadvantage (r between .72 and .79 for poverty and disadvantage, scales s = 2 through 8). For this reason, instead of three highly correlated continuous exposure variables, three mutually exclusive categories of neighborhood exposures were distinguished as a function of the immediate disadvantage, surrounding disadvantage, and their interaction, as described previously. <ref type="table" coords="19,50.34,353.40,34.93,9.21" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> presents the results from TSLS models estimating the predictive role of extended neighborhood categories on female and male youth's risky behavior and delinquency, respectively. Across all models, the reference category is extended concentrated disadvantage. Model 1 results show that among girls, extended nonconcentrated disadvantage predicts decreased risky behavior relative to extended concentration. This finding is robust to controlling for the number of moves since random assignment (model 2) and for the duration spent in urban or suburban neighborhoods (model 3), and it is consistent with the spatial concentration hypothesis (hypothesis 1). The coefficients are not significant in estimating girls' delinquency.</p><p>Columns 3 and 4 of table 4 present results for male youth from estimations otherwise equivalent to those for girls. Model 1 findings show that, compared with living in neighborhoods of extended concentrated disadvantage, living under localized concentration is related to significant increases in boy's risky behavior by 1.44 of a standard deviation (p = .040, two-tailed test) and to significant increases in their delinquency by approximately .78 of a standard deviation (p = .048). These patterns are consistent with the spatial interaction hypothesis (hypothesis 3). In contrast, living in extended nonconcentrated disadvantage (model 1) makes no significant difference on boys' risky behavior or delinquency, which is contrary to the differential opportunity hypothesis (hypothesis 2). Similar extended nonconcentration coefficients emerge when predicting opportunityrelated delinquency items like selling drugs and stealing. The findings are similar when also controlling for the number of moves since random assignment (model 2) and for duration spent in urban or suburban neighborhoods (model 3). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPATIAL PATTERNING OF MEDIATORS</head><p>What is it about the extended neighborhood that encourages risky and delinquent behavior differently among boys and girls? The analyses presented in table 5 address this question by estimating the extended neighborhoods' relationships with possible mediators. The models are equivalent in structure to table 4's model 1, except the dependent variables, which are now the mediators. As used previously, the extended concentrated disadvantage is the reference category. Girls' localized concentrated environments are not significantly different than extended concentration of disadvantage in predicting most mediators. However, girls' extended nonconcentrated areas are associated with significantly lower ties to old neighborhoods, marginally significantly more friends engaged in school activities, significantly lower levels of reported social disorder like public drinking and people hanging out on the streets, and lower levels of physical disorder. Additionally, girls' extended nonconcentrated neighborhoods are associated with more responsiveness by the police, more collective efficacy, stronger beliefs in their chances to get a job or attend college in the future, lower levels of psychological distress, higher perceptions of neighborhood safety, lower violent crime rates, marginally lower property crime, and larger distances to nearby crime hotspots.</p><p>These results are consistent with the links between girls' extended nonconcentrated areas and decreased risky behavior highlighted in table 4. Girls' extended nonconcentrated  neighborhoods are not significantly associated with fewer delinquent networks; witnessing less drug activity, shootings, or other crime in the neighborhood; or with recent victimization experience. This result may be because of girls' low levels on these indices to begin with and is consistent with the nonsignificant effect of extended neighborhood on girls' delinquency. Overall, girls' results suggest support for the spatial concentration hypothesis (hypothesis 1), operating through decreased social disorganization and strain and increased prosocial associations. It is important to note that only improving the immediate or the surrounding area seems insufficient. Improvements in behavior and mediators necessitate that both the immediate and surrounding areas are without concentrated disadvantage.</p><p>Boys' exposure to localized concentrated disadvantage compared with extended concentration is associated with nonsignificant differences in ties to old neighborhoods, prosocial friends, peers and kin in gangs, neighborhood physical disorder, police responsiveness, immediate and extended density of middle-to-high-wage jobs, recent victimization experience, neighborhood crime rate, or distance to crime hotspots. At the same time, localized concentrated areas are significantly associated with the following:</p><p>r More delinquent peers, friends who use drugs, and social disorder such as public drinking and people hanging out on the street r Weaker collective efficacy and beliefs in chances for a good job r Higher psychological distress and odds of having witnessed shootings or stabbings, drugs, or gangs in the neighborhood r Marginally lower density of middle-to-low-wage jobs It is instructive that under localized concentration of disadvantage, boys' perceptions and experiences of crime are higher despite indications from police records of similar crime rates and parents' reports of marginally more safety than extended concentrated areas. If parents perceive higher neighborhood safety, then they may lower their guards and insist less on keeping their children out of the streets.</p><p>Boys' exposure to extended nonconcentrated disadvantage is associated with fewer ties to old neighborhoods, fewer peers and kin in gangs, lower physical disorder and neighborhood problems in general, more police responsiveness, lower chances of recent victimization, higher safety, lower violent and propriety crime rates, and larger distance to crime hotspots. Any expected benefits from these positive mediating patterns may be offset by extended nonconcentration's association-relative to extended concentration-with more friends who use drugs and nonsignificant decreases in perceived social disorder, collective efficacy, anomie and strain, and crime witnessing. Overall, the findings for boys support the spatial interaction perspective (hypothesis 3) through social disorganization and differential opportunity mediators.</p><p>Exploratory investigations were next conducted using each of the aforementioned possible mediators together with the extended neighborhood indices among the endogenous regressors in models otherwise similar to those in table 4. The positive estimate of localized concentrated disadvantage in predicting boys' risky behavior and delinquency dropped in magnitude and became nonsignificant when including delinquent peers, psychological distress, or belief in the future among the endogenous regressors, which suggests possible mediation. Indications of mediation are weaker for the other indices. Among girls, the negative coefficient of extended nonconcentrated disadvantage weakens in magnitude and loses its statistical significance when controlling for psychological distress and belief in the future. Because the mediators and the outcomes are measured at the same time, these mediation analyses are exploratory. Future tests using later outcome data will be valuable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="23,155.53,371.34,88.06,9.21" target="#b77">Sciandra et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity Analyses</head><p>Several types of sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, other concentrated disadvantage thresholds were applied. The results show that the 95th percentile threshold captured best the differences among the three categories of neighborhood interactions in their association with behavior best among males (figure S.1) and similar to other cutoffs among females (sections V and VI in the online supporting information). Second, comparisons between typical definitions of neighborhoods at the census tract level and less typical definitions based on gradually larger numbers of nearby tracts (s = 2 through 8) suggested that extended measures based on the four nearest neighbors yielded more consistent results among boys and girls (section VII in the online supporting information). Third, different variants of the extended neighborhood indices were calculated based on disadvantage exposure before the end of the fourth and fifth years after random assignment. The results show largely similar patterns as with the full duration indices (section VII in the online supporting information). Fourth, estimations were reiterated with alternative versions of the risky behavior and delinquency scales, excluding items one by one. The results show slight variations in precision but stable magnitude among the core estimates of interest, which suggests that no item predominantly shapes the main results (table S.7 and section IX in the online supporting information). These analyses are described in more detail in the in the online supporting information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study made the case that our collective understanding of neighborhood effects on crime will benefit from integrating the growing evidence on spatial spillovers of criminogenic risk and from taking into account the role of extended neighborhood environments in shaping individual behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXTENDING THE PICTURE OF NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS</head><p>The results suggest that extended neighborhoods contribute to understanding gender differences in risk taking. The extended environment mattered for both boys and girls but in different ways. Specifically, extended concentrated disadvantage predicted the highest prevalence of girls' risk taking.

They also may facilitate opportunities for risk taking and offending in the new neighborhoods and their surroundings.</p><p>Even in the absence of frustration and strain, the combination of local delinquent networks and increased access to desirable targets (because more nearby residents have incomes above the poverty threshold) may be sufficient to lead to an increased prevalence of deviance among boys. Moreover, that the localized concentrated disadvantage areas had significantly lower levels of collective efficacy and more social disorder than the extended concentrated areas meets the condition of low-guardianship of the routine activity perspective. Higher social disorder, such as people hanging out and drinking alcohol on the street, may result in cultural normalization of alcohol and substance use, which may increase the odds of risk taking and escalation of simple incivilities to serious offending.</p><p>The finding that boys in localized concentrated areas report weaker collective efficacy, increased disorder, and more crime than those in the extended areas of concentrated disadvantage seems to be inconsistent with previous findings of positive associations among poverty, disorganization, and crime <ref type="bibr" coords="25,200.02,311.56,180.76,9.21" target="#b76">(Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997)</ref>. This inconsistency may be because low-income adolescent boys' experiences do not represent all residents' experience. Indications of their divergence from the average experience emerge when comparing boys' reports of seeing shootings, drugs, and gangs in the neighborhood with their caregivers' reports of higher neighborhoods safety. 7 Further research on the gap in neighborhood perceptions between adolescents and adults will be invaluable.</p></div>

Indeed, deeper investigations into the MTO youth's time-use patterns in the current study showed that that girls in the control group were significantly more likely than boys in the control groups to 1) work soon after school, 2) participate in evening activities where their mother or an adult is present, 3) be at home in the evening, 4) spend more time reading, and 5) prefer to be alone. They were less likely to hang out with friends, generally, and had fewer friends they hang out with. In contrast, parents reported that they knew who male youth were with outside the home significantly less frequently than they reported about female youth (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="25,250.66,544.66,132.60,9.21" target="#b41">Kling, Ludwig, and Katz, 2005)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE</head><p>This study makes several contributions related to motivating, conceptualizing, and measuring the extended neighborhood context of risk-taking behavior. It also has limitations. The initial focus in the MTO design was on improving the immediate neighborhood exposures without explicit consideration to the extended neighborhood environments. For this reason, the coefficient estimates for the extended neighborhood attributes should be interpreted as associations. Although preliminary, the findings in this study are an important first step in highlighting how the extended neighborhood context may matter for gender differences in behavior. It would be of great value for future research and policy to take into account the wider spatial contexts of neighborhoods as part of the initial design, which would permit testing the causal links directly.</p><p>Although sensitivity analyses were conducted using thresholds other than the 95th percentile presented in this study, it would be valuable for future research to continue to explore the relevant cutoffs in national samples of youth. To protect respondents' confidentiality, youth's location could not be revealed at geographic levels smaller than the tract. Comparisons with gradually larger geographic scales indicated that extended measures based on four nearest neighbors performed better than two nearest neighbors or the immediate tract only. Still, access to youth's residential location more detailed than the tract will be invaluable to gain a deeper understanding of the microlocal processes at the street level <ref type="bibr" coords="26,170.77,466.99,99.81,9.21" target="#b84">(Weisburd et al., 2004)</ref>. Additionally, future research that assesses youth's nonresidential locations of routine activities (work, school, or friends' homes) will be important <ref type="bibr" coords="26,160.42,490.89,166.78,9.21" target="#b15">(Browning, Soller, and Jackson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="26,330.84,490.89,96.35,9.21;26,44.60,502.85,69.49,9.21" target="#b28">Graif, Gladfelter, and Matthews, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the research design does not permit a definitive assessment of the mediating processes or generalizations to other populations. Qualitative and mixed-method approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="26,97.91,538.72,160.55,9.21" target="#b9">(Briggs, Popkin, and Goering, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="26,262.49,538.72,140.17,9.21" target="#b19">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="26,406.70,538.72,15.36,9.21;26,44.60,550.67,158.21,9.21" target="#b63">Popkin, Leventhal, and Weisman, 2010)</ref> are better suited for studying processes. Exploring mechanisms based on MTO data and independent data sets however, even if noncausally, is valuable for gaining theoretical traction in understanding observed behavioral differences. Still, these data sets have their own limitations and only partially match the MTO sites when combined. It would be greatly valuable for future research to investigate the extended neighborhoods and mechanisms affecting delinquency and risky behavior in different cities and based on different samples. Moreover, to undo the effects of previous years of poverty exposure, interventions might be needed even earlier in childhood. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONTRIBUTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND POLICY</head><p>The findings advance criminology and the scholarship of neighborhood effects and gender in three main ways. Broadly, they demonstrate the value of a conceptual reframing of neighborhood effects to include the extended spatial context within which neighborhoods are embedded and to account for differential spatial distributions of concentrated disadvantage within extended environments. Specifically, the study contributes empirically through first-time evidence that interactions between surrounding and immediate neighborhoods are associated with differences in youth behavior and social contexts. Moreover, the results push the field forward by indicating that gender differences in offending are related to variation in spatially organized experiences of criminogenic risk and opportunity, especially delinquent peers, strain, and perceived absence of legitimate opportunities for success.</p><p>The extended spatial perspective to understanding neighborhood dynamics proposed in this study contributes to recent debates on the MTO (Clampet-Lundquist and <ref type="bibr" coords="27,388.38,257.66,34.58,9.21;27,40.37,269.62,22.41,9.21" target="#b20">Massey, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="27,65.59,269.62,62.54,9.21" target="#b68">Sampson, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="27,135.42,269.62,19.03,9.21" target="#b69">Sampson, , 2012</ref> and, more broadly, advance the neighborhood effects literature by incorporating insights on spatial interdependencies from recent advances in urban ecological research <ref type="bibr" coords="27,124.57,293.53,114.11,9.21" target="#b29">(Graif and Sampson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="27,240.94,293.53,105.82,9.21" target="#b35">Hipp and Boessen, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="27,349.02,293.53,68.38,9.21;27,40.37,305.49,120.03,9.21" target="#b54">Morenoff, Sampson, and Raudenbush, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="27,162.69,305.49,159.89,9.21" target="#b73">Sampson, Morenoff, and Earls, 1999)</ref> and on cross-boundary interactions from ethnographic research <ref type="bibr" coords="27,214.76,317.44,66.97,9.21" target="#b32">(Harding, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="27,283.97,317.44,93.00,9.21" target="#b61">Pattillo-McCoy, 1999)</ref>. The findings are in line with growing research demonstrating the interplay between neighborhoods and surroundings in shaping other types of outcomes like birth weight <ref type="bibr" coords="27,375.05,341.35,47.86,9.21;27,40.37,353.31,23.79,9.21" target="#b52">(Morenoff, 2003)</ref> and residential mobility <ref type="bibr" coords="27,174.89,353.31,117.98,9.21" target="#b23">(Crowder and South, 2008)</ref>. The results suggest that our understanding of delinquency and crime will greatly advance if the extended neighborhoods are evaluated more systematically in future studies.</p><p>The findings in this study also have important implications for refining research and thinking on urban housing and mobility policies. In response to discouraging past findings that improved neighborhoods seemed to put low-income boys at higher risk than no intervention, this study suggests that such harmful implications disappear when both the immediate and the surrounding neighborhoods are improved. Housing mobility policies may, thus, benefit from paying as close attention to the surrounding neighborhoods as to the immediate ones. 9 Moreover, supplementary results indicate that going beyond poverty to focus on disadvantage more broadly, especially unemployment and femaleheaded households, may bring additional leverage in understanding youth risk taking (see table S.6 and section VIII in the online supporting information).</p><p>Moreover, this study's findings contribute to research and policy by suggesting that social processes like associations with delinquent peers, extended exposure to criminogenic 8. The interpretability of the findings with respect to the effects of growing up in a poor neighborhood is limited if the most relevant neighborhoods are those in which children live before their school years. 9. Although localized concentrated disadvantage seems to carry the most negative implications for boys, it is important to emphasize that long-term benefits of transitioning out of extended concentrated disadvantage on youth outcomes more broadly may make it worth investing in mitigating initial risks. risk, or neighborhood social control may be more prevalent in certain spatial configurations than in others. Existing programs focused on social support networks, adult bonding, mentors, and prosocial peer associations, among others (see <ref type="bibr" coords="28,305.18,84.41,117.51,9.21" target="#b26">Farrington and Welsh, 2006</ref>, for a review) may need to be refined with a focus on offsetting the drawbacks of exposure to localized concentrated disadvantage. <ref type="bibr" coords="28,214.53,106.77,6.97,6.44" target="#b11">10</ref> Both genders will benefit from policies focused on the extended environments. However, the findings suggest that males may require more targeted attention and support programs to mitigate risk factors related to residential transitions. Improved knowledge of the spatial interactions that increase youth's exposure to criminogenic risk will be valuable not only in refining future programs like the MTO, which are focused on individuals on the move, but also in guiding place-based interventions, which are focused on improving whole neighborhoods. 11</p><p>Corina Graif is an assistant professor of sociology and criminology and a research associate at the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University.

NOTES: Extended concentrated disadvantage is the reference category in all models. All TSLS models include 
10 site-by-treatment interactions as excluded instruments and the baseline covariates for adults and youth listed 
in table S.2. Male (n = 723) and female (n = 800) youth are from all five cities. Standard errors adjusted for 
clustering are in parentheses. Units of the summary indices are standard deviations from the control group's 
outcome. 
ABBREVIATION: SE = standard error.

NOTES: Standard errors adjusted for clustering are in parentheses. Extended CD is the context of reference 
in all models. The TSLS models include 10 site-by-treatment interactions as excluded instruments and baseline 
covariates, as listed in table S.2. 
ABBREVIATIONS: CD = concentrated disadvantage; SE = standard error. 
a Measures are based on reports by MTO study youth in all five cities. 
b Measures are based on youth's adult caregivers' reports in the MTO study in all five cities. 
c Neighborhood measures are based on LEHD matched to the MTO youth in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles,
