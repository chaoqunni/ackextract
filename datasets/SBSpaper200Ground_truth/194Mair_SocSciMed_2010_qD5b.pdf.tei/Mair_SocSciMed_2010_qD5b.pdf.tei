Two-level multilevel models were used to estimate associations of neighborhood racial/ethnic composition with CES-D scores after controlling for age, income, marital status, education and nativity. We found that living in a neighborhood with a higher percentage of residents of the same race/ethnicity was associated with increased CES-D scores in African American men (p &lt; 0.05), and decreased CES-D scores in Hispanic men and women and Chinese women, although these differences were not statistically significant. Models were further adjusted for neighborhood-level covariates (social cohesion, safety, problems, aesthetic quality and socioeconomic factors) derived from survey responses and census data. Adjusting for other neighborhood characteristics strengthened protective associations amongst Hispanics, but did not change the significant associations in African American men. These results demonstrate heterogeneity in the associations of race/ethnic composition with mental health and the need for further exploration of which aspects of neighborhood environments may contribute to these associations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>It has long been argued that the racial/ethnic composition of a neighborhood may be related to the presence of depressive symptoms in residents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,140.47,594.01,59.72,7.54" target="#b20">(Halpern, 1993)</ref>. There are two main hypotheses regarding the relation between neighborhood racial/ ethnic composition and depressive symptoms. Each of these hypotheses postulates a different relation between race/ethnic composition and depression. The first hypothesis (referred to as the ethnic density hypothesis) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,143.78,646.35,96.46,7.54" target="#b21">(Halpern &amp; Nazroo, 2000)</ref> proposes that persons who live in neighborhoods with a greater proportion of residents of their own race or ethnicity have better mental health outcomes (and lower levels of depressive symptoms) than persons who live in neighborhoods with fewer people of their race/ ethnicity. The second hypothesis (which we will refer to as the residential segregation hypothesis) postulates that persons who live in neighborhoods with a greater proportion of residents of their own race or ethnicity have worse mental health outcomes (and higher levels of depressive symptoms) than persons who live in neighborhoods with fewer people of their race/ethnicity.</p><p>According to the ethnic density hypothesis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,501.68,635.87,60.91,7.54" target="#b20">(Halpern, 1993)</ref> greater ethnic density is beneficial to mental health because ethnic density is associated with social environments characterized by greater levels of social support and social cohesion and with better access to resources through social connections <ref type="bibr" coords="1,494.24,677.71,68.33,7.54;1,311.54,688.20,20.11,7.54" target="#b22">(Henderson et al., 2005)</ref>. For example, immigrants living in neighborhoods with large proportions of immigrants may have stronger social ties, more social support from kinship networks or community institutions, or better access to resources distributed through dense networks than immigrants living in neighborhoods where they are the minority <ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.83,87.69,207.40,7.54" target="#b13">(Eschbach, Ostir, Patel, Markides, &amp; Goodwin, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,244.60,87.69,39.34,7.54;2,32.83,98.12,95.53,7.54" target="#b14">Fernandez Kelly &amp; Schauffler, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,132.09,98.12,73.20,7.54" target="#b49">Velez-Ibanez, 1993)</ref>. In contrast, immigrants living away from immigrant-dense areas may experience isolation (Fernandez <ref type="bibr" coords="2,112.49,119.04,89.92,7.54" target="#b14">Kelly &amp; Schauffler, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, according to the residential segregation hypothesis, greater neighborhood concentrations of certain race/ ethnic groups are associated with adverse mental health outcomes because of the consequences of residential segregation. For example, factors such as institutional racism, forced segregation due to historical and contemporary discrimination in housing markets, and truncated economic opportunities among racial/ ethnic minority groups may result in concentrations of race/ethnic or immigrant groups in certain geographic areas. These areas are often disadvantaged in terms of physical and social characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,169.17,234.14,55.48,7.54" target="#b33">Massey, 2001)</ref> which in turn places residents in segregated neighborhoods at higher risk of depression <ref type="bibr" coords="2,75.99,255.06,99.17,7.54" target="#b24">(Iceland &amp; Scopilliti, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.28,255.06,93.01,7.54" target="#b52">Williams &amp; Collins, 2001)</ref>. In other words, higher concentration of certain race/ethnic groups is associated with worse mental health because, in the context of residential segregation, race/ethnic composition serves as a proxy for adverse social and physical contexts, including higher prevalence of stressors, fewer social assets to buffer stressors, and poorer access to resources. For example, in the US, predominantly African American neighborhoods are often (though not always) associated with greater poverty and higher crime rates <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.42,338.75,52.68,7.54" target="#b32">(Massey, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,80.75,349.24,60.80,7.54" target="#b34">Morenoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,143.51,349.24,94.57,7.54" target="#b52">Williams &amp; Collins, 2001)</ref> and regions with high racial residential segregation exhibit large differences in the neighborhood environments associated with racial/ethnic composition (Acevedo-Garcia, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,147.82,380.59,136.08,7.54" target="#b2">Osypuk, McArdle, &amp; Williams, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.85,391.08,201.68,7.54" target="#b37">Osypuk, Galea, McArdle, &amp; Acevedo-Garcia, 2009</ref>). Although countries differ in the degree of residential segregation by race/ ethnicity, these mechanisms have been hypothesized to operate in may industrialized countries receiving substantial numbers of immigrants <ref type="bibr" coords="2,79.11,432.93,132.06,7.54" target="#b6">(Becares, Nazroo, &amp; Stafford, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.81,432.93,70.05,7.54;2,32.85,443.36,22.32,7.54" target="#b21">Halpern &amp; Nazroo, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,59.49,443.36,107.17,7.54" target="#b39">Pickett &amp; Wilkinson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.01,443.36,76.84,7.54" target="#b50">Veling et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.19,443.36,31.71,7.54;2,32.85,453.85,130.76,7.54" target="#b51">Whitley, Prince, McKenzie, &amp; Stewart, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The relative importance of the processes outlined above may differ for different racial/ethnic groups. For example, among relatively recent immigrants (e.g. Hispanics in the US), the protective effects of higher percents of neighborhood immigrants may predominate (ethnic density hypothesis) whereas in other groups (e.g. African Americans in the US) the adverse effects of residential segregation resulting from a long history of structural racism (residential segregation hypothesis) may predominate. For these reasons, the direction of the association of race/ethnic composition with depressive symptoms may vary by ethnic group within a country.</p><p>Few studies have investigated the association between neighborhood racial/ethnic composition and depressive symptoms in multiple ethnic groups living in the same country. Individuals in the UK were found to have lower levels of neurotic mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep problems) in areas with higher own-group ethnic concentration, but the strength of the associations was stronger for minority groups than whites <ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.56,642.14,33.36,7.54;2,32.85,652.63,59.18,7.54" target="#b21">(Halpern &amp; Nazroo, 2000)</ref>. In the US, studies focusing on both African Americans and whites have generally found no evidence that neighborhood racial composition is associated with depressive symptoms after adjustment for confounders <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.88,683.99,105.03,7.54" target="#b22">(Henderson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.85,694.48,85.14,7.54" target="#b26">Kubzansky et al., 2005)</ref>. No US studies of which we are aware have comprehensively investigated associations of race/ethnic composition with depressive symptoms in multi-ethnic samples.</p><p>We used data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to investigate the ethnic density and residential segregation hypotheses through the examination of cross-sectional associations of neighborhood racial/ethnic composition with depressive symptoms amongst healthy adults aged 45e84 years from four different racial/ethnic groups. We also examined if any of the observed associations were explained by specific neighborhood attributes, including neighborhood poverty, levels of social cohesion, and stressors. Given the high magnitude and form of racial residential segregation in the US, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.52,139.96,56.81,7.62" target="#b33">(Massey, 2001)</ref> we hypothesized that high concentrations of African American residents would be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms among African Americans, while high concentrations of white residents would be associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms among white residents. The positive mental health association for whites may operate either via the residential segregation theory or the ethnic density theory, since both posit better neighborhood environments for whites living in neighborhoods with high concentrations of other whites. In contrast, we hypothesized that Hispanics and Asians would exhibit positive mental health associations of living in neighborhoods with high proportions of coethnics due to the ethnic density theory, which is more likely to operate among relatively recent immigrants. Although we examined these patterns in the US, where residential segregation is particularly stark, the investigation of associations in the US may yield insights into the mechanisms operating in many different contexts, and is likely to be relevant to other industrialized countries receiving large numbers of immigrants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study setting and population</head><p>The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a ten-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 45 to 84. Participants were enrolled at six study field centers (Baltimore MD, New York NY, Chicago IL, Los Angeles CA, Minneapolis MN, and Forsyth County NC) between August 1 2000 and July 30 2002. At each site, a probability sample of participants (range: 1066e1319) was selected through a variety of population-based approaches, including lists of area residents (all sites), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) lists of area residents (for participants !65 of age in all sites), area residents enrolled in a union health plan (in New York City), and random digit dialing (New York City and Los Angeles) . All sites aimed to enroll an equal number of men and women and at least two different racial/ethnic groups. Participants were free of clinically evident cardiovascular disease at the time of enrollment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,425.75,537.53,60.77,7.54" target="#b8">(Bild et al., 2002)</ref>. The data used in this study came from the baseline examination data collected during 2000e2002. Surveys were administered in English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. Institutional review boards at all participating study centers approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all study participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and variables</head><p>The primary outcome for this study was participants' depressive symptoms, measured in MESA participants using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale <ref type="bibr" coords="2,521.27,652.62,31.62,7.54;2,301.83,663.06,19.22,7.54" target="#b42">(Radloff, 1977)</ref>. Each scale item is scored from 0 to 3, with a higher score representing more depressive symptoms. The potential range of this scale is 0e60, with a score of 16 often used as the cutoff for clinical depression. The CES-D scale was used as a continuous variable, since it was not highly skewed.</p><p>The main exposure variable was a census-derived measure of the percentage of people of the same race/ethnicity in a study participant's census tract. We used data from the 2000 US census to derive the percentages of each of four race/ethnic groups in each census tract: percent non-Hispanic African American, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian. Each of these variables was transformed into units of 10% increase in order to ease interpretation of results, as a 1% change in racial/ethnic composition is not large enough to be relevant and a change of 100% is beyond the range of variation observed in the data.</p><p>Additional neighborhood characteristics were assessed through a questionnaire administered to MESA participants. Four neighborhood dimensions linked to depressive symptoms in other study populations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.06,171.38,102.85,7.54" target="#b3">(Aneshensel &amp; Sucoff, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,193.72,171.38,99.85,7.54;3,42.52,181.81,51.85,7.54" target="#b15">Fitzpatrick, Piko, Wright, &amp; LaGory, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,96.10,181.81,187.95,7.54" target="#b19">Hadley-Ives, Stiffman, Elze, Johnson, &amp; Dore, 2000)</ref> as well as in the MESA population <ref type="bibr" coords="3,164.41,192.30,68.10,7.54" target="#b29">(Mair et al., 2009)</ref> were examined as possible confounders or mediators of the race/ethnic composition effect. These dimensions were as follows: one domain related to assets in the social environment, e.g. social cohesion (constructed from five items) and three domains related to the construct of neighborhood stressors (neighborhood safety (three items), neighborhood problems (seven items), and aesthetic quality (two items)) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,93.78,265.50,142.90,7.54" target="#b5">(Ball, Bauman, Leslie, &amp; Owen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,240.03,265.50,53.54,7.54;3,42.53,275.98,150.63,7.54" target="#b35">Mujahid, Diez Roux, Morenoff, &amp; Raghunathan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,196.44,275.98,97.14,7.54;3,42.53,286.47,41.48,7.54" target="#b44">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997)</ref>. All four scales had acceptable ecometric properties, i. e. they were reliable measures of area-level constructs and were related to other neighborhood-level properties in the expected direction <ref type="bibr" coords="3,79.15,317.83,82.79,7.54" target="#b35">(Mujahid et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,164.63,317.83,128.92,7.54;3,42.53,328.32,20.11,7.54" target="#b38">Osypuk, Roux, Hadley, &amp; Kandula, 2009)</ref>, and were similar to scales used in prior work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,248.71,328.32,44.88,7.54;3,42.54,338.75,157.42,7.54" target="#b13">(Echeverria, Diez-Roux, Shea, Borrell, &amp; Jackson, 2008)</ref>. For each MESA participant we created a measure for his or her neighborhood based on the mean responses of all other MESA participants residing within one mile of the participant. One-mile buffers were used instead of census tracts in order to better capture variation in these dimensions over space and in the individual-level exposure to these conditions in the sample. Each neighborhood measure was transformed into units of standard deviations (for the full sample), in order to allow comparisons across scales and measurements. Higher values of the scales indicate higher social cohesion, safety, more problems, and a better aesthetic quality.</p><p>We also investigated two neighborhood socioeconomic status variables that were created using factor analysis of nineteen variables from the 2000 US census <ref type="bibr" coords="3,170.87,474.77,122.71,7.54;3,42.54,485.20,128.45,7.54" target="#b36">(Mujahid, Diez Roux, Morenoff, Raghunathan, Cooper, et al., 2008)</ref>. The first factor score consisted of six items representing housing and income/wealth (% vacant housing, % of homes with no telephone, % of homes with no vehicle, % unemployed, median household income, and % poverty) (SES Factor 1). This factor explained 61% of variance. The second factor score used three measures to represent education, occupation, and income/wealth (% of persons 25 or older with bachelors degree or higher, % with non-managerial occupation, % households with interest, dividends, or net rental income) (SES Factor 2), and explained 22% of variance. Despite their conceptual overlap, both factors were included in this analysis as each one explained a substantial proportion of the variance across the nineteen items. For both SES Factors, higher scores indicate lower socioeconomic position.</p><p>Individual-level covariates associated with both depressive symptoms and neighborhood conditions were also used in the analysis. These variables included gender, age, race/ethnicity, annual income, highest level of education achieved, marital status, and nativity, all assessed at the MESA baseline exam. Age was categorized into four groups (45e54, 55e64, 65e74, 75e84). Race and ethnicity were classified as Caucasian, African American, Chinese, and Hispanic, based on self-report using questions from the Year 2000 US census. Total gross family income was categorized into five levels: &lt;$20,000, $20,000e34,999, $35,000e49,999, $50,000e74,999, and $75,000þ. Education was categorized as: less than high school, completed high school, some college or a trade or Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, and graduate/professional degree. Marital status was categorized as: married/living as married, widowed, divorced/separated, single, and prefer not to say. Four categories of nativity were used: foreign-born and in the US less than 10 years, foreign-born and in the US 10e19 years, foreign-born and in the US 20þ years, and US-born. Additional adjustment for self-reported health did not substantially change results and was not included in final analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Analyses were stratified by gender, in order to allow for potential gender differences in the association between depressive symptoms and neighborhood characteristics which have been found in several studies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,403.98,223.65,158.66,7.54" target="#b7">(Berke, Gottlieb, Moudon, &amp; Larson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,311.54,234.14,87.55,7.54" target="#b15">Fitzpatrick et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,401.68,234.14,99.81,7.54" target="#b18">Gutman &amp; Sameroff, 2004)</ref>. Analyses were also stratified by race/ethnicity, because the main exposure of interest (% people of the same racial/ethnic background in participants' census tracts) differed for each racial/ethnic group and because our hypotheses involved effect modification by race/ ethnicity. We examined the distribution of all individual-level and neighborhood-level covariates, by gender and racial/ethnic group.</p><p>Associations between neighborhood context and mental health may be non-linear; for example it may be that the protective social factors only become apparent above a certain concentration. In order to determine whether the associations between CES-D score and % racial/ethnic composition were linear, we used scatter plots and generalized additive models (GAMs) to look at the shape of the associations and test for non-linearity. We also examined associations between our primary neighborhood-level variables, % residents of each racial/ethnic group, and the six other neighborhood-level covariates by modeling the neighborhood characteristics as a function of neighborhood race/ethnic composition. The correlations between the neighborhood variables were low to moderate (Pearson Correlation Coefficients were mostly in the 0.2e0.5 range).</p><p>Two-level multilevel models with a random intercept for each census tract were used to estimate associations of ethnic composition (percent of people of the same racial/ethnic background) with depressive symptoms. The random intercept was used to account for any residual withinetract correlation in outcomes. All models were adjusted for age, income, and education, as these are potentially key confounders of the relationship between depressive symptoms and neighborhood racial/ethnic composition. Models for Hispanic and Chinese participants additionally adjusted for nativity; over 90% of white and black participants were native-born, so nativity was not adjusted for in these groups. We then examined whether any observed associations of ethnic composition with depressive symptoms were explained by other neighborhood factors (social cohesion, neighborhood problems, neighborhood safety, aesthetic quality, neighborhood socioeconomic status). We added these variables to our models, first one at a time, and then in combination. None of the individual-or neighborhood-level covariates simultaneously included in any models were highly correlated. We did not adjust for antidepressant use because it was not associated with neighborhood race/ethnic composition and because of the known methodological limitations of adjusting for a variable that is a consequence of the outcome <ref type="bibr" coords="3,529.64,663.06,32.96,7.54;3,311.55,673.55,125.66,7.54" target="#b23">(Hernan, Hernandez-Diaz, &amp; Robins, 2004)</ref>.

Across all models, we found significantly detrimental associations of higher % black neighborhoods with CES-D scores. This association was little affected by addition of other neighborhood covariates, and was strengthened considerably when all neighborhood and individual covariates were considered simultaneously. This is the only group for which we found that greater ethnic density was associated with greater depressive symptoms; these results are consistent with the residential segregation hypothesis. Almost half of our African American population lived in neighborhoods that were at least 75% African American, illustrating the importance of untangling what it is about highly segregated African American neighborhoods that are detrimental to African American men's mental health. The persistent association of neighborhood percent black with depressive symptoms may be due to other unmeasured stressors in black neighborhood environments, since neighborhood percent African American is likely to be proxying a variety of social characteristics, including high neighborhood crime, fear for the safety of one's family, discrimination, <ref type="bibr" coords="8,389.19,370.18,144.03,7.54" target="#b47">(Turner, Ross, Galster, &amp; Yinger, 2002)</ref> residential stability, or connection to job opportunities within the larger regional job market <ref type="bibr" coords="8,405.82,391.10,50.83,7.54">(Pastor, 2001)</ref>. Moreover, although we controlled for several aspects of individual/household SES, there are several unmeasured aspects of SES that could account for our neighborhood effects, including wealth, unemployment, underemployment, or occupation/type of work. Lastly, measurement error in the neighborhood-level measures that we examined as possible explanatory factors is highly likely and could explain why we did not identify much of a change in estimates of the race/ethnic composition association after adjustment. We used one-mile buffers (rather than census tract based measures) to capture neighborhood characteristics around people's residences. Unfortunately race/ethnic composition data for these buffers was unavailable. It is possible that the spatial mismatch between the race/ethnic composition measures and the neighborhood measures could have contributed to the failure of the latter to fully account for associations of race/ethnic composition with depressive symptoms in some analyses.</p><p>The fact that we observed robust adverse mental health associations for neighborhood percent black among black men but not among black women suggests that there may be gendered aspects of the neighborhood environment at play that are particularly relevant for black men's mental health.

For example, associations in Chinese women were quite strong although they never reached statistical significance. The distribution of race/ethnic composition differed substantially across race/ethnic groups, making comparisons of associations difficult. There was an indication that the associations may be non-linear in some groups, but the small sample size made it difficult for us to fully explore the shape of the associations. Possible non-linearity across the range of race/ethnic composition levels observed needs further exploration in datasets with larger sample sizes. MESA included participants in six different study sites. It is plausible that the meaning and implications for health of neighborhood race/ethnic composition varies across sites. For example, a neighborhood with a majority of Hispanic residents in New York City may have very different social interactions than one in Minneapolis. The white residents were sampled from six unique geographic locations, while the Chinese came from only two. Unfortunately limited sample size made it difficult to examine heterogeneity by site, although no interaction terms were statistically significant. Finally, for practical reasons related to data availability we used census tracts as crude proxies for the relevant race/ ethnic composition context, which undoubtedly introduced important measurement error.</p><p>A major challenge in estimating effects of neighborhood context on health is accounting for the selection of persons into neighborhoods based on other characteristics related to the outcome.

In contrast, the degree of residential choice may be more limited for native-born blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups as compared with whites or immigrants due to a variety of factors, including discrimination and racism in housing markets <ref type="bibr" coords="9,524.40,129.53,38.19,7.54;9,311.52,139.96,57.35,7.54" target="#b24">(Iceland &amp; Scopilliti, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The experience of living in a highly segregated neighborhood in the United States may be different than in other countries. In Canada, for example, highly segregated areas are not necessarily low-income ones <ref type="bibr" coords="9,385.56,181.81,81.24,7.54">(Abada et al., 2007)</ref>. In the United States, however, racially segregated areas (especially predominantly African American areas) tend to be associated with higher crime and poverty <ref type="bibr" coords="9,365.77,213.22,54.38,7.54" target="#b32">(Massey, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,498.15,213.22,64.42,7.54" target="#b34">Morenoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,311.52,223.65,94.64,7.54" target="#b52">Williams &amp; Collins, 2001)</ref>. Our finding that African American men have higher levels of depressive symptoms in neighborhoods with greater concentrations of African Americans may be specific to the United States. We have identified no studies outside the US that found higher minority racial/ethnic concentration to be associated with higher levels of depression/depressive symptoms. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the social support effect posited by the ethnic density hypothesis is operating in countries outside the US <ref type="bibr" coords="9,368.15,307.39,71.77,7.54" target="#b6">(Becares et al., 2009</ref>). An added complication is that both the ethnic density and residential segregation effects could operate simultaneously in some groups. Because their effects are opposite, they could conceivably cancel each other out. This is impossible to determine from the observational data we have.</p><p>In summary, we documented associations of neighborhood race/ethnic composition with depressive symptoms in African American men and to some extent in Hispanics and in Chinese women in a large US sample. The neighborhood variables we measured did not appear to explain observed patterns. Future work needs to replicate these kinds of analyses in other large multiethnic samples as well as to more fully examine the processes generating these associations. Additional cross-country comparisons of the associations of residential segregation with mental health may also shed light on the processes involved. Identifying whether and why neighborhood composition is associated with mental health may provide important clues regarding the social and psychological processes that cause or facilitate the development of depression and may suggest new avenues for prevention, especially in minority groups.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="5,51.53,42.48,666.57,323.56"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Selected individual-and neighborhood-level characteristics of study participants, by gender and race/ethnicity.</figDesc><table coords="5,276.95,65.22,441.15,32.53">All Participants
