Manuel Bohn was supported by a scholarship of the German National Academic Foundation. We would like to thank Elena Rossi and Sebastian Sch√ºtte for their support during data collection, Marike Schreiber for preparing Figs. 1 and 2, Lou Haux and Luise Hornoff for reliability coding and Roger Mundry for statistical advice. We also thank the animal keepers of the Zoo Leipzig for their help with the apes and the children and their parents for participating in the study. The idea for this study was conceived after a meeting of the Animal Cognition Reading Group at the MPI-EVA and we would like to thank all participants of that session for the inspiring discussion.
