<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>many studies of social capital assume that social networks and associational life can be beneficial to the collectivity ðColeman 1990; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,291.29,84.46,50.47,8.58" target="#b97">Portes 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,343.73,84.46,33.40,8.58;2,65.25,96.48,22.34,8.58" target="#b99">Putnam 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,90.71,96.48,112.09,8.58">Lin, Cook, and Burt 2001Þ</ref>. However, assessing the relationship between social networks and prosocial behavior is not sufficient in order to determine the building blocks of cooperation. If one wants to understand how cooperation emerges in a specific social setting, it is important to focus on how patterns of social relations affect actors' motives and their expectations about others' behavior. In other words, we need to go beyond the observation that patterns of social relations matter for cooperation, to study the mechanisms through which social relations may enhance collective outcomes.</p><p>Scholars have advanced different theories. On the one hand, there are interest-based explanations according to which repeated interactions set the basis for reciprocity and mutual sanctioning; repeated interaction makes it convenient for individuals to cooperate because long-term gains will offset the benefit of one-shot free riding. On the other hand, there are other-regarding explanations based on altruism, group solidarity, and norms of fairness ðAxelrod 1984; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,174.76,276.48,66.05,8.58" target="#b45">Gambetta 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.70,276.48,55.94,8.58" target="#b93">Ostrom 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,302.47,276.48,74.66,8.58;2,65.25,288.50,21.92,8.58" target="#b36">Fehr and Gächter 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,90.56,288.50,115.43,8.58">Nowak and Sigmund 2005Þ</ref>. However, in both the literature on collective action and that on social capital, these mechanisms are rarely compared with each other or tested across diverse settings ðCook, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,335.79,312.48,41.38,8.58;2,65.25,324.50,56.37,8.58">Levi, and Hardin 2009Þ</ref>. In this article, I identify and systematically measure four general mechanisms, that is, generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity, and the threat of sanctioning.</p><p>This article makes three theoretical contributions. First, it organizes the vast, multidisciplinary literature on decentralized solutions to collective action problems into four distinctive mechanisms and discusses their scope conditions. Second, it articulates the different ways in which social networks are implicated in each of the four mechanisms, thus contributing to our general understanding of the role of social networks in bringing about cooperation in small groups. Third, it connects the literature on collective action and social capital to some recent developments in behavioral economics, providing a blueprint for research design in this area.</p><p>I test the four alternative mechanisms in a context uniquely suited to this goal: Ugandan farmer cooperatives that face collective action problems on a regular basis. These producer organizations were created as part of Uganda's largest recent rural development intervention, whose goal was to support small farmers' integration into commercial farming by exploiting ðgrant SES½IOS-0924778Þ, the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies, and the Dondena Center at Bocconi University.

By adopting an innovative methodological framework that combines "lab-in-the-field" experiments with survey interviews and complete social networks data, this article goes beyond the assessment of a relationship between social networks and collective outcomes to study the mechanisms that undergird cooperative behavior. To achieve this goal, I took behavioral games, typically conducted in a laboratory environment, to the field. Members of farmer cooperatives participated in different variants of the dictator game and public goods game, providing reliable behavioral measures of their other-regarding preferences and cooperative capacity.</p><p>The empirical analysis unfolds as follows. First, relying on detailed social network information, I assess the relationship between social network position and collective outcomes, showing that farmers with greater network centrality and nonredundant social ties are more cooperative and participate more in the life of their producer organization. Second, I use lab-in-the-field experiments to distinguish between different mechanisms, such as generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity, and threat of sanctioning. This experimental component of the research makes it possible to establish the causal effect of group attachment on prosocial behavior and the causal effects that repeated interaction and the threat of sanctioning both have on cooperation.</p><p>Not only does performing laboratory experiments in a field setting with members of preexisting groups increase the external and ecological validity of the findings; more importantly, it makes it possible to relate experimental behavior to "real-life," observational behavior. That is, in the third part of the analysis I relate farmers' behavior in behavioral games to their level of cooperation in the producer organization in order to identify which mechanisms are more likely to account for levels of cooperation in the farmer groups. In this framework, the experimental intervention is therefore used as a "petri dish" to isolate the mechanisms that are likely to be at work in "real life." Results show that, in the context of the farmer organizations object of this study, cooperation is not induced by other-regarding mechanisms such as generalized altruism or group solidarity. Rather, it is the mechanism of reciprocity that emerges through sustained interaction that facilitates cooperation among local producers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COOPERATION FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES</head><p>Public goods provision is usually framed as a problem of cooperation between self-interested actors: in a context in which public goods are nonexcludable, rational, self-interested actors would rather free ride on others' contribution than cooperate ðOlson 1965Þ. The success of this analytical framework is due to its capacity to capture the tension between individual Cooperative Networks and collective interest-"the disparity between individual optimization and collective optimality" ðColeman 1989, p. 5Þ-and therefore reveal the social dilemma that limits the occurrence of many instances of collective action. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,374.11,95.29,3.00,4.58">2</ref> However, even supporters of rational choice approachðesÞ have conceded that we see more cooperation than expected under the assumption of selfish actors ðOpp 1999 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,151.56,132.48,4.47,8.58">;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,158.91,132.48,50.24,8.58" target="#b31">Elster 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,212.09,132.48,92.88,8.58" target="#b37">Fehr and Gintis 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,307.84,132.48,69.33,8.58;4,65.25,144.49,51.88,8.58">Kronenberg and Kalter 2012Þ</ref>, and over the years, the debate on the problem of collective action has expanded to include aspects that transcend its original formulation ðGould 1993; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,146.89,168.48,113.25,8.58" target="#b83">Marwell and Oliver 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,264.36,168.48,76.84,8.58" target="#b61">Heckathorn 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,345.43,168.48,31.70,8.58;4,65.25,180.49,22.34,8.58" target="#b93">Ostrom 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,90.48,180.49,72.81,8.58">Baldassarri 2009Þ</ref>. Various solutions have been advanced to explain how individuals could possibly overcome collective action problems. Here, I organize them along two analytical dimensions: ðaÞ the motives actors have for cooperation and ðbÞ the beliefs actors hold about others' behavior. In general, the mechanisms here identified should not be simply considered as cognitive or motivational, because they are also affected by actors' expectations about other actors and by their definition of the situation ðcf. Ostrom's ½2010 concept of "action situation"Þ. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,247.18,263.33,3.00,4.58">3</ref> Motives Scholars have ranged the entire spectrum from selfish to altruistic behavior in discussing the motives actors have for cooperation. Without necessarily abandoning the assumption of self-interested actors, scholars have advanced solutions to the collective action problem based on selective incentives ðOlson 1965Þ, as well as population heterogeneity and the shape of the production function ðMarwell and Oliver 1993Þ. On the opposite side of the motivation spectrum, there are arguments and empirical evidence supporting the altruistic, prosocial nature of human behavior ðFehr and Gächter 2002; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,125.63,408.46,80.17,8.58">Henrich et al. 2006Þ</ref>. Finally, evolutionary models have often relied on the heterogeneity of social preferences, arguing that cooperation in society may be due to a balance between egoistic and altruistic types ðOstrom 2000; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,128.41,444.46,95.87,8.58">Fehr and Gintis 2007Þ.</ref> In between purely selfish and purely altruistic alternatives, there are intermediate solutions based on the idea that individuals do not act solely on the basis of selfish motivations but tend to include other-regarding preferences in their cost-benefit calculation, to reflect their level of inequity aversion ðFehr and Schmidt 1999; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,213.96,504.50,163.11,8.58">Barr, Lindelow, and Sernees 2009Þ, or</ref> their attachment toward kin, social groups, or members of their social networks ðGould 1993; <ref type="bibr" coords="5,153.35,72.49,102.89,8.58" target="#b73">Kim and Bearman 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,258.41,72.49,76.51,8.58">Chen and Li 2009Þ</ref>. Social life is in fact regulated by norms of fairness that constrain selfish <ref type="bibr" coords="5,337.60,84.46,24.29,8.58;5,54.99,95.68,113.01,10.00">behavior ðDurkheim ½1893 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,176.03,96.48,64.11,8.58" target="#b23">Coleman 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,243.72,96.48,51.30,8.58" target="#b31">Elster 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,298.60,96.48,68.14,8.58;5,54.99,108.49,69.37,8.58">Baldassarri and Grossman 2013Þ</ref>. Recent studies have demonstrated that generosity increases as the social distance between ego and alter diminishes. Individuals are most generous toward people they are directly connected to and exhibit greater prosocial behavior toward people who are a few steps removed in their social network ðe.g., friends of friendsÞ than toward more distant others <ref type="bibr" coords="5,54.99,167.68,80.65,10.00">ðLeider et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,138.72,168.48,108.59,8.58" target="#b17">Brañas-Garza et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,250.41,168.48,78.99,8.58" target="#b49">Goeree et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,332.50,168.48,34.25,8.58;5,54.99,180.50,43.55,8.58">Apicella et al. 2012Þ</ref>. More generally, individuals are more generous toward in-group than out-group members. In-group favoritism has been observed not only in field settings where group membership is based on ascribed categories, such as, for instance, ethnicity ðWhitt and Wilson 2007Þ and religion ðAdida, Laitin, and Valfort 2010Þ, but also in cases in which group membership was randomly assigned ðGoette, Huffman, and Meier 2006Þ, and even in laboratory settings where scholars induced "minimal" or trivial group identities ðTajfel and Turner 1979; <ref type="bibr" coords="5,163.33,264.46,96.62,8.58" target="#b15">Bohnet and Frey 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,262.54,264.46,81.92,8.58;5,344.41,263.33,3.00,4.58">Chen and Li 2009Þ. 4</ref> In this research I consider two types of motives that deviate from selfish behavior: generalized altruism, which identifies prosocial behavior toward unidentified "others," and group solidarity, which identifies prosocial behavior toward members of one's social group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expectations</head><p>The second relevant dimension in the analysis of collective action dilemmas concerns the expectations actors hold about others. Under certain conditions, cooperation can emerge even among self-interested actors. And, on the contrary, "even if people's motives are not unquestioningly egoistic, cooperation might still encounter many obstacles" ðGambetta 1988, p. 216Þ. For instance, in the classic prisoner's dilemma situation, the expectation that the other actor would defect might actually induce a potentially cooperative actor to defect as well. "The problem, therefore, is essentially one of communication: even if people have perfectly adequate motives for cooperation they still need to know about each other's motives and to trust each other, or at least the effectiveness of their motives. It is necessary not only to trust 4 Analytically, it is important to note that in-group favoritism can be brought about by two distinct, although interdependent, processes: social proximity, which is related to the frequency of interaction and the nature of the relationship between actors, and group attachment, which derives from the strength of one's identification with a group ðBaldassarri and Grossman 2013Þ. Though both social proximity and group attachment may lead to in-group favoritism, proximity is based on particularized past experiences, while group attachment derives from a process of categorization in which individuals generalize their interpersonal experiences to a broader class of alters and relate to others even in the absence of a personal relationship ðTajfel and Turner 1979Þ. others before acting cooperatively, but also to believe that one is trusted by others" ðGambetta 1988, p. 216Þ.</p><p>Almost all formal models of collective action subsequent to Olson's ð1965Þ seminal work included some form of interdependence between actors. Interdependence, in most conditions, reduces the uncertainty ego faces about alter's behavior, thus making it easier to establish whether alter will cooperate or not, as well as to persuade alter of ego's cooperative intentions. Repeated interaction represents the simplest form of interdependence and can in itself foster cooperative behavior by allowing reciprocity to evolve, as demonstrated by Axelrod's ð1984Þ evolution of cooperation via a two-person iterated prisoner's dilemma ði.e., Rapoport's tit-for-tat strategyÞ. While in a one-shot interaction individuals might benefit from selfish behavior, in repeated interaction, defection might no longer be the best strategy for a selfregarding actor, because his defection might lead to alter's defection in future interactions. The successful strategy in the longer run is to elicit cooperation from the other actor.</p><p>Mechanisms of direct ðA → B, B → AÞ and indirect ðA → B, B → CÞ reciprocity predicated on the same logic have acquired a central role in evolutionary biology in recent years, as they are often used to explain altruistic behavior toward nonkin and the evolution of cooperation in relatively large social groups ðTrivers 1971; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,186.90,312.48,116.09,8.58">Nowak and Sigmund 2005Þ</ref>. Similarly, social exchange theorists have highlighted the consequences of reciprocal and generalized exchange on collective outcomes ðYamagishi and Cook 1993; Bearman 1997; Molm 2010Þ. It should be noticed that reciprocity, as conceived here, does not necessarily require actors to carry other-regarding preferences. Indeed, in the context of repeated interaction, reciprocity might constitute the most effective behavior even for a fully selfish actor.</p><p>Mechanisms of direct and indirect reciprocity may emerge through contact between actors, since communication could enable individuals to coordinate, persuade, precommit, and signal trustworthiness. Although verbal commitment is not binding, in certain instances communication has been shown to be sufficient to trigger cooperation, by affecting the beliefs actors have about each other's behavior ðOstrom, Walker, and Gardner 1992Þ. Formal models of collective action that incorporate a network structure ðGould 1993; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,125.46,480.46,108.73,8.58">Kim and Bearman 1997Þ</ref> as well as threshold models and cascades ðGranovetter 1978; Macy 1991; Watts and Dodds 2007Þ often rely on this mechanism.</p><p>However, as forcefully argued by rational choice theory scholars, communication is not binding and can actually be deceptive-it is "cheap talk"-and thus may not necessarily affect actors' behavior or lead to Pareto-efficient outcomes ðFarrell and Rabin 1996Þ. Monetary and social sanctioning is often considered to be a more effective mechanism to foster cooperation in a context of repeated interaction ðFehr and Gächter 2002; Sigmund 2007Þ. The threat of a fine, loss of reputation, or exclusion from the group serves as a deterrent from free riding because these sanctions change individuals' payoff function, increasing the cost of defection ðObershall 1973 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,96.32,108.49,4.44,8.58">;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,104.88,108.49,76.03,8.58" target="#b61">Heckathorn 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,185.10,108.49,51.69,8.58">Willer 2009Þ</ref>. Moreover, the presence of a sanctioning system also serves as a reassurance for potential cooperators that defection would not go unpunished and thereby strengthen people's beliefs that others would cooperate. Coercion is a way "to circumscribe the extent to which we need to trust agents or cope with them in case of distrust" ðGambetta 1988, p. 220Þ.</p><p>In addition to generalized altruism and group solidarity, in this research I consider two other mechanisms that might lead to greater cooperation in a context of repeated interaction: reciprocity based on verbal commitment and the threat of sanctioning. Both mechanisms affect the beliefs actors have about other actors' behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scope Conditions</head><p>These mechanisms are derived from different theories of collective action that span a few disciplines and, unfortunately, have been seldom compared to each other. A discussion of their scope conditions is also missing. For sure, from a theoretical standpoint, generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity, and the threat of sanctioning are not mutually exclusive; indeed, several instances of collective action may be brought about by a combination of these mechanisms ðOstrom 2005Þ. Moreover, instead of comparing them in the abstract, we should specify their scope conditions by identifying the actual collective action forms and contexts in which they are more likely to operate.</p><p>First of all, all these mechanisms generally apply to small and mediumsize groups in which horizontal, decentralized solutions to collective action problems emerge more easily. Instead, in large groups ðe.g., countries, large marketsÞ, centralized solutions ðe.g., the police, taxation, central banksÞ are often necessary ðScholz and Gray 1997; but see Nee and Opper ½2012 for an exceptionÞ.</p><p>While scope conditions are rarely discussed, we can infer them from the substantive research areas from which these theories have originated. Scholars stressing the importance of group solidarity and interpersonal influence are often concerned with instances of collective action that are political in nature ðe.g., volunteering, protest mobilization, political partici-pationÞ, where group dynamics and the symbolic meaning of the collective goal may accrue disproportionate importance over instrumental considerations ðBearman 1991; <ref type="bibr" coords="7,157.83,552.46,52.86,8.58">Gould 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,214.92,552.46,113.39,8.58">Diani and McAdam 2003Þ</ref>. This is especially the case when considering high-risk forms of collective action, such as in the case of participation in violent protests, revolutions, or suicide Cooperative Networks missions, in which the effect of peer pressure and the importance of group solidarity are fundamental in explaining participation ðMcAdam 1986; <ref type="bibr" coords="8,65.25,96.48,70.81,8.58">Gambetta 2005Þ.</ref> Although recognizing the importance of group membership and shared norms, studies that examine collective action problems in the context of primarily economic activities have instead focused mainly on instrumental reasons; consider, for instance, the vast literature on common-pool resources, which addresses problems of overuse of resources such as fisheries, pastures, water, atmosphere, and so forth ðHardin 1968; Ostrom 1990Þ. In this context, a system for monitoring and sanctioning is usually regarded as the most effective solution to collective action problems ðFehr and Gächter 2002 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,83.12,204.48,4.47,8.58">;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,90.59,204.48,61.93,8.58" target="#b19">Camerer 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,155.45,204.48,107.56,8.58" target="#b59">Habyarimana et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,265.95,204.48,62.53,8.58">Sigmund 2007Þ</ref>. However, the empirical work of Elinor Ostrom and her collaborators also greatly contributed to show that communication and mechanisms of reciprocity help promote and sustain cooperation, either by themselves or in combination with peer sanctioning ðOstrom et al. 1992; Ostrom 2010Þ. In addition, group size and heterogeneity are likely to affect which of these mechanisms is more effective. Namely, as the size ðor heterogeneityÞ of the group increases and connections become sparser, reciprocity based on communication becomes more difficult to sustain, and sanctioning mechanisms must be put in place to discourage free riding ðRuttan 2008; Poteete, Janssen, and Ostrom 2010Þ.</p><p>Finally, explanations of collective action based on generalized altruism may be advanced in the presence of strong selection ðor self-selectionÞ processes, in which "altruistic types" combine their cooperative efforts, for example, in the case of volunteering. In addition, differences in levels of generalized altruism or in the proportion of altruistic types in a population are sometimes useful to understand cross-cultural comparisons, and it is probably at this macrolevel that this type of explanation is most effective ðYamagishi, <ref type="bibr" coords="8,118.99,408.46,102.40,8.58" target="#b116">Cook, and Watabe 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,223.42,408.46,76.05,8.58" target="#b64">Henrich et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,305.97,408.46,17.88,8.58">Henrich et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,330.35,408.46,46.82,8.58;8,65.25,420.48,112.14,8.58">Herrmann, Thóni, and Gächter 2008Þ.</ref> NETWORKS, SOCIAL CAPITAL, AND PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR Social networks may be implicated in all the mechanisms discussed so far, although the way in which networks could matter is different for each of them. Let us consider group solidarity. As reviewed before, social ties to and from alters contribute to shaping ego's motives and his or her otherregarding preferences. The mechanism of group solidarity is indeed predicated on the idea that the extent to which ego takes into account alters' welfare is a function of ego's social distance from alter ðTajfel and Turner 1979Þ. Norms of fairness toward a social group depend on the attachment and frequency of exposure to the members of the group ðGoette et al. 2006; <ref type="bibr" coords="8,65.25,576.50,103.74,8.58" target="#b111">Whitt and Wilson 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,172.57,576.50,140.35,8.58">Baldassarri and Grossman 2013Þ</ref>. For instance, the extent to which people would forgo possible gains to benefit family members or close friends is usually greater than if they were to sacrifice for their coworkers or casual acquaintances. We can therefore expect that the more connections one has to members of a group and the more embedded he is in such a group, the more he is likely to develop group solidarity and behave prosocially toward members of such a group.</p><p>The relation between social network position and generalized altruism is instead less obvious. There is experimental evidence suggesting that having social ties that extend beyond the family and a close circle of friends is likely to induce greater trust in strangers, while intense family and group ties prevent trust from developing beyond group boundaries ðErmisch and Gambetta 2010; Yamagishi 2011Þ. Similarly, network centrality has been found to be associated with greater trusting and trustworthy behavior in an investment game ðBarr, Ensminger, and Johnson 2009Þ. It is possible to expect other-regarding preferences to be similarly affected. Namely, individuals with more extensive and outreaching networks may display greater levels of generalized altruism. Extant scholarship relating network centrality to generosity and cooperative behavior offers rather mixed empirical evidence ðD'Exelle and Riedl 2010; <ref type="bibr" coords="9,227.22,288.50,83.35,8.58">Apicella et al. 2012Þ</ref>. One should also consider a reversed causality pattern: namely, altruistic individuals may be more likely to have broad social networks. Either way, we cannot exclude, a priori, the possibility of a relationship between social network position and generalized altruism.</p><p>Let us now consider how networks can affect the remaining two mechanisms: reciprocity based on communication and the threat of sanctioning. Social networks govern actors' interdependence and favor repeated interaction, thus contributing to determining ego's beliefs about alters' motives. Social networks are pipelines through which individuals exchange information. They also enable mechanisms of interpersonal influence and peer pressure. Patterns of relationship are therefore vital for the development of forms of direct and indirect reciprocity ðNowak and Sigmund 2005; Apicella et al. 2012Þ. Similarly, sanctioning systems are often more effective in the presence of interpersonal relationships, which allow for better enforcement and greater social control ðColeman 1988; <ref type="bibr" coords="9,224.93,468.50,45.01,8.58" target="#b56">Greif 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,271.75,468.50,95.06,8.58;9,54.99,480.46,22.35,8.58" target="#b39">Fershtman and Gneezy 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,79.93,480.46,66.62,8.58">Sigmund 2007Þ.</ref> In the light of these considerations, it becomes clear that assessing the relationship between social networks and prosocial behavior is not sufficient in order to determine the building blocks of cooperation. If one wants to understand the mechanisms through which cooperation emerges in a specific social setting, it is important to focus on how patterns of social relations affect actors' motives ði.e., increasing group solidarity or generalized altruismÞ or their expectations about others' behavior ði.e., facilitating reciprocity and sanctioning mechanismsÞ.</p><p>Advancements in this direction would contribute not only to the research on collective action but also to the large scholarship on social capital. Although it is beyond the scope of this section to cover the various strands of this popular concept in the social sciences, 5 it should suffice to say that, at their core, most conceptions of social capital stem from the idea that social relationships and associational life can positively affect individual and group outcomes. 6 Unfortunately, most scholars have based their arguments on the generic assumption that social capital nurtures trust and norms of reciprocity, without specifying the microlevel mechanisms through which social capital informs social and economic behavior ðsee, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="10,330.91,180.49,46.16,8.58;10,65.25,192.46,22.34,8.58" target="#b44">Fukuyama 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,89.91,192.46,57.39,8.58">Putnam 2000Þ</ref>. These macrolevel and cultural approaches quite often also rely on tautological explanations and fail to analytically distinguish between social capital and its consequences ðfor an account of these problems, see Portes ½1998 and Abascal and Baldassarri ½2015Þ.</p><p>In contrast, scholars who have devoted attention to the microlevel mechanisms at the basis of social capital's positive outcomes ðPortes 1998; <ref type="bibr" coords="10,362.15,252.50,14.88,8.58;10,65.25,264.46,49.03,8.58" target="#b79">Lin et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,118.60,264.46,46.65,8.58" target="#b18">Burt 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,169.62,264.46,133.90,8.58">Durlauf and Fafchamps 2005Þ</ref> tend to adopt a framework similar to the one discussed in the previous section. For instance, in his widely cited review of the literature, Portes ð1998Þ points to the relational nature of social capital: it is the fact that alters will behave according to certain norms of conduct that allows ego to secure benefits through his social network. Moreover, Portes organizes the sources of social capital into two broad categories: consummatory sources, which are based on mechanisms of value introjection or bounded solidarity at the community level, and instrumental sources, based instead on norms of reciprocity and enforceable trust. These four mechanisms closely resemble the four mechanisms considered in this research.</p><p>In sum, both collective action and social capital scholarship suggest that there are multiple ways in which social networks may affect collective outcomes and cooperation. Identifying which mechanism is at work, that is, generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity based on verbal commitment, or the threat of sanctioning, is crucial in order to understand the contextual and institutional factors that bring about cooperation in specific social settings. 5 Social capital has become a very popular concept in the social sciences in the last 20 years, with wide application in sociology ðColeman 1990; <ref type="bibr" coords="10,273.48,500.85,43.90,7.29" target="#b97">Portes 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,319.75,500.85,53.61,7.29">Lin et al. 2001Þ</ref>, as well as political science ðFukuyama 1995; <ref type="bibr" coords="10,230.11,510.37,93.90,7.29" target="#b41">Foley and Edwards 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,326.72,510.37,50.36,7.29" target="#b99">Putnam 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,65.25,519.84,67.85,7.29">Krishna 2002Þ and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,135.83,519.16,99.58,8.50">economics ðWoolcock 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,238.11,519.84,108.30,7.29">Durlauf and Fafchamps 2005Þ</ref>. Its diffusion testifies to its appeal in explaining social processes. Simultaneously, social capital has also become an all-encompassing concept, often vaguely defined and carelessly deployed. 6 As Portes puts it, social capital can be defined as "the ability of actors ½individuals or groups to secure benefits by virtue of membership in social networks or other social structures" ð1998, p. 6Þ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEHAVIORAL GAMES AND LAB-IN-THE-FIELD EXPERIMENTS</head><p>Motives and expectations are not immediately observable. However, it is possible to infer them from the way people behave in controlled, experimental settings, and in behavioral games ðBGsÞ in particular. BGs are abstract situations in which individuals have to allocate resources between themselves and other players. BGs are uniquely suited to capture actors' interdependence in decision making, because in order to define their own strategies, participants must take into account their expectations concerning the behavior of other players.</p><p>Despite the scarce use of BGs in sociology ðwhich, I believe, is partly due to their initial association with economics and rational choice theoryÞ, in recent years there has been an interesting evolution in the use of BGs that has made them a promising tool for the social sciences, and sociology in particular. 7 Initially, behavioral experiments were developed to reveal general patterns of human behavior ðMarwell and Ames 1979; <ref type="bibr" coords="11,327.06,243.48,39.68,8.58;11,54.99,255.50,60.37,8.58" target="#b36">Fehr and Gächter 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,119.11,255.50,62.68,8.58">Camerer 2003Þ</ref>, using convenience samples ðoften college studentsÞ and experimental settings and protocols that guaranteed complete anonymity and, as much as possible, "stripped" participants of their background characteristics and experiences. Over the last two decades, however, some scholars have shifted their interest toward macrocultural variations and started to play BGs with diverse populations around the world ðHenrich et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,146.66,327.50,17.88,8.58" target="#b21">2001</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,196.89,327.50,92.77,8.58" target="#b67">Herrmann et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,292.42,327.50,69.97,8.58">Yamagishi 2011Þ</ref>. Finally, in the last 10 years, BGs have started to be used to measure individual and group differences that stem from microcontextual variations as well as personal and group experiences ðBarr 2003; <ref type="bibr" coords="11,266.28,363.44,100.57,8.58;11,54.98,375.46,70.78,8.58" target="#b20">Carpenter, Daniere, and Takahashi 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,129.14,375.46,55.34,8.58" target="#b71">Karlan 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,187.93,375.46,178.89,8.58" target="#b35">Fearon, Humphreys, and Weinstein 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,54.98,387.48,122.81,8.58" target="#b32">Ermisch and Gambetta 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,180.17,387.48,136.20,8.58" target="#b58">Grossman and Baldassarri 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,318.67,387.48,48.11,8.58;11,54.98,399.44,85.22,8.58">Baldassarri and Grossman 2013Þ</ref>. This last development is critical: that BGs have been shown to be sufficiently sensitive to detect differences between individuals within a society makes them an exceptionally powerful tool for research in those fields of sociology that rely on "hard-to-measure" concepts such as trust, authority, altruism, reciprocity, and solidarity, among others.</p><p>Second, the shift in BGs' use from a tool to detect universal patterns of human behavior to a measurement instrument that allows researchers to capture individual and group differences has made the identity and "reallife" experiences of the game participants an integral part of the research design and has led to a move from the aseptic walls of an experimental lab 7 While a certain skepticism regarding the origins of BGs is understandable, most of the criticisms that motivated the disciplinary rejection of rational choice theory do not apply to more recent use of BGs. Moreover, and quite ironically, behavioral experiments have greatly contributed to the debunking of some basic assumptions at the basis of rational choice theory. to natural settings. In general, lab-in-the-field behavioral experiments have greater external validity than lab-based BGs ðLevitt and List 2007; Jones 2010Þ, because they are carried out with subjects in their natural settings, retaining, to the greatest possible degree, their social identities and context. Moreover, when combined with observational data, they greatly facilitate the inferential process, the identification of social mechanisms, and, under certain conditions, the assessment of causal effects ðBaldassarri and Grossman 2011; Grossman and Baldassarri 2012Þ.</p><p>Adopting this new framework, I used lab-in-the-field BGs to measure farmer group members' levels of generalized altruism and group solidarity, as well as their cooperation propensity under reciprocity and threat of sanctioning conditions. The full script of the behavioral games is available in the online appendix. Namely, I used different variants of the dictator game ðDGÞ to differentiate between different motives for prosocial behavior. Traditionally, in a classic DG, two subjects are given a common endowment. One of the players, randomly chosen, has to decide how to divide the money between himself or herself and the other player, the receiver. Deciders keep to themselves whatever they have decided to allocate to themselves, while the receivers take home whatever they have been given. The DG is conducted under conditions of anonymity. If deciders were completely selfish, they would keep the entire endowment to themselves. In contrast, individuals share, on average, between 20% and 30% of their endowment. A few share up to half, whereas the modal behavior is to give nothing. Behavior in a DG is usually interpreted as an expression of otherregarding preferences ðor inequality aversionÞ and used to classify individuals as selfish or altruistic types ðCamerer 2003; <ref type="bibr" coords="12,289.30,372.46,87.87,8.58;12,65.25,384.48,60.44,8.58;12,125.68,383.29,3.00,4.58">Barr, Lindelow, and Sernees 2009Þ. 8</ref> Although some people are more altruistic than others, individuals are not universally altruistic or selfish. In contrast, a few studies have documented that prosocial behavior is contingent on the perceived social distance between the giver and the receiver. By changing the information set about the actors, scholars have tested whether norms of fairness vary as a function of the recipient's identity and the level of anonymity of the sender. Some studies have elicited more or less fictional group identities in laboratory settings ðBohnet and Frey 1999Þ, while others have shown the positive effect of group identification on prosocial behavior with respect to ascribed categories, such as ethnicity and gender ðWhitt and Wilson 2007; 8 Some scholars have argued that behavior in DGs can be influenced by social norms ðe.g., individuals do what the average person will doÞ and suggested that individuals might have different preferences but prefer to follow group norms ðKonow 2010Þ. In this article, I interpret individuals' behavior in a DG as an indicator of their level of prosocial behavior and remain agnostic as to whether this behavior reflects individuals' preferences or is in part affected by social norms.  <ref type="bibr" coords="13,159.99,132.48,81.70,8.58">Apicella et al. 2012Þ</ref>. In this research, I follow the strategy of changing the identity of the recipient to distinguish between generalized altruism and group solidarity. Namely, participants will be asked to divide their endowment between themselves and a stranger, to measure their level of generalized altruism, and between themselves and a member of their farmer group, to measure their group solidarity.</p><p>I use different versions of an iterated public goods game ðPGGÞ to study the evolution of cooperation under different conditions of interdependence. In a classic PGG, participants anonymously decide how to split an initial endowment between private and public accounts. What players put in the private account remains theirs, while what is contributed to the public account is doubled and redistributed evenly among all group members, regardless of their level of contribution. The most profitable outcome for the group occurs when all players contribute their entire endowment. Nonetheless, regardless of what other people contribute, the most profitable strategy for the individual is to keep the entire endowment in his private account and benefit from what everyone else contributes to the public account. Designed to induce a social dilemma, PGGs capture how players balance selfinterest and the well-being of the group ðCamerer 2003Þ.</p><p>Experimental evidence shows that in PGGs participants initially contribute, on average, between 40% and 60% of their endowment. In repeated games, however, conditional cooperators who wish to avoid being exploited by free riders gradually refrain from cooperation, leading to a drop in contributions in subsequent rounds ðOstrom 2000; Fischbacher, Gächter, and Fehr 2001Þ. By contrast, when participants are allowed to punish other subjects, overall levels of contributions increase, since conditional cooperators can discipline defectors ðLubell and Scholz 2001; <ref type="bibr" coords="13,265.12,444.46,101.59,8.58" target="#b36">Fehr and Gächter 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,54.99,456.48,73.94,8.58">Gintis et al. 2005Þ</ref>. While sanctioning is widely considered the most common solution to collective action problems, scholars have also shown that face-to-face communication produces substantial increases in cooperation, thus disconfirming the rational choice expectation that communication without binding commitment is "cheap talk" and would not have any effect on cooperation ðOstrom et al. 1992 <ref type="bibr" coords="13,184.84,516.46,4.47,8.58">;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,191.68,516.46,142.08,8.58" target="#b42">Frank, Gilovich, and Regan 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,336.19,516.46,30.69,8.58;13,54.99,528.48,67.53,8.58">Bohnet and Frey 1999Þ.</ref> In this research, I implement a communication variant of the PGG to test whether repeated interaction is per se capable of leading members of producer organizations to greater levels of cooperation, and I implement a centralized sanctioning variant to measure the extent to which group members are sensitive to the threat of sanctioning.</p></div>

State withdrawal ðBates 1981Þ and the ðrelativeÞ democratization of public life in many developing countries have encouraged the rapid proliferation of local-level, voluntary-based organizations, which are created to provide collective goods to their members. This proliferation was also driven by the active support of the World Bank, international nongovernmental organizations, and other agencies, which have been working since the mid-1990s with a paradigm that stresses the positive effects of participatory and community-driven development, decentralization, and social capital on development ðHussi 1993; <ref type="bibr" coords="14,179.26,207.48,99.47,8.58">Stockbridge et al. 2003Þ</ref>.</p><p>Early rural development studies aimed mainly at showing the benefits of organizing farmers ðDeininger 1995Þ, while more recent scientific research has increasingly focused on intervention design and the comparison of different intervention strategies, often relying on randomized evaluation ðBingen, Serrano, and Howard 2003; Banerjee and Duflo 2010Þ. Instead of focusing on average intervention effects or variation across interventions, this article focuses on within-intervention variation and aims at identifying the endogenous social factors that affect the level of success of an intervention. The farmer organizations that are the object of this study were all created by the same development intervention and were given very similar organizational structures, directives, and goals. However, the rate of success greatly varied across farmer groups, and such variation in outcomes is not accounted for by preexisting conditions ðlike the level of development of the areaÞ, the physical characteristics of the land ðe.g., elevation, rainfall, and quality of soilÞ, or ethnic and cultural differences. My working hypothesis is that emerging patterns of social relations have helped certain farmer organizations to overcome collective action problems by facilitating the spread of information, trust, and accountability practices.</p><p>Development scholars have already documented the role of social capital in reducing the effects of poverty and inequalities by showing how informal relations and voluntary organizations can favor the spontaneous creation of protection systems and help to overcome collective action problems ðCollier 1998; <ref type="bibr" coords="14,148.36,483.47,97.28,8.58" target="#b48">Gittell and Vidal 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,248.65,483.47,128.41,8.58" target="#b57">Grootaert and Bastelaer 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,65.25,495.48,59.33,8.58">Krishna 2002Þ</ref>, facilitate the diffusion of information and adoption of agricultural innovations ðFafchamps and Minten 1999; <ref type="bibr" coords="14,287.32,507.45,89.76,8.58;14,65.25,518.67,161.65,10.00">Isham 2000Þ, develop microcredit programs ðKhandker 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,234.65,519.47,53.07,8.58">Yunus 1998Þ</ref>, and foster civic engagement and the democratic process ðGittell and Vidal 1998; Carrol 2001Þ. Despite its achievements, the economic development research has important limitations. Mostly dominated by a macro ðor functionalistÞ approach to social capital, this research rarely goes beyond the intuition that "better-connected people do better" to investigate the actual network characteristics from which individuals derive their positional advantage ðSobel 2002Þ. In addition, scholars base their arguments on the generic assumption that social capital nurtures trust and norms of reciprocity, without specifying the mechanisms through which social capital operates or trust is produced. Finally, the measurement of the concept is far from satisfying. Scholars usually rely on survey-based measures of trust and membership in formal and informal associations, while more appropriate measurements-that is, be For its scope, relative uniformity of the intervention, and focus on collective marketing, the Agriculture Productivity Enhancement Project ðAPEPÞ offers an extraordinary opportunity to study the building blocks of economic cooperation. 9 One of Uganda's largest recent rural development interventions, APEP helped organize over 60,000 farmers into about 2,500 villagelevel groups ðknown as producer organizations, or POsÞ between 2004 and 2009. These groups were further organized into more than 200 farmer associations ðknown as depot committees, or DCsÞ serving, on average, 200 members from 10 neighboring POs. 10 The process of group formation occurred under the guidance of a few project field trainers. As a consequence, APEP groups have similar organizational and governance structure. All strategic decisions are made at the DC level by a farmer association council, which is led by a few executives-usually a manager, chairperson, and secretary-under the supervision of two elected farmer representatives per <ref type="bibr" coords="15,71.32,396.49,16.24,8.58;15,87.42,395.31,6.01,4.58">PO. 11</ref> The goal of these farmer associations was to support the integration of small-holder producers into commercial farming by exploiting economies of scale, increasing productivity, and bargaining for better prices. Their major activity was collective marketing, also referred to as "bulking," or selling in bulk. Given the high costs of transportation and market information, in the absence of POs, small farmers' only option is to sell their crops to local middlemen, who likely exploit information asymmetries and bargaining power, offering unorganized farmers below-market prices. By contrast, organized farmers can bypass these middlemen and obtain higher prices through collective marketing ðStaatz 1987Þ.</p><p>Thus, the most common problem for small producers in rural Uganda ðas well as in many other underdeveloped regions around the worldÞ is to bypass these speculative middlemen and sell their products at competitive market prices. Some of the farmer organizations were able to achieve high levels of collective marketing; others did not. Depending on their success, these organizations were also able to provide several other services, from training to input procurement ðe.g., buying seedlings, fertilizers, and herbicides in bulkÞ, and offer small loans to their members.</p><p>Though highly valuable, most of these activities are subjected to various social dilemmas. First of all, these groups have to overcome coordination problems. For instance, in order to sell their crop in bulk, farmers need to agree on a place, day, and time in which all of them will convene to a central location to pool their produce. Second, they have to overcome threshold problems, which are situations in which a sufficient number of other participants is needed for the collective activity to become beneficial. For instance, renting a truck to bring the crop to the market becomes convenient only if a sufficient number of other farmers share its cost. Similarly, switching to a more remunerative crop ðe.g., coffeeÞ becomes convenient only if enough other farmers actually do the same.</p><p>Finally, they have to overcome the quintessential social dilemma, the free-rider problem, which is a situation in which everybody would benefit from the provision of a public good, but it is better if others bear the cost of its provision. Collective marketing offers a good example of how these farmer groups constantly face free-rider problems. Through collective marketing, farmer organizations can sell their produce directly to buyers in major markets, bypassing the local middleman. Once a farmer group is in place, however, local middlemen tend to raise their offers to remain competitive. Since middlemen, unlike most farmer groups, collect crops at the farmers' gate and pay cash on delivery, members have a private interest in selling to middlemen. 12 The private gain of selling to middlemen ð"defecting"Þ, however, is conditional on a sufficient number of other members selling their crops via the farmer group ð"cooperating"Þ. Yet, if too many members defect, collective marketing collapses, and the middlemen will lower their price. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,361.07,71.31,6.01,4.58">13</ref> Farmer organizations face the free-rider problems in other situations as well. For instance, to increase the quality of their crop, and therefore the selling price, farmers have to use fertilizers and follow labor-intensive procedures, such as handpicking coffee beans, drying them on specific carpets, and so forth. Since farmers mix their coffee and then sell it collectively, the overall quality of the produce depends on everybody's effort. Thus, individual farmers face a constant trade-off between working hard to increase the quality of their produce and instead free riding on the work of others.</p><p>A stratified, random, multistage cluster design was used to sample research participants. 14 First, I sampled 50 farmer organizations ðDCsÞ. Within each organization, all the members of the farmer association council were interviewed ðN 5 1,447Þ. Although the research also included a representative sample of farmers that were drawn from six POs per DC, results reported in this article concern members of the DC councils exclusively. Each council member was surveyed in person by trained interviewers in the respondents' language ði.e., Basoga, Luganda, and RanyankoleÞ and participated in a series of BGs. The surveys included a social network module that provides complete network information for each of the 50 farmer councils in the sample. Additional information about the farmer organization was collected in group interviews with the DC executives. Data on the DCs' economic activities were also assembled from the associations' books and records when available. 15</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expectations</head><p>In light of the previous discussion on the building blocks of cooperation and their scope conditions, which are the mechanisms that make it possible to overcome free-rider problems in the context of Ugandan farmer cooperatives? Given the economic nature of the activity of these farmer groups, I expect instrumental considerations, and thus mechanisms of reciprocity based on verbal commitment and the threat of sanctioning, to play a leading role. Research on regular farmer members has shown that sanctioning and leader's legitimacy play an important role in explaining cooperation rates ðGrossman and Baldassarri 2012Þ. While regular members do not maintain stable relationships with each other, nor do they participate directly in the activity of the council, the subjects of the current analysis are active members of the DC councils and experience repeated interaction with other members of the farmer group on a regular basis; thus, they may have developed mechanisms of reciprocity based on verbal commitments. The small size of DC councils may also enhance the capacity of direct communication and even make it more effective than sanctioning ðOstrom 2010Þ.</p><p>In addition, given their commitment to represent their villages in the farmer cooperatives meetings, one can also expect that they have developed a meaningful identification with the farmer organization, which could lead to greater group solidarity. Instead, we should not expect generalized altruism to be an explanation for different rates of cooperation across farmer cooperatives. In fact, on the basis of the information collected at the regional and farmer group levels, there is no reason to believe that cooperative types are differently distributed across villages nor that they would join the farmer groups at different rates. In other words, in the absence of specific selection processes, generalized altruism should not make a difference at the group level. However, I do not exclude this possibility a priori; thus I included experimental measures of generalized altruism in the data collection, and I control for levels of generalized altruism in the analyses.</p></div>

I then use lab-in-the-field experiments to distinguish different mechanisms ði.e., generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity, threat of sanctioningÞ that might account for the relationship between networks and collective outcomes. Finally, I relate individuals' behavior in the BG to their level of cooperation in real life to identify which mechanism is more likely to account for differences in levels of cooperation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Networks and Cooperation in the Producer Organization</head><p>Theories of collective action and social capital both suggest a relationship between social network structure and collective outcomes. In particular, network centralization and nonredundancy of network ties are considered to be network properties important for the provision of public goods ðGould 1993; <ref type="bibr" coords="18,90.54,552.46,109.26,8.58" target="#b83">Marwell and Oliver 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,202.73,552.46,48.82,8.58">Burt 2004Þ.</ref> In each of the 50 farmer organizations, I collected complete network information on the relationships among members of the DC council. Each member of the council was presented with the complete list of other members' names and, for each of them, was asked whether they speak frequently, consider alter a close friend, have his or her phone number, and go to him or her for advice. <ref type="bibr" coords="19,169.45,107.31,6.01,4.58">16</ref> For descriptive purposes, <ref type="figure" coords="19,287.09,107.69,31.82,10.00">figure 1</ref> reports the network structure of the advice network for six DCs.</p><p>For each of the four network relationships-speak, friendship, phone, advice-I consider four network measures: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and Burt's constraint. Degree centrality, or "total degree," is the simple count of in-and out-ties and is usually considered as a basic measure of ego's centrality, or popularity. Betweenness centrality is based on geodesic distance and captures the extent to which ego is instrumental in connecting otherwise disconnected alters, thus facilitating the flow of information and communication ðFreeman 1979Þ. Eigenvector centrality instead takes into account not only ego's degree but also the centrality of the people connected to him or her and is commonly interpreted as a measure of prestige ðBonacich 1972Þ. 17 Finally, Burt's constraint captures the extent to which individuals are embedded in redundant relationships, thus constraining their capacity to reach out to a large set of alters. Burt's constraint is higher if ego has fewer or mutually related ði.e., more redundantÞ ties ðBurt 2004Þ. <ref type="bibr" coords="19,122.96,299.33,5.84,4.58">18</ref> In general, my expectation is that the more central actors are in the farmer network, the more likely they will be to participate in the life of the farmer cooperative. <ref type="bibr" coords="19,161.17,323.31,5.84,4.58">19</ref> In contrast, high levels of constraint should lead to less cooperation, since individuals find themselves embedded in a limited set of relations.</p><p>While most studies connecting network features to collective outcomes rely on a single network, in this case I test this relationship on individuallevel observations coming from 50 different networks, thus making the findings more robust. We should, however, keep in mind that this part of <ref type="bibr" coords="19,54.99,430.35,6.00,4.58">16</ref> The questions for each of these are as follows: "Do you speak to ½NAME on a regular basis?" "Is ½NAME a close friend or do you just know him or her? By close friend, I mean that you ðaÞ eat together regularly; ðbÞ you can leave your child with him or her if you need to travel for several days; and ðcÞ he or she will help you in case of a family death." "Do you have ½NAME's phone number?" "In the past 12 months, have you asked ½NAME for information or advice on matters related to the farmer association?" 17 The eigenvector centrality of a node is its corresponding entry in the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of an adjacency matrix. While measures of centrality based on degree weight every contact equally, eigenvector centrality weights links according to their centralities. Eigenvector centrality can be conceived as a weighted sum of both direct and indirect connections and is a measure that takes into account the entire network structure. <ref type="bibr" coords="19,54.99,547.25,6.00,4.58">18</ref> Other measures have been considered, such as in-degree, out-degree, closeness, clustering coefficient, etc., and they lead to results that are similar to those presented here. 19 I used three different measures of centrality in order to assess the robustness of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIG. 1.-Example of advice networks in six DCs</head><p>the analysis is strictly descriptive. And since the network data have been collected at the same time as the outcome variables, we should also acknowledge the possible existence of a feedback loop: while, on the one hand, social relationships facilitate the emergence of cooperation, on the other hand, the experience of cooperation is likely to strengthen social relationships. The two effects cannot be decoupled with the data at my disposal, although there are reasons to believe that the latter is less pronounced.</p><p>There are two key collective outcomes that are particularly relevant for the life of the farmer organizations. The most important is the extent to which members sell their coffee through the producer organization. 20 On average, 70% of the members sold their coffee in bulk. There is, however, a fair amount of variation across DCs. In some producer organizations only a mere 10% of the members sell in bulk; in others, almost all of them rely on the producer organization. Our second measure concerns farmer participation in the life of the producer organization. In particular, we consider whether they attended the last general assembly. On average, almost threefourths of the members attended the assembly. <ref type="bibr" coords="21,253.92,263.33,6.01,4.58">21</ref> The correlation between these two measures is .23 ðP 5 .030Þ, suggesting that they are related but likely to capture different facets of cooperation in the farmer group.</p><p>I model the relationship between network position and cooperation using multilevel logistic regressions ðvarying-intercept modelsÞ in which individuals are nested within producer organizations ðDCÞ, and the probability of ðaÞ of selling via farmer group and ðbÞ participating in the general assembly is estimated as a function of network position, controlling for individuallevel characteristics, such as wealth, education, gender, age, and church attendance. 22 <ref type="figure" coords="21,64.97,384.48,36.52,8.58">Figure 2</ref> shows the percentage change in the probability of selling via farmer group ðpanel AÞ and participating in the general assembly ðpanel BÞ as a function of a 1-SD change in the network measure for every type of network. 23 Results show, for instance, that a 1-SD increase in betweenness centrality in the friendship network is related to a 4.5% ðconfidence interval 20 Here I use a binary variable. Similar results are obtained using the proportion of the crop that is sold in bulk. 21 Among regular members, 61% sell in bulk, and 57% attended the last general assembly. Thus, the behavior of the farmer representatives is slightly more "virtuous" than that of regular members, but not dramatically more so. ½CI 1-8Þ increase in the probability of selling one's coffee through the farmer association and a 10.2% ðCI 5-15.4Þ increase in the probability of attending the general assembly. In general, the results show that greater network centrality, in terms of number of ties, betweenness, and prestige, is associated with greater chances of cooperation, both with respect to selling in bulk and participating in the group activities, while having redundant ties is associated with a lower likelihood of cooperation. Individuals who span across a larger portion of the cooperative networks are more likely to bypass free-rider opportunities and contribute to public goods production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measuring Mechanisms with Lab-in-the-Field Experiments</head><p>Having assessed the relationship between social network position and cooperation, I turn now to consider the different mechanisms that might account for such a relationship. Local producers took part in lab-in-the-field BGs through which I measured their level of prosocial behavior, distinguishing between generalized altruism and group solidarity, and their cooperation propensity, distinguishing between a reciprocity mechanism based on communication and the threat of sanctioning. As described in the previous section, the DG is traditionally used to measure other-regarding behavior, as participants decide under conditions of anonymity and are not exposed to the risk of sanctioning or loss of reputation. The basic version of the DG, in which deciders have to divide the endowment between themselves and a stranger, is commonly used as a measure of generalized altruism, while versions of the DG in which the identity of the recipient is specified ðe.g., ethnicity, genderÞ have been used to measure prosocial behavior toward specific groups ðCamerer 2003; <ref type="bibr" coords="23,242.70,384.48,96.74,8.58" target="#b111">Whitt and Wilson 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,341.64,384.48,25.18,8.58;23,54.99,396.50,42.01,8.58">Adida et al. 2010Þ</ref>. In my lab-in-the-field DG, each farmer group member was invited to divide two endowments between herself or himself and two different alters, whose specific identity was to remain unknown. Each endowment was 10 coins of 100 Ugandan shillings ð10 monetary units, MUsÞ, which are equivalent to half a day's wage in rural Uganda.</p><p>In each of the 50 farmer groups, half of the participants were randomly assigned to an experimental variant in which participants had to divide a first endowment between themselves and a stranger and a second endowment between themselves and another member of the producer organization. The scenario in which people give to a stranger provides a measure of generalized altruism, while the scenario in which the recipient is a member of the producer association constitutes a measure of group solidarity. The expectation is, of course, that individuals would give more to a member of their group than to a stranger. However, the difference between the contribution to a stranger and the contribution to a group member might not necessarily be due to group Cooperative Networks solidarity per se; rather, it might simply reflect the fact that the social distance between giver and receiver is much smaller in the case of a group member than a stranger. To consider this possibility, the other half of the participants were assigned to a second variant of the DG, in which deciders divided their endowment with a stranger and, differently from the first variant, with someone from their village. 24 Overall, the familiarity and frequency of interaction with covillagers are similar to those with members of the farmer group. <ref type="bibr" coords="24,138.84,155.33,6.01,4.58">25</ref> If membership in the farmer organization has triggered a strong sense of group attachment, we would expect our subjects to show greater solidarity toward comembers than to covillagers ðsee online app. III for the DG scriptÞ. <ref type="figure" coords="24,75.23,204.48,36.86,8.58">Figure 3</ref> reports results for both variants of the DG. Confirming previous scholarship, respondents give, on average, almost 30% of their endowment to a stranger. More interestingly, compared to their contribution to strangers, group members give half a coin more to a covillager ð0.48 MU; P &lt; .001Þ and more than a coin to another member of the producer organization ð1.12 MUs; P &lt; .001Þ. Changing the identity of the recipient, namely, moving from a generalized other to a member of the in-group, increases contributions. Moreover, group members give 0.64 MU more to a comember than to a covillager ðP &lt; .001Þ, thus confirming the expectation that group solidarity among members of the farmer organization is triggered by a sense of attachment to the group that goes beyond mere familiarity with or exposure to the other members, as might be the case with covillagers. <ref type="table" coords="24,113.67,348.48,38.60,8.58" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> in the appendix reports results for the estimation of the average treatment effect in tabular form as obtained from a three-level random intercept linear regression model that controls for group and interviewers' effects.</p><p>The emergence of cooperation over repeated interaction is traditionally captured using PGGs. Accordingly, I run a lab-in-the-field PGG in order to assess the extent to which reciprocity through communication and the threat of sanctioning are mechanisms that affect farmer groups' cooperative capacity. 26 All farmer group members participated in six rounds of a PGG. In each round, they were endowed with 10 MUs and had to decide how much to keep for themselves and how much to put in a common pot, whose content would be doubled and redistributed equally among the 24 I also randomized the order in which subjects were confronted with the choices, asking half of the subjects to first allocate the endowment to a stranger and then to a comember or covillager and asking the other half to allocate first to a comember or covillager and then to a stranger. The order in which the choice was made does not influence the results. 25 See Baldassarri and Grossman ð2013Þ for further details on this aspect. <ref type="bibr" coords="24,65.25,567.77,6.00,4.58">26</ref> While there are previous instances of lab-in-the-field DGs, to my knowledge this is the first research in which a PGG has been performed in the field. participants. In each producer organization, group members were randomly assigned to one of three variants of the PGG. In the baseline condition, subjects participated in six rounds of a PGG without punishment or communication. In the second condition, after two preliminary rounds of play, one of the participants was elected to become a monitor endowed with sanctioning power. Namely, monitors were able to spend 1 MU to take away 3 MUs from subjects whose contribution level they disapproved. <ref type="bibr" coords="25,360.90,443.67,5.95,4.58">27</ref> In the third condition, after two preliminary rounds of play, players were allowed to publicly discuss their strategy for three minutes.

According to our research design, we would expect no differences between variants in the first two preliminary rounds. This is the case for the baseline and communication variants in which subjects contributed between 45% and 50% of their endowment. Unfortunately, as a result of an interviewer effect, subjects in the monitor condition contributed between 5% and 8% more in the two preliminary rounds, and this difference is marginally significant. <ref type="bibr" coords="26,99.66,491.18,6.01,4.58">28</ref> To control for this aspect, I rely on results from multilevel models that control, among the other things, for the interviewers and the contribution in the preliminary rounds.

In contrast, when participants were allowed to communicate, there is a visible increase in contributions: on average, the contribution in the communication condition is 1.91 MUs higher ðP &lt; .001Þ than in the baseline condition. Repeated interaction supported by communication is therefore effective in triggering mechanisms of reciprocity and increases the overall level of cooperation. Although less effective, the threat of punishment leads to similar results. Subjects in the sanctioning condition tend to give, on average, 1.55 MUs more than subjects in the baseline condition ðP &lt; .001Þ.</p><p>Overall, I conclude that various mechanisms could be the basis of farmer group members' prosocial behavior and cooperative capacity. As in many other studies, I have found that subjects display altruistic behavior toward strangers. I also found that giving to a member of one's farmer organization leads to significantly greater donations, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of group solidarity. Moreover, in iterated strategic interactions, the threat of sanctioning increases the likelihood of cooperation. Finally, communication between participants is sufficient to elicit mechanisms of reciprocity, even in the absence of binding agreements, or the threat of sanctioning.</p><p>According to my research design, BGs are deployed in order to elicit mechanisms that are at work in real life and, specifically, the mechanisms that are responsible for inducing greater cooperation in the producer organization. It is now time to ask to what extent, if any, behavior in the experimental setting maps into our subjects' behavior in real life. Are more altruistic farmers or those who show greater attachment to the group also more likely to cooperate? Or instead do mechanisms of reciprocity and sanctioning lead to greater cooperation among farmer producers?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperation in the Lab and in Real Life</head><p>The last step in the analysis connects prosocial behavior in the experimental setting to levels of cooperation in the farmer group. The assumption driving this analysis is that whenever we find a correlation between behavior in the BGs and behavior in the farmer group, we can reasonably infer that the mechanisms that were isolated in the experimental setting might be at the basis of real-world outcomes ðPoteete et al. 2010Þ. <ref type="figure" coords="27,64.97,564.48,36.92,8.58" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> presents results from multilevel logistic regression models in which the two measures of collective outcome introduced before, namely, report these results in tabular form.

Since subjects were assigned to different variants of the BGs, it is necessary to compute separate models for each variant. For instance, the left plot of panel A reports the percentage change in the probability of selling in bulk as a function of a 1 MU change in the contribution to a stranger, to a comember, or to a covillager and average contribution ðin rounds 3-6Þ in the baseline condition of the PGG game. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,360.90,167.29,6.01,4.58">29</ref> The center plot shows the same analysis for those subjects that were assigned to the communication condition in the PGG, and the right plot reports results for those assigned to the sanctioning condition. Tables A3 and A4 in the appendix report results for these models in tabular form. Findings suggest that neither generalized altruism, as measured by the contribution to a stranger, nor group solidarity, as measured by the contribution to a member of the producer organization ðor villageÞ, is a good predictor of whether group members will sell in bulk. In contrast, subjects' reciprocity in an experimental setting is predictive of their behavior in the farmer group. In particular, those subjects who were more likely to cooperate in the PGG with communication were also more likely to sell via their farmer group: a 1 MU increase in contribution in the communication variant of the PGG corresponds to a 3.5% increase in the likelihood of selling via the farmer group ðP 5 .024Þ. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,221.67,335.33,6.01,4.58">30</ref> The corresponding figure for the baseline variant of the PGG is 21.7% ðP 5 .161Þ and for the sanctioning variant is 2.5% ðP 5 .174Þ. The last two, however, do not meet minimal criteria for statistical significance.</p><p>A similar pattern can be observed with respect to the likelihood of attending the general assembly ðfig. 5, panel BÞ. The only mechanism that is significantly correlated with participation in the life of the farmer organization is reciprocity: individuals who were more cooperative in the PGG with communication were also more likely to have attended the group meeting. A 1 MU increase in the contribution in the communication variant of the PGG corresponds to a 1.9% increase in the probability of attending the 29 I have collapsed the two variants of the DG in this analysis in order to have a larger sample size and improve the quality of the estimates.

Moreover, no sociodemographic predictor, when controlling for the level of contribution in behavioral games, is consistently significant ðsee app. tables A3 and A4Þ. In a model that includes only sociodemographic predictors, namely, gender, age, education, religiosity, and wealth, the latter is the only significant predictor of selling in bulk, and its estimated effect is smaller than the one reported for the contribution in the PGG with communication: a unit change in the standardized measure of wealth corresponds to a 3.3% increase in the likelihood of selling via the farmer group ðP 5 .025Þ. general assembly ðP 5 .086Þ.

Although results from this part of the analysis cannot be considered conclusive because of the sample size ðthe number of observations ranges from 197 to 370, depending on the modelÞ, similar analyses conducted on a representative sample of regular members ðwho are not members of the DC councilÞ confirm that levels of generalized altruism and group solidarity are not related to cooperation in the farmer group. 31 While among regular farmers sanctioning and the legitimacy of the group leadership are positively related to levels of cooperation ðGrossman and Baldassarri 2012Þ, 32 among members of the DC council, verbal communication turns out as the most viable solution to collective action dilemmas.

Considering both the motives actors have for cooperation and the beliefs they hold about others' behavior, I have identified four general mechanisms-generalized altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity based on verbal commitment, and the threat of sanctioningand proceeded to test their effectiveness using behavioral games.</p><p>Namely, I took behavioral games out of the aseptic walls of the laboratory and brought them to the field. By adopting an innovative methodological framework that combines behavioral games, network data, and survey interviews with members of Ugandan producer organizations, I was able to isolate the mechanisms that make group members cooperate in real life. This research design fulfills sociology's important aspiration, recently revived under the label of analytical sociology, to move beyond the simple assessment of correlations to investigate the mechanisms that bring about important social phenomena ðMerton 1957; <ref type="bibr" coords="31,298.54,240.48,68.20,8.58" target="#b45">Gambetta 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="31,54.99,252.50,68.59,8.58" target="#b62">Hedström 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="31,127.38,252.50,130.88,8.58">Hedström and Bearman 2009Þ</ref>.

The payoff, I believe, is substantial.</p><p>Through a novel adaptation of the DG and PGG in which members of the farmer organizations were randomly assigned to different game variants, I was able to demonstrate that, in our population of interest, group attachment leads to levels of solidarity toward members of the group that are substantially higher than general levels of altruism toward strangers and toward nonmembers and that both mechanisms of reciprocity and the threat of sanctioning lead to greater public goods provision. This experimental component allows us to decouple these different mechanisms and to draw causal conclusions about their effects in the population of interest.</p><p>The value added of carrying out behavioral experiments in a field setting is the capacity to relate behavior observed in the "real" setting to the mechanisms captured in the controlled experimental setting. In this analytical framework, the lab-in-the-field experiment is therefore used as a "petri dish" in order to isolate the mechanisms that are likely to be at work in real life. In particular, the experimental design makes it possible to conclude that the relationship between BGs and real-life behavior is not due to unobserved heterogeneity. Since, within each producer organization, participants have been randomized to different BGs variants, we can exclude that the relationship between BGs and real-life behavior is spurious and is brought about by some unobserved factors. However, we cannot exclude that some other, independent mechanisms is also to work.</p><p>In the context of producer organizations, other-regarding preferences, in the form of either generalized altruism or group solidarity, do not seem to be the motivations that trigger cooperation among local farmers. Rather, reciprocity emerging through communication is the mechanism most strongly related to cooperation in the producer organization. I conclude from this that sustained interaction and verbal commitment are therefore sufficient conditions, in this context, for making cooperation convenient and discouraging free riding. Finally, among the farmer representatives object of this study, the threat of sanctioning, although effective in an experimental setting, does not appear to be the mechanism at the basis of cooperation in real life. <ref type="bibr" coords="32,371.22,131.29,6.01,4.58">33</ref> Given the economic nature of these producer organizations, the finding that cooperation is likely to emerge from strategic considerations, rather than altruistic motivations, may not be particularly surprising. However, as suggested in the discussion of the scope conditions of the various collective action theories, I do expect a similar research design to lead to different conclusions if we were to consider other types of groups facing collective action problems. For instance, in the context of political mobilization or highrisk activism, I expect that prosocial motivations, and group solidarity in particular, would play a more important role; in the context of large groups, with sparse networks and rare social interactions, I expect the threat of sanctioning to be more effective than reciprocity. In sum, this approach can be applied to different instances of public goods provision, thus allowing for an assessment of the scope conditions of our theories of collective action and social capital.</p><p>A systematic comparison of the different mechanisms that bring about cooperation should benefit the literature on collective action, which has developed a rich emporium of such mechanisms but has not yet developed a systematic way to assess between them empirically. Greater focus on the motivations and strategic considerations that favor cooperation among interconnected actors will also greatly advance the literature on social capital. The latter, in fact, often relies on the general assumption that social networks and associational life have a positive impact on individual and group outcomes but rarely goes beyond the use of attitudinal measures of trust or selfreported measures of social relations and rarely makes any serious attempt at documenting the specific mechanisms through which social relations bring about trusting and cooperative behavior. This, however, is of utmost importance in fields such as economic development, in which social capital scholarship can inform policy interventions and therefore has the potential of affecting the life outcomes of individuals and their communities. While for academic scholarship observing a relationship between networks and outcomes might suffice, to devise effective social interventions, it is important to know the motivations, strategies, and incentives that affect the behavior of interconnected actors in specific settings.</p><p>Finally, social network research could find an important ally in behavioral games to advance its research agenda, moving beyond demonstrations that network position and overall network structure "matter" to better assess the motivations, patterns of strategic interaction, and group dynamics that inform individual and group behavior. While in the research here presented network data have been used exclusively to show the existence of a positive relationship between network position and cooperation, preexistent social relations can be incorporated in lab-in-the-field research designs, thus systematically subjecting network measures of interest to experimental variation. Along with the study of network evolution, which in certain cases may be unfeasible, network-based lab-in-the-field experiments can facilitate the causal assessment of network effects in specific social settings.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">A social dilemma is "a situation in which actions that are individually rational can lead to outcomes that are collectively irrational" ðHeckathorn 1996, p. 250Þ. 3 Moreover, they should also be conceived as orientations that develop as a consequence of group membership, repeated interaction, etc., instead of being conceived as enduring qualities of the person.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9">APEP was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and implemented by Chemonics, a Washington, D.C., consultancy. 10 While village-level POs had neither the organizational capacity nor the volume to become significant economic entities, DCs were better positioned to exploit economies of scale. 11 This DC council meets two to four times a year and is responsible for connecting village-level POs to the DC. It is also responsible for providing oversight and monitoring of the DC manager, the most important officeholder, whose responsibilities range from overseeing all wholesale marketing activities to negotiating prices, coordinating the diffusion of information, and organizing training sections. Village-level POs are implementing bodies, mainly responsible for carrying out decisions made at the DC level, passing information from and to the farmers, and training them.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">In contrast, when selling their crop through the farmer organization, farmers entrust their produce to the manager and usually have to wait a few weeks before receiving their payment.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="13">The reason is that the price offered by middlemen depends on the price that the farmer group secures ð"yardstick effect"Þ, which itself crucially depends on volume. Some groups manage to overcome this tension between private and group interests, while many others fail. 14 A detailed description of the sampling scheme can be found in the online appendix, along with additional information in the research implementation.15  Only 1,097 of the subjects interviewed participated in the BGs. This gap arises because the experiments were conducted, in each DC, on a single day in a central location; to reduce attrition, interviewers returned to villages several times to locate members who were not present during the main day of data collection.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="33">Since, within each farmer cooperative, participants have been randomized to different variants of the treatment, we can exclude that the relation between BG and real-life behavior is spurious and is brought about by some unobserved factors. However, we cannot exclude that some alternative mechanism exists.</note>
