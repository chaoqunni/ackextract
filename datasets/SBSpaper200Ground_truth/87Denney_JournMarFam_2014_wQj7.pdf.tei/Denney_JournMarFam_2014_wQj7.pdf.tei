<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE COMBINED INFLUENCE OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION: POTENTIAL MECHANISMS</head><p>Households broadly represent an individual's immediate social environment, the daily arena for social support and integration. Households can include spouses, friends, children, other relatives, and even hired caretakers; in this article, the terms household, family, and living arrangements are used interchangeably. The theoretical work connecting how core elements of household living arrangements, employment, and education-such as social support and integration-influence suicide suggests they may combine in unique ways. Households and employment may combine through a process of compensation, meaning that positive attributes from one factor override negative attributes from the other. Households and education also may combine through a process of reinforcement, meaning that positive attributes on both factors work together to further reduce mortality risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independence: Important but Separate</head><p>First, the effects of social support and integration garnered both in the home and through work and education might be distinct enough to create important but separate effects on suicide.

Households and the relationships built within them provide systems of support unmatched in nearly any other area of life <ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.60,622.89,52.29,8.89;2,49.03,633.85,50.13,8.89" target="#b1">(Berkman &amp; Glass, 2000)</ref>. And employment and education provide economic stability, self-fulfillment, and improved social relations that correspond with reduced risks of taking one's own life <ref type="bibr" coords="2,420.76,74.82,27.94,8.89;2,257.84,85.79,22.35,8.89" target="#b48">(Stack, 2000a</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,287.18,85.79,21.93,8.89" target="#b49">(Stack, , 2000b</ref>. Many of the explanations for the associations among employment, education, and suicide are similar. Employment increases income and decreases economic hardship. Economic hardship can erode mental and physical health. Indeed, the accumulation of stress from trying to meet the basic needs of a household not only correlates with the odds of getting a disease but also with failing to recover from it. In addition, involuntary nonemployment (as opposed to voluntary nonemployment because one is in school or retired) comes with a low sense of social control and low levels of social support <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.84,239.34,190.87,8.89;2,257.84,250.31,22.69,8.89" target="#b36">(Pearlin, Lieberman, Menaghan, &amp; Mullan, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,282.08,250.31,96.67,8.89" target="#b42">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 1995)</ref>.

Perhaps most important for suicide mortality, social relationships increase an individual's level of integration by creating a collective identity through important social bonds to others, what <ref type="bibr" coords="3,99.43,217.30,65.93,8.89">Durkheim (1897</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,169.84,217.30,17.91,8.89" target="#b10">Durkheim ( /1951</ref> referred to as social integration.

For most people, work goes a long way toward creating an identity and maintaining a script for navigating everyday life.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement: Synergistic Reduction of Risk</head><p>Although employment and education are both positively related to better health and improved overall mortality, there are reasons to believe that household formation and health-protecting resources from educational attainment <ref type="bibr" coords="3,289.53,96.75,104.97,8.89" target="#b31">(Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003)</ref> may reinforce each other in their combined impact on suicide. Over the last several decades, more similarly educated persons have been increasingly establishing intimate relationships and starting families with other, similarly educated individuals <ref type="bibr" coords="3,293.26,162.52,138.03,8.89;3,244.85,173.48,52.95,8.89" target="#b29">(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &amp; Brashears, 2006)</ref>. For example, college graduates are increasingly likely to marry other college graduates, and persons with low levels of education are increasingly more likely to marry other persons with low education <ref type="bibr" coords="3,358.26,217.32,77.45,8.89;3,244.85,228.28,21.71,8.89" target="#b44">(Schwartz &amp; Mare, 2005)</ref>.This could result in greater material and social resources that can reduce suicide risks for highly educated individuals in relationships; that is, two positive states together may be better than the sum of the two separately.

Although contemporary research has shown that more education is positive in many respects for individuals <ref type="bibr" coords="3,350.24,403.66,85.48,8.89;3,244.85,414.62,21.44,8.89" target="#b31">(Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003)</ref>, some classic works have posited that educational attainment reflects increasing individualism and a consequent disconnect from social life. This premise suggests that the direct effects of employment and education on suicide may not be the same and runs counter to the prevailing idea that increased mortality risk is linked to disadvantage (i.e., lower education). Studies of the association between education and suicide at the individual level are quite limited <ref type="bibr" coords="3,244.85,524.23,57.18,8.89" target="#b48">(Stack, 2000a)</ref>, but some recent work has suggested that educational attainment is negatively associated with suicide, at least for men <ref type="bibr" coords="3,401.40,546.15,34.30,8.89;3,244.85,557.12,45.78,8.89" target="#b9">(Denney et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In the United States and other developed nations, people with more education live longer and healthier lives <ref type="bibr" coords="3,369.33,589.99,66.38,8.89;3,244.85,600.96,21.44,8.89" target="#b41">(Rogers et al., 2000)</ref>. They are also more likely to marry, stay married, have children, and maintain more harmonious and uninterrupted family lives-all independent contributors to better health and reduced suicide risk. But this suggests that relationships between education and suicide are not entirely independent of domestic support systems. Benefits from more education could in some ways rely on or be enhanced by household support. If so, both family support and educational attainment together exert special positive effects on suicide. This leads to a hypothesis specific to educational attainment that runs counter to the predicted combined relationship of work status and household formation on suicide risk.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Living in a family household, either with a spouse or with children, is associated with a greater reduction in suicide risk for adults with more education than for those with less education.</p></div>

However, the same study showed that higher educational attainment lowered risk among men but that education was unrelated to women's risk.

Thus, men who do not work may rely more heavily on sources of support in the household. And men who pursue individual achievement through higher education may mitigate any social support and integration deficits through the household. Meanwhile, families, work status, and education may independently influence women's risk. No work to date has examined the combined influence of family formation with work status and education on suicide mortality risk by gender.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>The data for this study came from a combination of multiple years of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), linked to prospective mortality through the Linked Mortality Files (LMF). The Integrated Health Interview Series, an initiative through the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota, streamlines an otherwise arduous data construction process and provides the complete data set used here <ref type="bibr" coords="5,36.04,205.55,157.26,8.89">(Minnesota Population Center, 2010)</ref>. NHIS years include 1986 through 2004, and LMF covers 1986 through 2006. Designed as a crosssectional household survey, the NHIS annually collects information from approximately 30,000 to 40,000 households, obtaining response rates consistently at or above 90% (National Center for Health Statistics <ref type="bibr" coords="5,117.66,282.42,56.60,8.89">[NCHS], 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,178.86,282.42,18.41,8.89">[NCHS], -2004</ref>.</p><p>The NCHS recently completed its fourth mortality follow-up with NHIS respondents <ref type="bibr" coords="5,194.52,304.38,32.38,8.89;5,36.04,315.36,21.44,8.89">(NCHS, 2009)</ref>. To create the LMF, the NCHS uses a probabilistic mortality matching scheme that assigns weights to multiple factors, including social security number, first and last name, and date of birth. It is important to note that, because of confidentiality concerns, public-use mortality data include deaths only for persons over age 17. Accordingly, data from respondents under age 18, who comprised 28% of the original sample and 6% of all suicides in 2009 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,183.20,414.19,43.68,8.89;5,36.04,425.17,47.35,8.89" target="#b22">(Kochanek et al., 2011)</ref>, were included in the construction of household variables (described below) and were subsequently dropped.</p><p>An additional 3% of cases were dropped because they were missing data on the key variables used in the empirical analyses or because the NCHS designated them as ineligible to be linked to prospective mortality; ineligible cases are those whose records include insufficient identifying data, such as name and social security number, to create a mortality record <ref type="bibr" coords="5,194.52,534.97,32.38,8.89;5,36.04,545.95,21.43,8.89">(NCHS, 2009)</ref>. For the years used here, fewer than 3% of cases are deemed ineligible in any single year, and NCHS (2009) provided weights that adjust for the exclusion of ineligible records. Finally, because of mortality selection at the oldest ages and because most adults complete their education and enter the workforce by early adulthood, the final data set included information on 935,802 adults ages 25 to 65 residing within 564,594 households. The individual records are linked to 1,238 suicide deaths through 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The dependent variable, suicide mortality, was coded 1 for suicidal death, defined in the World Health Organization's (2007) 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death as "death from intentional self-harm" (codes X60-X84); it was coded 0 for all other respondents, who either survived the follow-up or died from other causes.</p><p>The NHIS collects a core set of sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and health measures; however, the amount of detail sometimes varies from year to year. To maintain consistency across all years, this study used some more broadly defined variables. Age was a continuous variable, and gender was coded dichotomously with women as the referent, and multivariate analyses stratified models separately for men and women. Race was also a dichotomous variable, with non-Hispanic White as the referent.</p><p>Separate dummy variables captured educational attainment and work status, with referents of greater than high school and employed, respectively. Only some years of the NHIS contain more detailed measures of education <ref type="bibr" coords="5,244.85,362.27,54.19,8.89">(NCHS, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,303.64,362.27,18.41,8.89">(NCHS, -2004</ref>, so the less detailed measure was used to allow investigation over the entire study period. Although not ideal, the education dummy variable captures important differences in status. Work status separates employed individuals from those who reported that they were unemployed or not in the labor force. Compared to work and education, income has less influence on suicide mortality <ref type="bibr" coords="5,412.50,449.24,18.58,8.89;5,244.85,460.10,67.72,8.89" target="#b9">(Denney et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,316.36,460.10,90.97,8.89" target="#b25">Kposowa et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,411.11,460.10,24.62,8.89;5,244.85,470.97,25.84,8.89" target="#b48">Stack, 2000a)</ref>. Thus, income was included primarily as a control measure. A continuous measure of income was approximated by taking the midpoint of the categories defined by the NCHS and by estimating a median value for the openended category <ref type="bibr" coords="5,308.83,525.32,104.15,8.89" target="#b35">(Parker &amp; Fenwick, 1983)</ref>. The value was then adjusted to account for varying purchasing power among families of differing sizes (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,287.34,557.94,144.08,8.89" target="#b53">Van der Gaag &amp; Smolensky, 1982)</ref>, and the consumer price index was used to regulate changes in purchasing power over time.</p><p>Missing data for income were estimated using a number of covariates, and stochastic variation was incorporated into the predicted values of income to better represent variability in the actual income data (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,343.25,634.03,88.20,8.89" target="#b12">Gelman &amp; Hill, 2007)</ref>. A logged transformation of the continuous measure was included in the multivariate models to account for its skewed distribution; models were estimated with and without the missing income data, and no discernible differences appeared.</p><p>The NHIS person files include no measures on mental health, but research suggests that subjective reports of health encapsulate many dimensions of overall health, and they vary in important ways across gender and socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" coords="6,100.75,162.52,139.13,8.89" target="#b21">(Idler, Hudson, &amp; Leventhal, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,49.03,173.48,69.25,8.89" target="#b43">Schnittker, 2005)</ref>. Thus, self-rated health was included in models as a broad indicator of current health; it was measured continuously on a scale that ranged from 0 (poor health) to 4 (excellent health). Controlling for health status also helps with issues of selection; poor health at baseline may have an influence on family type and economic resources, increasing suicide risk.</p><p>To take advantage of the household nature of the NHIS data, multiple variables-including marital status and household size-are used to identify household types. Each household in the NHIS is assigned a unique numeric identifier, as is each person; in combination, these numbers enable the analyst to ascertain who lives in which household. Then, a series of steps identifies the configuration of the household. First, a variable identifies households that include children under age 18. Second, a variable indicates whether a marriage exists within the household. A third variable records whether households include other nonchild relatives, and a fourth indicates whether unrelated persons reside in the dwelling. Because suicide is a relatively rare cause of death, the types of households included in the analyses are limited to those that capture critical aspects of domestic integration. Marriedcouple families without children, marriedcouple families with children under age 18, unmarried families with children under age 18, and unmarried families without children are included. Unmarried families include adults who are not currently married but may have been divorced or widowed as well as those who never married. Family types with and without children can include other nonchild relatives and unrelated adults. Separate analyses of the more intricate family types do not alter interpretations. For example, separating married-couple-only households from marriedcouple households with other relatives or unrelated persons produces much the same results. Some household configurations are more common than others, but all household configurations used in the present analysis represent the living situation of at least 4.0% of the sample. The reference category in all multivariate analyses is an adult living alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation</head><p>Multivariate analyses investigating the relationships among individual characteristics, household living arrangements, and suicide employ a Cox proportional hazard framework <ref type="bibr" coords="6,413.59,172.71,35.14,8.89;6,257.84,183.64,21.44,8.89" target="#b0">(Allison, 1984)</ref>.

To evaluate effects across groups, interaction models were estimated, and Wald tests were calculated using the results from those models, a procedure referred to as the generalized linear model solution to compare model results <ref type="bibr" coords="6,407.12,655.77,41.58,8.89;7,36.04,74.82,21.44,8.89" target="#b18">(Hoffman, 2004)</ref>. The Wald test is distributed chi-square and provides the analyst with some important flexibility, including the ability to evaluate differences across all household types and differences across specific types of household configuration. Degrees of freedom are equal to the total number of household types for the former (4) and equal to 1 for the latter.</p><p>The multivariate analyses proceeded by first establishing the relationship between household living arrangement and suicide for the full sample and separately by gender (see <ref type="table" coords="7,188.11,195.38,31.61,8.89" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Then, models were estimated to assess the effects of household living arrangement by work status and educational attainment on suicide risk (see <ref type="table" coords="7,55.50,239.22,29.72,8.89" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). The Wald test information from these models represent tests of two-way interactions (i.e., living arrangement √ó work status). Finally, models with three-way interactions (i.e., living arrangement √ó education √ó gender) were estimated to further delineate household living arrangement by work status and educational achievement for men and women. The three-way interaction models also included all one-way (i.e., education) and two-way terms (i.e., living arrangement √ó education). The Wald test information for significant three-way interaction models is presented in <ref type="table" coords="7,149.64,370.74,29.77,8.89" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. The Wald test information provided in <ref type="table" coords="7,160.60,381.70,66.32,8.89" target="#tab_2">Tables 3 and 4</ref> was used to assess the proposed processes of combined influence. If a process of compensation occurs, supportive household formations will reduce suicide risk more for individuals with fewer resources (i.e., those who are not working). If reinforcement occurs, the opposite will be observed: Persons with more resources will benefit more from supportive household types (i.e., those that are more highly educated). Finally, if living arrangements, work status, and educational attainment exert independent effects on mortality risk, no significant differences across groups will be observed in the Wald tests.</p></div>

For the full sample, compared to a single adult living alone, living in households that included other members was associated with suicide risks less than 1.0. The key individual-level variables, work status and education, showed that not working was associated with a 65% higher risk of suicide over the follow-up period, but having less education, compared to having more, was not significantly associated with suicide risk. Other individual-level controls in the full model showed that men were at over four times the risk of suicide compared to women, non-Whites experienced 60% the risk of Whites, income had no effect, and more positive health ratings were associated with lower suicide risks.</p><p>The models by gender in <ref type="table" coords="8,167.74,315.95,31.39,8.89" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> generally show that the risk of suicide was lower for respondents living in households with other adults and children compared to living alone. Men in unmarried households without children had a lower risk of suicide than men who lived alone, but the same comparison among women showed that unmarried women who live with others face similar risks of suicide compared to women who live alone. The difference between men and women in that household type was marginally significant (p = .08; results available on request). Men and women who were not working were more likely to commit suicide over the follow-up period compared to their working counterparts. But although men with less education showed a higher risk of suicide than more highly educated men, the education association was reversed among women (and significantly different from men, p ‚â§ .05; results available on request).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>As a leader of premature mortality in the United States over the last 50 years, suicide has aroused continued concern from policymakers, researchers, and public health officials alike. Indeed, the seemingly individual act of suicide possesses a social character. Sources of social support and integration, including those found in the home, at work, and through educational attainment, have documented relationships with health. Results on 20 years of U.S. data linked to prospective mortality suggest that household support systems and individual employment and education are important contributors of suicide risk and that they also combine in unique ways to influence suicide. A process of compensation was revealed, suggesting that adults who are not working may rely more heavily on households that include other adults and children to lower risks of suicide. The combination of education and household formation, however, revealed a process of reinforcement, suggesting that more educated adults may experience more protection from the household than do less educated adults. Support through household relationships and responsibilities may be an essential consideration of suicide risk for adults who are out of the labor force: It could serve as a last line of protection against the potential loss of meaning and social ties through work. This protection may be particularly salient for people in households that include children. Marriage and family life, especially the rearing of children, may replace the structure and meaning that persons typically rely on employment to provide. Family life may also encourage the avoidance of risky behavior associated with criminal activity and substance abuse (especially for men) that place people at increased risk for a number of poor health and mortality outcomes. This process of compensation follows the logic and findings of the relationships between disadvantage and health. Social support and greater resources are better for long-term health and mortality prospects. It is reasonable to deduce that a deficiency in one area may lead a person to depend more heavily on another. Doing so explicitly recognizes the importance of considering both employment status and family type in tandem rather than separately.</p><p>Perhaps more elusive, from a disadvantage perspective, is an explanation of why more educated persons might experience more protection via support from the home than less educated persons. Whereas the interaction between work status and household living arrangement appeared strongest in households that included children, the interactive relationship between living arrangement and education was exemplified in households where a marriage was present. Both classical sociological theory and contemporary research on the benefits of educational attainment provide places to begin to understand this finding. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,88.73,458.46,66.56,8.89">Durkheim (1897</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,159.76,458.46,17.90,8.89" target="#b10">Durkheim ( /1951</ref> contended that education may be accompanied by a general loss of social connectedness, making domestic relationships all the more essential for more educated individuals. More contemporary works suggest not only that education is itself a powerful resource but also that the benefits of marriage are greater, for example, for more highly educated persons because, over time, educational heterogeneity has declined such that more highly educated persons tend to marry and stay married to other highly educated persons <ref type="bibr" coords="11,178.22,579.03,48.68,8.89;11,36.04,589.99,45.49,8.89" target="#b29">(McPherson et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,83.27,589.99,94.94,8.89" target="#b44">Schwartz &amp; Mare, 2005)</ref>. This might result in greater material and social resources that are leveraged toward better health and improved longevity for highly educated individuals in relationships. In turn, those who are less educated benefit less from marriage because they typically are married to someone who also has low levels of education. The combined association of household composition and education may be more clearly related to men's risk, but the association between living in a married couple household with children and suicide varied by educational attainment for both men and women. Therefore, more educated men and women may synergistically experience the benefits that come with educational attainment and more resourceful marital relationships to reduce the risk of suicidal death.</p><p>Additional insights might be gained from age-specific models. Indeed, suicide research has identified middle-aged adults as a group with stability and comfort in personal and professional life <ref type="bibr" coords="11,311.95,239.23,56.84,8.89" target="#b49">(Stack, 2000b)</ref>, leading to high social integration, good jobs, and positions of power. Education, for example, can protect health, and it may exert special positive effects for adults who have maintained domestic and achieved economic stability in middle age. Variations in combined associations across the life course represent a fruitful area of future research with larger samples of adults living in various household types.</p><p>The NHIS LMF is large and nationally representative, but not without other limitations. The public-use release of mortality data limits the amount of information on the deceased; more detail at time of death would allow examination of respondents' changing status from interview to death. This may be relevant for the differences in the ways employment and education combine with living arrangement to influence mortality risk. Educational attainment is relatively stable over time, but employment status at the time of the interview is more likely to change by time of death, especially if the respondent encounters a medical issue that requires that he or she stop working or if the length of time between interview and death is long. Although the results presented here partially address these concerns by accounting for health status at time of interview and exploring shortened follow-up periods, these limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. Furthermore, the cross-sectionality of the NHIS limits the investigation of issues of selection. For example, measures of health before and after a change in work status might better capture relationships, because people who are not working are also likely in poorer mental health <ref type="bibr" coords="11,273.56,644.79,49.88,8.89" target="#b39">(Platt, 1984)</ref>. In addition, health status and other factors select adults into and out of certain living arrangements. Finally, core NHIS data do not include measures for other established predictors of mortality. Some of the more important considerations in the study of suicide specifically include religiosity <ref type="bibr" coords="12,205.86,118.52,34.03,8.89;12,49.03,129.44,98.73,8.89" target="#b11">(Ellison, Burr, &amp; McCall, 1997)</ref>, genetic propensities <ref type="bibr" coords="12,49.03,140.36,98.61,8.89" target="#b3">(Brent &amp; Mann, 2005)</ref>, and cultural norms relating to suicide acceptability <ref type="bibr" coords="12,189.78,151.28,50.13,8.89;12,49.03,162.21,64.05,8.89" target="#b7">(Cutright &amp; Fernquist, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Research on social contributors to health has shifted productively away from historical doctrines that first centered solely on structural and later on individual forces <ref type="bibr" coords="12,158.23,205.90,77.38,8.89" target="#b5">(Cockerham, 2007)</ref>. The findings presented here support an approach that explores explanations that lie somewhere in the middle ground, acknowledging that family and individual characteristics can combine to affect mortality in unique ways.
