<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Felids are important in the epidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii infection because they are the only hosts that can shed environmentally resistant oocysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009)</ref>. Although antibodies to T. gondii are widely prevalent in many species of felids, including the domestic cat, clinical toxoplasmosis is rare in wild felids <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jones and Dubey, 2010)</ref>. However, toxoplasmosis causes severe illness in Pallas cats (Felis manul), and the parasite can be transmitted transplacentally from asymptomatic mothers to kittens <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kenny et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Basso et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dubey, 2009)</ref>. Recently, a similar phenomenon was described for Sand cats (Felis margarita) from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pas and Dubey, 2008a)</ref>.</p><p>The Sand cat is a small-sized desert felid weighing 2-3 kg. It is found in sand and stone deserts ranging from the north of Africa to Asia, with the Arabian Peninsula as its centre of distribution. It is well adapted to living in arid areas and in areas where temperature changes are extreme with temperatures ranging from 0 to 58 • C. The Sand cat is mainly nocturnal, spending the days in a shallow burrow or under vegetation. Their prey consists of small rodents and occasional birds and reptiles. It may be able to exist without drinking free water <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Sausman, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Sand cats are held and bred in captivity at institutes worldwide. In captivity, Sand cats are fed a variety of diets from small whole chicks and rodents to commercially prepared feline diets. Some vegetables are added to the diets and water is kept available <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Sausman, 1997)</ref>. At the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW), the Sand cats are kept in large outside enclosures with an inner den. The enclosures are only accessed by the keepers and the breeding animals are not on display to the public. The cats are kept individually and only paired for part of the year to avoid having offspring during the extremely hot summer months.</p><p>We recently reported severe congenitally acquired toxoplasmosis in Sand cats at the BCEAW <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pas and Dubey, 2008a)</ref>. In the present paper we report additional cases of fatal toxoplasmosis in Sand cats in UAE and the State of Qatar, and genetically characterize T. gondii isolates from these cats for the first time from this host. We also document prevalence of T. gondii antibodies in several other species of animals from the UAE and Qatar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Samples from BCEAW</head><p>2.1.1. Sand cats with clinical toxoplasmosis <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref> 2.1.1.1. FM016 and FM017. On 2 March 2006 two kittens (FM016 and FM017) were born in captivity to a breeding pair that had given birth to another T. gondii infected litter the previous year <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pas and Dubey, 2008a)</ref>. The kittens were weighed and examined twice a week in an attempt to detect disease in the early stages. They were developing normally until day 26, when FM016 died of acute toxoplasmosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pas and Dubey, 2008a)</ref>. The surviving kitten, FM017, had a MAT titer of &gt;3200 and was medicated with clindamycin (Dalacin C TM , Pharmacia, Puurs, Belgium) for 15 weeks at a dosage of 20 mg/kg given orally with a syringe. Once the kitten started eating solid food the clindamycin powder was disguised in liquid fat on the food. The animal developed no clinical signs during this period but at the age of 1 year however, it was observed to walk into objects and a severe bilateral mydriasis was seen. Direct and indirect pupil reflexes were negative and ophthalmological examination revealed a partial degeneration of the retina. Blood samples excluded infections with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or Bartonella sp. Further differentials for retinal degeneration included taurine deficiency and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) but no further indications could support these etiologies. Over several months the animal showed an increasing muscle atrophy of the hind legs and became ataxic. A general examination under anesthesia did not reveal any obvious cause for the problems seen. Liver values AST and ALT were slightly increased as well as bile acids (AST 78.9 U/l, ALT 144.5 U/l, and bile acids 35.98 mol/l). The animal was treated several times with vitamin B complex (B.Complex-C, Bio-Pharmachemie Co. Ltd., Vietnam) and anabolica (Ilium Boldebal-H, Troy laboratories PTY Limited, Australia) injections and de-wormed regularly. At the age of 3 years, she became incontinent. Hematuria and high alkalinity was seen and many crystals were found in the urine sediment. After 2 weeks of treatment with marbofloxacine injected and later given orally at a dosage of 2 mg/kg (Marbocyl 2% and Marbocyl 20 mg tablets, Vetoquinol, B.V.'s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) there was no improvement and since the ataxia and general condition of the animal had already deteriorated for such a long time, the cat was euthanized. Samples of frozen liver and lungs were sent to the Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory (APDL), Beltsville, MD for further evaluation.</p><p>2.1.1.2. FM019 and FM020. On 12 March 2009 two new Sand cats, a 1-year-old male FM019 and a 2-year-old female FM020, were acquired from a nearby collection where they had been born in captivity. The animals were quarantined at the BCEAW for 6 weeks during which they were observed for signs of illness and examined once under anesthesia. Hematologic and biochemical evaluations were done at that time but no abnormal blood values were seen, and viral testing for FeLV and FIV (SensPERT kits, Combined FeLV Antigen/FIV antibody test, Vet All Laboratories, Korea) were negative. They were also seronegative for T. gondii antibodies (see serology section) on blood samples drawn on 4 April 2009. After their quarantine period, the animals were moved to a display enclosure in the zoo. In this enclosure Gordon's wildcats of which several had antibodies to T. gondii <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pas and Dubey, 2008b)</ref> had previously been housed. Shortly after it was noticed that the female FM020 was not eating well, but this was attributed to the rather low temperatures in the cage, which is regulated with air-conditioning. The animal received a general examination and blood was collected under sedation with medetomidine (0.05 mg/kg, Domitor, Orion Pharma, Finland). Liver enzymes ALT and AST were slightly increased (AST 110.2 U/l and ALT 144.2 U/l) as well as urea (19 mmol/l) but with a normal creatinine (60 mol/l). All other hematology and biochemistry val- ues tested were in normal range. No further abnormalities could be detected during examination and her weight was as expected. Radiographs of the thorax and abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities either. Apart from some subcutaneous fluid during the procedure, no other treatment was indicated and since it was thought that the low temperature might have been the reason for the inappetance, only environmental changes were made. This cat is now apparently healthy. A blood sample was obtained from cat FM020 on 15 July 2009 for T. gondii antibodies. Four weeks later her male cage mate FM019 looked depressed and ate less than normal. He was hand caught to perform an examination but during normal restraint and handling to take radiographs he developed a severe dyspnoea, collapsed and died on 15 June 2009. A necropsy was performed on the same day.</p><p>2.1.1.3. FM002. Cat FM002 was imported from the USA in 1998 at the age of 3 years. In 2006 a blood sample was taken and the T. gondii antibody titer was determined with a latex agglutination test at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, using a commercial kit (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan), which showed a positive titer of &gt;512. Testing for FIV, FeLV and FeCoV were negative at that time. In 2007 he started to show signs of ataxia in the hind legs and a slight head tilt. A full examination under sedation revealed no obvious abnormalities but hematology results revealed a severe increase in globulins (80 g/l) and proteinuria. Because of previous problems in the Sand cats with toxoplasmosis infection, the animal was started on clindamycin (Dalacin C TM , Pharmacia, Puurs, Belgium) at 20 mg/kg twice daily for 32 days. Clinical signs improved slowly but the animal never completely recovered and remained slightly ataxic. Behavioural changes indicated that he also might have had impaired vision and a full ophthalmological examination was performed which revealed an inactive chorioretinitis with partial degeneration of the retina.</p><p>In February 2010 the condition of this cat deteriorated quickly. He was anorexic, had diarrhoea and had severe difficulties walking. A full examination revealed a severely extended bladder without obstruction and general mus-  cle atrophy. A urine examination revealed proteinuria, but no bacterial growth. Blood samples revealed an increased urea (14.7 mmol/l) with a normal creatinine (95 mol/l). X-rays showed some consolidated areas in the frontal lung lobes, round shaped kidneys and a severe scoliosis of the thoracic vertebrae with bone demineralization. Because of the poor condition of the animal, and its old age, the cat was euthanized.</p></div>

This cat was born at AWWP, and had been vaccinated yearly with feline panleukopaenia virus, feline rhinotracheitis virus, feline calcivirus (Felocell CVR, Pfizer GmbH, Berlin, Germany), and rabies virus (Rabdomun, Essex Tierarznei, Muenchen, Germany) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Deb et al., 2009</ref>). On 11 January 2010 this cat was examined because of anorexia and weakness. Its mucous membranes were pale and it showed labored breathing. A blood sample was obtained for biochemical and hematological tests. The cat died after 3 days of treatment with subcutaneous injections of 16.8/4.2 mg/kg amoxicillin-clavulanacid (Synulox RTU 140/30 mg/ml, Pfizer GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and 0.6 mg/kg meloxicam (Metacam 5 mg/ml, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) and in addition 150 ml subcutaneous fluids (Electrolytloesung, Albrecht GmbH, Aulendorf, Germany). Initially formalin-fixed tissues were submitted to a commercial laboratory (Institut für Tierpathologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, 80539 Muenchen, Veterinaerstr. 13, Germany) for histological examination. After the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, formalin-fixed tissues and frozen liver and lung of the Sand cat 3657 were sent to the Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory (APDL), Beltsville, MD for further evaluation.</p></div>

Postmortem gross lesions were seen in the lungs which were edematous with multiple small white nodules in all lung lobes. Similar small white nodules were found in the pancreas and omentum. The mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged and a tapeworm was found in the small intestine. Histologically, there were multifocal area of necrosis and inflammation in adrenal glands, subacute interstitial pancreatitis, interstitial pneumonia, abdominal adipose tissue necrosis, hepatitis, and mild myocarditis. There was gastritis characterized by multifocal necrosis of glands, mixed cellular infiltration of the lamina propria, cellular debris within gland lumina. Many tachyzoites were seen in the lamina propria and in glandular epithelial cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Two loops of the colon showed mild enteritis associated with tachyzoites. Sections of small intestine and brain were not fixed for histology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In the present study, two Sand cats (FM019 and 3657) died of acute toxoplasmosis at separate establishments. Cat FM019, born in captivity at BCEAW, and appeared clinically normal until 18 months of age. Its MAT titer was 1:1600 at the time of death, but was seronegative to T. gondii 2 months before its demise.</p><p>Sand cat 3657 was also born in captivity at AWWP. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was confirmed immunohistochemically, by serology and by PCR. The acute nature of lesions indicated that toxoplasmosis was acquired recently, and only tachyzoites (not tissue cysts) were seen in lesions. In Sand cat 3657, lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes and stomach are noteworthy. The finding of gastritis was unusual as this is rarely seen in domestic cats (Felis domesticus) naturally infected with T. gondii <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009</ref>) and has not been reported in wild felids.</p><p>Why some animals develop clinical toxoplasmosis whereas most remain subclinical is unknown. Recently, attention has been focused on the genetic makeup of the strains in pathogenesis of clinical toxoplasmosis and atypical strains were found to cause clinical toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Demar et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">ElbezRubinstein et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Dubey, 2009</ref>). Currently there is no information on the genetic characterization of T. gondii isolates from the Middle East or the Sand cat. In the present study, the strain of T. gondii from UAE was found to be atypical. This genotype has been reported in dogs from Sri Lanka <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dubey et al., 2007)</ref>. The isolate from Qatar is a common Type II strain that is frequently identified worldwide.</p><p>The cause of ataxia and retinal degeneration in FM017 was not determined. The presence of numerous tissue cysts in the brain and few lesions might have contributed to illness. It is known that clindamycin acts on tachyzoites but has no effect on tissue cysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Prevention of T. gondii infection in zoo animals is a major problem, especially in highly susceptible species, such as Pallas and Sand cats, New World primates, and marsupials. Cats, like other hosts of T. gondii can become infected transplacentally, by ingesting food and water contaminated with oocysts, and by the ingestion of infected tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009)</ref>. In domestic cats the ingestion of infected tissues is more efficient because even a few bradyzoites are infectious for cats whereas few oocysts are not, and transplacental transmission is considered infrequent <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009</ref>). However, Pallas and Sand cats are different because unlike humans, domestic cats and sheep, chronically infected asymptomatic dams transmit infection to their offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The diet of all small carnivores at the BCEAW previously consisted of imported frozen buffalo and chicken meat, locally bought fresh camel and donkey meat, frozen day old chicks, and white mice and rats, pigeons, guinea fowl and quail that have been bred at the BCEAW. After the neonatal deaths in Sand cats in 2006 were confirmed as being caused by toxoplasmosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pas and Dubey, 2008a)</ref>, the Sand cat diet was adapted to include only meat that has been frozen at −20 • C for at least 1 week or fresh mice and rats bred at the BCEAW. Limited sampling of rats and mice sera fed to cats at BCEAW did not have any evidence of T. gondii infection. Although a serious effort is made to keep the enclosures pest free, wild rodents, birds and reptiles can still gain access and feral cats are sometimes found roaming within the BCEAW.</p><p>The diet of the Sand cats in Qatar consists of white mice and rats bred at AWWP. In addition they are fed with wild pigeons which have been caught and slaughtered on the premises and then frozen for different periods (ranging from 1 day to 1 month). Pest control programs are limiting the number of wild mice and rats in the area of the enclosures, but are not eradicating all.</p><p>Although no method can be regarded as 100% effective, most T. gondii tissue cysts will be destroyed when meat is frozen and thawed as well as by heating up to 67 • C or processing the meat (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dubey, 2009)</ref>. Heating or processing the meat is not considered as an option at the BCEAW for nutritional and behavioural enrichment reasons. Results of the present study indicate that several other species of animals at BCEAW were exposed to T. gondii. However, clinical toxoplasmosis at the BCEAW has been documented only in Sand cats <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pas and Dubey, 2008a</ref>, and present study), in a Blanford's fox <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dubey and Pas, 2008)</ref> and in a Sandfox <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Pas and Dubey, 2008c</ref>) and now in Sand cat at AWWP.</p><p>In the present study, T. gondii antibodies were found in several species of carnivores in addition to Sand cats, Sand foxes and Blanford's foxes previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dubey and Pas, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pas and Dubey, 2008c)</ref>. We are not aware of previous reports of serological prevalence in the long eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus), white tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda), Indian grey mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii), Hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) and the Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sobrino et al. (2008)</ref> reported T. gondii antibodies in 59.1% of 22 Egyptian mongoose (Herpestis ichneumon) from Spain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pas and Dubey (2008b)</ref> found MAT antibodies in 86.1% of 36 Gordon's wild cat from the BCEAW. In the present study, T. gondii antibodies were found in 5 of 5 Gordon's wild cat. Whether Sand cat, Gordon's wild cat, caracal, or leopard can excrete T. gondii oocysts is unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dubey, 2009)</ref>, whereas it is known that cheetahs can excrete T. gondii oocysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Marchiondo et al., 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Polomoshnov, 1979)</ref>. There are several Gordon's wild cats resident at the BCEAW. They were housed in the same pen 2 months before the Sand cats FM019 and FM020 were introduced in the enclosure. Oocysts excreted by these cats might have been present in the pen where the Sand cats were housed and could be the source of infection for Sand cats at BCEAW.</p><p>It is of interest to see that the T. gondii strain identified in Sand cats from UAE has an atypical genotype that is different from the clonal Type I, II and III strains. This genotype was previously reported in T. gondii isolates of dogs from Sri Lanka <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dubey et al., 2007)</ref>, indicating it is widely spread in Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. In addition, the strain identified from Sand cat from Qatar belongs to the Type II lineage that is also widely spread at the global scale. The high seropositivity of T. gondii in captive wild animals tested in this study, in addition with the lack of epidemiological studies on this parasite in the Persian Gulf region, makes it necessary to carry out further studies to investigate the diversity and transmission of T. gondii in animal and populations in the region.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figs. 1 - 4 .</head><label>14</label><figDesc>Figs. 1-4.
