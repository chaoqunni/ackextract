<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>On December 31 st 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, China <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>On January 11 th , 2020, the Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus from 41 cases and isolated the nucleic acid of the pathogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The South China Seafood Market in</p><p>Wuhan city was thought to be the source of the outbreak, which remains under investigation. Since then, the number of confirmed cases in China has rapidly increased, with the outbreak spreading to other countries. As of 5 th March 2020, a total of 89,253 confirmed cases of coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), including 3,246 deaths, have been reported in 79 countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>KCDC has officially established a risk assessment system since 2016 due to lessons learned from the 2015 Middle East</p><p>Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea. The initial format of the system was established using the overall structure of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) rapid risk assessment procedures, and updated and modified this based on the requirements of the institution. To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using the available information.</p><p>For the probability of certain public health events, risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC risk assessment was categorized into 5 levels ("very low," "low," "moderate," "high," and "very high"), and overall risk was determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.  The second risk assessment was conducted on January 16 th , 9 days after the first assessment. The main triggers of this risk assessment were official reports of imported cases in Thailand on January 13 th , and in Japan on January 16 th . There was no evidence of human to human transmission until this time and no additional case had been officially reported in China since January 3 rd . The overall risk was escalated to "moderate" due to the increased risk of importation ("low" to "high") and transmission ("low" to "moderate"). The risk of importation was estimated as "high" because of the imported cases identified in Thailand and Japan, indicating a possibility of under-reporting of cases due to the unknown nature of the virus. The risk of transmission was also escalated due to the report of 1 potential family cluster in Wuhan, and contact history with an unidentified pneumonia patient from Japan.</p><p>The impact was "low" as there had been only 1 fatal case who had underlying chronic conditions and the rest of the patients were in stable conditions. Additionally, evidence of recovery of patients in Japan and Thailand also influenced the estimation.</p><p>On January 11 th , the WHO confirmed that the pathogen was a novel coronavirus and a validated primer was distributed and diagnostic probe was made available from January 11 Beijing and Shenzhen also reported confirmed cases. The risk of spread was not changed ("moderate") as no secondary transmission was officially confirmed. The impact was escalated to "moderate" as there was growing concern over the risk of additional cases, and human to human transmission.</p><p>Overall, the risk was escalated to "high" accordingly.</p><p>Meanwhile, updated case definitions were shared with  This led to an increased impact on the risk estimation, and the overall risk was also increased to "very high" accordingly (Risk of importation: "very high," Risk of spread: "very high,"</p><p>Impact: "very high," overall risk: "very high)." After this risk assessment, the national crisis management level was escalated to the highest level, Level 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Risk assessment is one of the core functions of a national public health agency, and it has been conducted by many The elderly and those with underlying chronic illnesses are most susceptible to severe symptoms of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The risk of COVID-19 ranged from "low" to "very high" in the risk assessments, based on the likelihood of transmission and the impact on society. Given the available epidemiological and clinical characteristics, the Korean population was deemed to be susceptible, and as more information became available, it was evident that virus transmission was rapid, and had the potential to be a major public health issue in Korea.</p><p>The ROK risk assessment covered each phase of the outbreak, formats including social media, homepages, and press-releases.</p><p>The ECDC evaluated the situation based on the Chinese report, initially indicating a "low" likelihood of importation to Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The WHO indicated that the imported case in Thailand did not prove human-to-human transmission as further information was required <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Communication can use all available formats including social media, homepages, and press-releases. ECDC evaluations are escalated when the likelihood of importation to Europe is "low"</p><p>to "moderate," and likelihood of importation to neighboring Asian countries is "high," and human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The WHO's risk assessment showed that China's risk is "very high," while the risk of the Asia region is "high," and human-to-human transmission is occurring <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. to "moderate," and likelihood of importation to neighboring Asian countries as "high." Infection contracted in hospital was considered a "low" risk when appropriate infection prevention and control measures were in place <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The WHO evaluates risk in China as "very high" and the Asia region's risk as "high."</p><p>The WHO proposed that super-spread events may occur with human-to-human transmission among family members, and healthcare workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Risk Assessment 7 described a situation with distinct local outbreaks. There was sustained local transmission in Korea.</p><p>The objective was to mitigate the impact of the outbreak by decreasing general admissions to the hospitals and clinics to protect the general population from contracting the disease.</p><p>In this situation, communication should be conducted daily.</p><p>Messages should be balanced and focused on prevention and treatment. It also provides detailed routes of confirmed cases ECDC evaluations are escalated from likelihood of importation to Europe as "moderate" to "high," and the impact of the disease as "high," and human-to-human transmission may lead to widespread community transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The WHO assesses the situation that several countries show local humanto-human transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Risk Assessment 8 dealt with a situation with widespread sustained transmission in a Korean province (Daegu-Gyeongbuk Province) and distinct local outbreaks in other regions of Korea. The healthcare system was overburdened. ICU capacity was strained. The workers suffered from exhaustion, and staff numbers, PPE, and diagnostic testing capacity became insufficient. The objective was the same as Risk Assessment 7.</p><p>At this stage, the communication of risk was to ensure close collaboration of the general public with public health authorities, and healthcare providers is essential. Individual, religious, and societal concerns about death need to be considered.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. Firstly, the information in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak was preliminary and very limited, mainly since COVID-19 was a new emerging disease, and data from the Chinese government was the main source of information of this novel coronavirus.</p><p>Thus, we conducted several risk assessments with the ongoing available evidence, in a very short period of time as the situation evolved rapidly. Therefore, the estimation was very likely to be subjective in nature. Secondly, the risk assessment tool was not strictly applied to this novel pathogen as critical information was missing and had to be estimated with limited confirmed evidence. Thus, initial evaluation of this virus pathogenesis was likely to be subjective, and was the one of major factors that needed to be considered when conducting the risk assessment. Once more scientific evidence and knowledge becomes available after the end of this pandemic, overall review procedures and evaluation mechanisms need to be developed to improve and to minimize the limitations of the existing risk assessments by the Korea CDC.</p></div>

The risk assessment in Korea mainly aimed to provide information to enable evidence-based strategic response planning and relevant response measures for KCDC and the Ministry of Health and Welfare. It provided the risk assessment for COVID-19 at given dates, including the details on travel-associated imported cases, clusters outside Korea, risk for healthcare system capacity, options for preparedness and response, risk communication, social distancing, contact tracing and enhanced surveillance. Each risk assessment clearly influenced major decision making as the global situation was evolving, and the result was shared with the relevant ministries for their own planning and preparedness. COVID-19 is a new emerging pathogen. There is currently no vaccine nor therapeutic medication, and there is no existing immunity in the population. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from no symptoms, to severe pneumonia which can lead to death. COVID-19 can cause mild symptoms in about 80% of cases with most cases making a full recovery, while 14% have severe symptoms, and 6% experiencing critical conditions.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>with a total of 8 risk assessments conducted. The objective of the risk assessments was to activate national emergency responses and prepare for an epidemic to ensure containment and mitigation of COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical, public health measures. As for communication of the risks to the general public, knowledge and awareness of the disease must be ensured so that the population accept and engage in community-level and national public health measures. Communication of the risks also helps the preparation of protocols for laboratory-based testing development, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment. It also helps the public prepare for enhanced surveillance, epidemiological investigation, contact tracing, management of close contacts, case detection, and isolation. Communication of the risks also covers social distancing to deter further spreading by preventing public gatherings, and closure of schools and workplaces. It also covers prevention of nosocomial infection in healthcare facilities. Risk Assessment 1 and 2 are based on a situation with no reported cases in Korea and reporting of the disease outside Korea. The main public health measures are early detection of possible imported cases and isolation of the case to prevent further transmission in Korea. Communication of infection risks through the media provides information of the disease and upcoming public health measures, enabling public health authorities to lead community engagement for the forthcoming situation. The authorities can use all available</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>cases were observed in Korea. Imported cases have no sustained transmission. That is, only second- generation cases or transmission within a cluster, occurred in Korea. The public health measures focused on blocking transmission, with early detection of imported and locally transmitted cases, so that the health authority contained or delayed the transmission of the disease. Communication of risk at this stage is informative to the global situation, and the result of epidemiological investigations and public health measures. The key messages to the general public include prevention of infection and transmission, and preparation status of public health authorities. It also addresses multi-sectoral messages to relevant ministries/agencies and healthcare workers.</figDesc></figure>

of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with 

unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique 

and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk 

assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, 

transmission, and the impact at the country-level. The risk of 

importation and transmission were evaluated separately as 

COVID-19 was a newly identified pathogen where information 

about the coronavirus was limited. Predefined criteria triggered 

the KCDC risk assessment and enabled each risk assessment to 

be described in detail. 

Results 

Since the beginning of the current COVID-19 outbreak, 8 risk 

assessments have been conducted from January 8 
th to February 

19

Thus, the risk of importation as well as the risk of transmission was evaluated as "very high." The impact and the overall risk were "high." The</figDesc><table>The sixth risk assessment was conducted on January 

31 
st as the WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of 

International Concern on this day. The case count in China 

was 7,711 (1,370 severe cases, 170 deaths) and the spread of 

screening of travelers from abroad was expanded to include 

all travelers from China entering the ROK as of January 28 
th , 

and also case definition was updated to cover cases outside 

of Wuhan. In laboratory-based diagnosis, real time RT-PCR 

diagnosis was established in 18 provincial public health 

laboratories, and all test results became available within 6 

hours as of January 31 

st

The seventh risk assessment was conducted on February 

19

secondary cases accounted for the majority of the confirmed 

cases, but this trend gradually changed and cases without clear 

epidemiological links were reported since the identification 

of Case #29 on February 16 
th . On February 19 
th , a total of 15 

confirmed cases was reported, with 13 of these associated with a private religious group in Daegu province. Because of this 

cluster of cases, the risk of infection in this specific province 

was evaluated and it was estimated as "very high" and also the 

risk of transmission to other provinces was "high." All other 

nationwide risk assessment results remained the same (Risk of 

importation: "very high," Risk of spread: "very high," Impact: 

"high," overall risk: "high"). 

The last risk assessment was conducted on February 23 

rd 

because of an exponential number of confirmed cases. As of 

February 23 

rd 

, 556 confirmed cases were reported. Overall, the 

progress of the outbreak had significantly changed due to huge 

clusters in Daegu and Gyeongbuk areas. Out of 556 cases, 315 

(56%) were related to the private religious group, and 112 (20%) 

were linked with the Cheongdo Daenam hospital. Additionally,
