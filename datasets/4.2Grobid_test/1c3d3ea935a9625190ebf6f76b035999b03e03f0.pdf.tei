<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Influenza viruses A and B are the main pathogens responsible for the onset of epidemics because of their evolving nature. They are RNA viruses that have a high mutation rate and ability to make "drift" changes; however, only influenza A viruses are responsible for pandemics. Worldwide, influenza A viruses are the cause of severe infections in 3-5 million people annually, and these viral infections kills 0.25-0.5 million people annually. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">44</ref> As such, influenza outbreaks produce high morbidity and mortality rates with great economic and social impact. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">44</ref> Early findings in relation to the most recent influenza pandemic occurred in April 2009 in Mexico and soon spread to other countries. The pandemic was caused by an H1N1 variant, which came from two genetic recombination events. The first occurred in 1998, when an avian virus, an American pig virus, and virus fragments of humans had exchanged genetic materials. The following recombination with a European swine virus strain resulted in the pandemic swine origin influenza virus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">30</ref> In Mexico in recent years, this has caused at least four outbreaks with high mortality rates compared with that presenting in other countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> During the winter of 2017-2018, influenza activity increased in Mexico, and 2,855 cases of influenza and 73 deaths were confirmed by March 02, 2018, of which 46 cases were A(H3N2), 11 cases A(H1N1) pdm09, 10 cases B, and the remaining six cases were not subtyped. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">39</ref> Results emanating from different studies have shown that influenza outbreaks are characterized by high severity of symptoms with increased mortality, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">32</ref> Several factors have been associated with H1N1 disease severity, such as factors due to the virus (ie, viral pathogenic mutations, resistance to antivirals), factors inherent to host susceptibility (eg, age, sex, race), including physiological immunosuppression or acquired diseases (ie, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma), factors associated with available medical services and public health facilities, and factors arising from the presence of bacterial coinfections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">41</ref> Seasonal and pandemic influenza often have complications arising from bacterial coinfections. Cillóniz et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> documented that in H1N1 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (26, 62%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa <ref type="bibr">(6, 14%)</ref>. Staphylococcus aureus was rarely found, and Haemophilus influenzae was not found. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> During the 1918 pandemic, most deaths had bacterial coinfections. Globally, more than 34% of influenza virus infections needed intensive care among hospitalized patients, from which 0.5% of all cases of influenza corresponded to healthy young individuals and at least 2.5% of total cases the elderly group and those with coinfections harbored the bacteria. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> Symptoms of influenza cases with bacterial coinfections are similar to those with severe influenza, but the former may have a higher risk of death. Identification of coinfections should be considered in patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) presenting symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia, or with evidence of septicemia. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> Many copathogens are known to be colonizers of the respiratory mucosa, ie, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, including the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Distinction between copathogenic colonization and coinfection is critical, because a proven coinfection is clinically correlated with signs of pneumonia and bacterial contagion producing increased acuity or severity of disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>27</head><p>Empirical antiviral treatment should be considered and managed in such critically ill patients. The most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens are those that colonize the nasopharynx, and this complex of virus-bacteria contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease, mainly in periods of endemic influenza. <ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">34</ref> There have been studies reporting copathogens between influenza and other viruses, but few cases have observed that this produced severe complications because of coinfection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">42</ref> Two studies have hypothesized a "viral interference", suggesting that a rhinovirus infection may interfere with the A(H1N1pdm09) influenza, but this is still not fully understood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24,33</head><p>The precise identification of infectious pathogens responsible for acute respiratory infections, primarily influenza, is a critical factor for proper treatment of the disease and control during outbreaks and for the appropriate use of antibiotics and antivirals. For these reasons, continuation of investigations into the pathogens commonly associated with influenza cases is urgently needed. Here, the presence of bacterial and viral copathogens are identified using clinical samples for the molecular diagnosis by resequencing microarray in study patients with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Oaxaca, Mexico. We also document an association between influenza A(H1N1pdm 09) and symptoms of disease severity in dead patients with multiple-microbial infection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics statement</head><p>The present study involved the collaboration of one government health institution in Mexico that performed the sample collection. Before each examination, each adult who had voluntarily come to the examination point and agreed to participate was informed about the microbiological process of his/her sample, and oral consent was obtained. Parents or guardians provided oral consent on behalf of all under age child participants. The ethical committee of the health secretariat of Mexico approved the use of oral consent, given that the studies were conducted as part of the national H1N1-surveillance program and thus part of a routine public health-monitoring program conducted by the Mexican government.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-sectional survey</head><p>A total of 88 study patients with confirmed H1N1 by quantitative qRT-PCR from six health districts of Oaxaca in Mexico were examined for other microbial infections. These patients were recruited from April 2009 throughout December 2012. The present study meets the operational definition criteria for ILI cases recommended by the World Health Organization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">45</ref> Research and Reports in Tropical Medicine 2018:9 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com</p></div>

For patients &lt;5 years of age, irritability was substituted for headache. In those &gt;65 years of age, fever was not required as a cardinal symptom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical specimens from ILI patients with H1N1</head><p>Individual respiratory clinical samples were collected. These included throat swab, nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy according to each patient's condition. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using a rayon or Dacron hyssop in a plastic tube containing 2-3 mL viral transport medium. Bronchoalveolar wash and lung biopsy samples were collected by trained medical staff and placed in plastic bottles containing 15-20 mL viral transport medium. All samples were kept at 2°C-8°C after sampling and during transport to a local molecular biology laboratory and stored at -80°C until testing. Venlo, Netherlands). RNA extraction was completed using an automated protocol (QIAcube; Qiagen) and an elution volume of 60 μL. The RNA to be used as template was stored at -80°C until testing.</p></div>

RT-PCR cycling conditions were 25°C for 10 minutes, 50°C for 50 minutes, and 85°C for 5 minutes. The resulting product was stored at -20°C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiplex PCR amplification</head><p>With four 3.1 RPM-Flu 3.1 multiplex PCR tubes (A, B, C, and D), multiplex PCR amplification was conducted. The reaction mixture contained 5 μL cDNA, 11 μL Flexi buffer 5× GoTaq, 8.8 μL 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0.8 μL DNA polymerase GoTaq 5 UI/μL, and 0.4 μL UDG 0.22 KU/220 μL. PCR cycling conditions were initiated with two cycles of 24°C for 10 minutes and 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 16 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 45°C for 30 seconds (increasing 1°C every cycle until 60°C), and 72°C for 90 seconds. The reaction was ended using 24 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds and 60°C for 2 minutes. The PCR product was stored at 4°C.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fragmentation and labeling</head><p>Reagents were used for the fragmentation and labeling of the PCR products for the resequencing GeneChip assay (Affymetrix; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, in a PCR tube, fragmentation was conducted using 23 μL purified PCR products and 2.6 μL master mix (2.5 μL fragmentation buffer 10× and 0.1 μL fragmentation reagent). PCR cycling conditions were 37°C for 5 minutes and 95°C for 10 minutes. The PCR product was stored at 0°C. Subsequently, a new PCR tube was used to perform the DNA labeling, which contained 25.6 μL fragmented PCR products and 10.4 μL master mix (7.2 μL of TdT buffer 5×, 1.2 μL labeling reagent, and 2 μL TdT 30 UI/μL). PCR cycling conditions were 37°C for 30 minutes and 95°C for 5 minutes. Then, the labeled PCR product was placed for at least 5 minutes in 0°C for hybridization.</p><p>Hybridization, washing, and sample scanning</p><p>The hybridization procedure was carried out for 16 hours at 56°C using a hybridization oven (model 640, Affymetrix). Microarrays were then washed and stained in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station. A computer CEL file containing microarray images was produced by an Affymetrix G7 scanner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis, interpretation, and reanalysis</head><p>The scanned image of the microarray was analyzed using GSEQ 4.0 software, which produced a CHP file containing the names and the sequences identified in each sample. Sequences were stored in a FASTA file, which was submitted online to retest the sequences on the manufacturer's website (http://www2.gsu.edu/~psyrab/gseq/index.html). Sequences of the pathogens identified in the FASTA file contained the results of the positive and negative controls and an overview of the sequences, including their name, C3 score, homology percentage, and length of the longest continuous sequence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Mexico has suffered at least four outbreaks produced by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, with higher mortality rates than those reported by other countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> As mentioned, there are viral and host factors, 18,7,22 timeliness of medical treatment of the disease, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">37</ref> and presence of copathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">40</ref> associated with increased severity of disease caused by this virus, among other factors, which may explain the epidemiological scenario in Mexico. During the first outbreaks of the virus in Mexico, increased mortality was noted because of the presence of coinfections with other pathogens.</p><p>20,31 Therefore, it is of paramount importance to investigate which organisms are causing coinfections to implement a monitoring and surveillance system for the disease in Mexico.</p><p>Here, we used the standard qRT-PCR protocol to identify the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in conjunction with a microarray assay for detecting other associated pathogens in positive patients to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The microarray assay has been shown to be capable of detecting in a single sample up to 30 viruses and bacteria that may produce ILI. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> The identification of such pathogens is based on sequence analysis and subsequent search in the GenBank database, which helps to identify specific viral types and species of bacteria present in the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>28,43</head><p>There was a significantly high prevalence rate of influenza patients with one and three associated pathogens ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref>). The bacteria species most frequently identified was S. pneumoniae (39.8% of total individuals with copathogens), which differs somewhat with percentages (7.5%-18.6%) reported elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">29</ref> H. influenzae (32.9%) and N. meningitidis (25%) also showed high prevalence rates. N. meningitidis is associated with greater severity of illness but requires a process of immunosuppression by patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">23</ref> Other associated pathogens that presented elevated prevalence rates were S. mitis (23.9%) and P. aeruginosa (14.7%), which coincide with other studies that reported (1%-13.9%) coinfections with those pathogens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">29</ref> However, when comparing the results of this study with previous studies, prudence should be exercised, given that anatomic sites sampled and techniques of detection (and sensitivity and specificity) were somewhat different.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the presence of a high number of patients harboring several pathogens producing respiratory infections can be explained by considering the sanitary conditions of a particular country. For example, the prevalence of meningococcal disease varies among countries: 0.3-4 cases per 100,000 people. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">36</ref> In addition, there were only three cases where the pandemic virus was found in coinfection with parainfluenza 3 and Coxsackie virus. The results of our study are consistent with other studies that have reported lower rates of viral coinfections with respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus without significant complications or increase in the severity of the disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">40</ref> Similarly, some associations were found in most patients with certain signs and/or symptoms with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 alone and with other pathogens <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 3)</ref>.

One study found that the majority of S. aureus isolated in both children and adults were methicillin resistant. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> As a consequence, she was treated as inpatient in an intensive care unit.</p><p>The other two dead patients were asthmatic. They presumably died because adults and children with asthma are more likely to develop pneumonia after getting sick with the flu than people who do not have asthma (https://www.cdc. gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/updated/treating-influenza-2017. pdf). The 22-year-old male harbored S. pneumoniae, which appears to have a synergistic relationship with influenza. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">38</ref> This patient should have been treated on an inpatient basis and sent to the intensive care unit, as he was asthmatic and presented 10 different symptoms. However, he was treated on an outpatient basis. The 8-month-old male had eight symptoms and harbored S. mitis, which could have elevated the risk of and exacerbated the influenza infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>A total of 21 of 88 H1N1 patients harbored S. mitis. All H1N1 patients who had complications and those that were submitted to intensive care units were treated with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. An increase in the number of S. mitis cases could also have hampered the efficacy of the viral neuraminidase inhibitor drug. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Of the four H1N1 patients who died, S. mitis was present in three.</p><p>Copathogens were found in a significant number (&gt;50%) of influenza cases in Oaxaca. Although some copathogens may be simply asymptomatic colonizing bacteria, other manifested proven coinfection and disease severity in some patients. Given that copathogens were found commonly, this could have an impact on the disease, but more studies need to be conducted, eg, investigating if coinfections between the pandemic virus and other pathogens can be the source of secondary infections when patients are in a status of immunosuppression. Moreover, other factors explain the increase in the severity of symptoms and mortality rate caused by H1N1 in Oaxaca. It has been noted that in areas of Oaxaca, sanitary conditions are not adequate, and this may allow proliferation of the pathogenic agents detected. A monitoring and surveillance system based on molecular diagnostics for all respiratory pathogens should be implemented, as well as strengthening of sanitary measures in the local Oaxaca population, both of which are urgently needed.</p></div>
