<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Background: Deaths of celebrities, especially by suicide, can be followed by an increase in population suicide rates, particularly where there is extensive media reporting. We have examined the impact on suicides following the death of a famous Hong Kong pop singer whose death from suicide by jumping from a height, occurred on 1st April 2003, and resulted in extensive and often dramatic media coverage. Methods: Data on suicides were obtained from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department and the Coroner's Court. The numbers of suicides in 2003 before and after the death of celebrity were compared to the same period in 1998-2002. The case files and suicide notes of people who died by suicide in 2003 were also studied qualitatively. Results: There was a significant increase in suicides following the celebrity death, compared with the average over the preceding three months as well as the corresponding monthly average during 1998-2002. It was particularly marked in a subgroup comprising males, aged 25-39 years, many of whom died by jumping. The name of the celebrity was often mentioned in case files and suicide notes. Limitations: The statistical results in showing the excess of suicides were based on aggregated data only. Conclusions: This study provides further confirmation of the potential harmful consequences of sensational and excessive reporting of celebrity deaths.</p></div>

It appears that media reports on celebrity suicides are more likely to have such an effect than those of non-celebrity suicides <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Stack, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wasserman, 1984)</ref>. Furthermore, the impact of suicides of entertainment celebrities appears to have a larger impact than that of other types of celebrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Stack, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wasserman, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, young people seem to be more vulnerable to media influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hawton and Williams, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zahl and Hawton, 2004)</ref>. People come to learn the details of methods of suicide through media reporting of them, such as asphyxiation from the smoke of burning charcoal, especially in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chan et al., 2005)</ref>. Suicide deaths by charcoal burning have increased from 3% in 1997 to 24% in 2002 of the total suicide death . The relationship between media reporting of non-fictional suicides and subsequent suicides can reasonably be regarded as causal <ref type="bibr">(Hawton and Williams, 2005, p. 303;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pirkis and Blood, 2001, p. 150)</ref>.</p><p>However, few studies have investigated the effects of celebrity suicides and the media reporting of them in Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Takahashi, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Au et al., 2004)</ref>, despite extensive mass media exposure and traditional idolization of celebrities within the region.</p><p>Leslie Cheung, a Hong Kong pop singer and actor who became famous during in the 1980s and 1990s, suffered from depression and committed suicide by jumping from a height on 1st  <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(WiserNews, 2003)</ref>. Of the 1243 articles, 565 (46%) of them mentioned his full name or his nickname in the headline and 35 (3%) were on the front page of the newspapers. On six of the eight days between the 2nd and 9th April (except 4th April and 5th April) at least one newspaper reported news of Cheung's death on the front page. Most of the newspaper articles were published in the first 16 days after his death (1701 articles). During the subsequent 16 days there were 315 articles, and during the next 16 days only 102 articles.</p><p>The specific aims of this study were to answer the following questions: (i) Was there a significant increase in suicides following the death of Cheung? (ii) Was there a particularly vulnerable group in the community more likely to be affected by news of Cheung's suicide? and (iii) Was there any difference in the profile of vulnerable people compared to those reported from similar studies in western countries?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>Mortality data (including suicides) in Hong Kong, SAR during the period 1998 to 2003 were made available by the Census and Statistics Department and the Coroner's Court. All suicide deaths, coded in the range of E950-E959 were classified and recorded according to the ICD-9 standard <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 1978)</ref>.   <ref type="bibr">Research and Prevention, 2005)</ref>. Therefore to allow a robust comparison of the monthly distribution of suicides against the background of this increasing trend, we detrended the monthly suicide numbers by subtracting the mean of the first six months in the corresponding year from the monthly figures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kaiser and Maravall, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Harvey and Proietti, 2005)</ref>. The number of suicides in April 2003 was compared with the average for the first six months of the year, the average for the immediately preceding three months <ref type="bibr">(January-March 2003)</ref>, and with the average for April in the preceding 5 years <ref type="bibr">(1998)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1999)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2000)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref>. A chi-square test was used to examine the significance of differences in distribution. In addition, we also examined the Coroner's death reports as well suicide notes for suicide deaths in 2003, and identified those which mentioned Cheung's death.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 1a and 1b</ref> suggest that the increase in suicides in April 2003 was most marked for suicide by jumping from a height and among males aged 25-39 years. In that month, 42 male suicide deaths involved jumping from a height, which was 11 more than monthly average for the first six months of 2003. It was also 72% greater than the monthly average for the previous three months of <ref type="bibr">2003 (24.3</ref>  While there was a small rise in suicides by females in April 2003 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3)</ref>, the number of suicides (N = 42) was not significantly different from the monthly average for the preceding three months in 2003. There were 7.2 more suicide cases than the average detrended monthly figure for the April average in the previous five years. There was little change in the number of suicides by method in females during the study period <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 2)</ref>.    </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Information from Coroner's death investigation files and suicide notes</head><p>Any unnatural death (including suicide) in Hong Kong is investigated by Coroners, who are normally assisted by a police investigation of the circumstance and cause of the death (Coroner Court, 1998). The police reports and suicide notes provide another source of information about factors contributing to suicide. There were 13 cases in 2003 in which the death of Cheung was mentioned in either a suicide note (5 cases) or records of the police investigation (8 cases). In one case there was mention in both sources. The cases occurred between April and October 2003. The contents of the deaths notes are summarized in Appendix A. Among these 13 cases, nine were male and six of these were aged 25-39 years. Four individuals expressed their suicidal intentions implicitly or explicitly by mentioning their desire either "to accompany Cheung" or "to follow his way to exit" (Cases 6, 10, 11 and 12). The remaining three individuals included people with life problems (Cases 8 and 9) and general distress (Case 13). It is unusual for a celebrity to be mentioned in a suicide note and only about 20% of suicides in Hong Kong are accompanied by suicide notes. The content of these notes commonly states the victim's specific instructions, including funeral arrangement, expresses affection for family members and loved ones, and gives details of the individual's own personal difficulties, health and/or financial problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ho et al., 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This study showed an unusual rise in suicide cases in April 2003 in males, aged 25-39, who committed suicide by jumping from a height following the suicide death by jumping of a Hong Kong pop star. However, the overall effect on suicides appears to have been relatively short lived. Other research on celebrity suicides or deaths has also shown relatively short-term effects on suicides, usually of between two and four weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hawton et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Phillips, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Stack, 1987)</ref>. It is important to note that there was no significant decrease in suicides in May or June 2003. This is consistent with previous studies which have rejected the hypothesis that the imitative effect caused suicides to occur earlier than would otherwise have been the case <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hawton et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Phillips, 1974)</ref>. However, the death investigation files from the Coroner's Court showed that some further individuals who died by suicide between May and October 2003 had also mentioned the name of Cheung in suicide notes. This suggests the possibility that celebrity suicide could have a longer-term effect, even though it might be insufficient to have a significant effect on the aggregated monthly suicide rate.</p><p>Studies of the effects of celebrity suicides or other death have shown specific effects on subsequent suicides in terms of gender and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hawton et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hawton and Williams, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Schmidtke and Häfner, 1988)</ref>. Cheung died at the age of 46 years. According to his fan club website (http://lesliecheung.cc), "A turning point in Cheung's career" was the release of his album "Monica" in 1984, when he was 28 years old. The cohort of teenagers who were more likely to be keen on pop music in 1984 and who were probably more able to identify with the behaviour of Cheung would have been in the 25-39 year age group in 2003.</p><p>The results of this study suggest not only a modelling effect, based on the characteristics of the model, but also an imitation of the actual suicide method. The effect of the suicide of Gaetan Girouard in Quebec was similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Tousignant et al., 2005)</ref>. Portrayal of a suicide method on television has been shown to be associated with an increase in suicidal behaviour by that specific method <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hawton et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shoval et al., 2005)</ref>. The major increase in suicide deaths in Hong Kong was among males aged 25-39 years. This suggests that the characteristics of the model were crucial factors in the overall imitative effect. In western countries media effects have been found in both genders and in the very young <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Schmidtke and Schaller, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Three other factors may have contributed to a rise in suicides in April 2003, namely high unemployment, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and a seasonal effect. If the high unemployment rate contributed to the rise in suicides the effect should have been seen not only in April but for an extended period. Also, the months of May-July period and not April had the highest unemployment rate (8.5%) in Hong Kong. Furthermore, it should have affected the community as a whole rather than a particular subgroup, and a particular method of suicide. Though the outbreak of SARS hits Hong Kong badly, there was no marked increase in suicides during May and June even though the community was still very much in the midst of SARS throughout the territory. In addition there was no increase in suicides during the SARS crisis in Singapore, which was also severely affected in 2003 <ref type="bibr">(Chia, in preparation)</ref>. Finally, research in Hong Kong has shown no evidence of significant seasonal variation in suicides in either gender and certainly no indication of an April peak <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Yip and Yang, 2004</ref>). While it is still not possible to be absolutely certain that the rise in suicide deaths in April 2003 was mainly due to media reporting of Cheung's death, the evidence strongly suggests that it was, especially because of the very marked increase in suicides in young adult males, the excess of deaths by jumping, and the evidence from suicide notes and police files. This conclusion is consistent with research from other countries which has shown that the death of a celebrity can ignite a contagious effect within a community <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hawton et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Takahashi, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tousignant et al., 2005)</ref>. For this reason, the World Health Organization has listed "toning down reports in the media" as one of its six key strategies on suicide prevention <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 1998)</ref>. Improving media reporting and portrayal of suicidal behaviour is also one of the major initiatives included in the national suicide prevention strategies of several countries (Commonwealth of Australia, 2000; Department of <ref type="bibr">Health and Human Services, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Department of Health, 2002)</ref>. Media professionals should be well informed about the potential risks associated with reporting celebrity suicides. Several media guidelines are available to assist media professionals on how to report suicide news in a responsible manner (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2002; Center for Suicide <ref type="bibr">Research and Prevention, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Samaritans, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2000)</ref>. However, a systematic review of suicide prevention strategies has highlighted the need for evaluation of the effectiveness of such guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Mann et al., 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Limitations</head><p>The results of this study are largely based on aggregated statistical data. The level of exposure of individuals to the news of Cheung's death was not examined.</p><p>We cannot be certain of the mechanisms involved in the increase in suicides following Cheung's death. It might have been due to bereavement effects of his death rather than a modeling effect of celebrity suicide. However, our analysis of suicide notes and police reports suggests that copycat suicidal behaviour is likely to have been the main mechanism.</p></div>
