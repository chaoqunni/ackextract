<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Integrating research on polychronicity, team diversity, and team cognition, we hypothesized that shared temporal cognition (overlapping knowledge) and temporal transactive memory systems (differentiated knowledge) would moderate the effects of polychronicity diversity on team performance. Results from 71 teams in an Indian organization revealed opposing moderating effects in that shared temporal cognition attenuated, but temporal transactive memory systems amplified, the negative effects of polychronicity diversity on team performance. Shared temporal cognition also exerted a strong, positive effect on team performance. Study results provide support for the continued examination of polychronicity diversity and temporal team cognition.</p></div>

Individuals often enter teams with diverse temporal orientations, which have been recognized as deeply ingrained, fundamental parameters of individual differences <ref type="bibr" coords="1,239.88,395.85,48.18,8.10;1,48.00,406.85,57.67,8.10" target="#b13">(Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988)</ref>. Practically, time-based characteristics are one of the most task-relevant attributes in today's business world, where effective time management is an imperative for organizations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,48.00,439.85,110.07,8.10" target="#b21">Clemens &amp; Dalrymple, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,161.52,439.85,49.05,8.10" target="#b78">Pearce, 2011)</ref>. Theoretically, temporal diversity has been proposed as the underlying mechanism contributing to the temporal problems specified in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,249.07,461.85,38.99,8.10;1,48.00,472.85,23.99,8.10" target="#b63">McGrath's (1991)</ref> time, interaction, and performance (TIP) theory <ref type="bibr" coords="1,254.07,472.85,29.13,8.10;1,48.00,483.85,88.26,8.10" target="#b68">(Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>. Empirically, temporal differences have been shown to be an important form of deep-level diversity, with relevance for team conflict <ref type="bibr" coords="1,146.12,505.85,107.35,8.10" target="#b65">(Mohammed &amp; Angell, 2004)</ref> and team performance <ref type="bibr" coords="1,96.62,516.85,172.80,8.10" target="#b30">(Gevers, Claessens, van Eerde, &amp; Rutte, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,272.56,516.85,10.33,8.10;1,48.00,527.85,102.09,8.10" target="#b68">Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The present study adds to a small number of studies testing temporal heterogeneity in teams and extends prior findings in two key ways. First, we expand the range of temporal individual differences previously investigated with respect to diversity. Thus far, research has explored heterogeneity on three temporal individual differences: time urgency (chronic hurriedness and the need to control deadlines), pacing style (pattern of effort distribution over time in working toward deadlines), and future time perspective (cognitive temporal bias toward being future oriented; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,518.33,384.85,27.74,8.10;1,306.00,395.85,84.38,8.10" target="#b30">Gevers, Claessens, et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,393.27,395.85,106.39,8.10" target="#b65">Mohammed &amp; Angell, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,502.53,395.85,43.50,8.10;1,306.00,406.85,70.44,8.10" target="#b68">Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>. Whereas these temporal characteristics describe how quickly work is done (time urgency), how activities are spaced over time (pacing style), and how likely individuals are to concentrate on the past, present, or future (time perspective), none capture patterns of simultaneity in how work is accomplished. Simultaneity or preference for multitasking is important to investigate because it has been identified as a fundamental life strategy representing underlying core assumptions about time usage <ref type="bibr" coords="1,523.05,483.85,19.16,8.10;1,306.00,494.85,40.25,8.10" target="#b12">(Bluedorn, 2002)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" coords="1,401.52,494.85,50.62,8.10" target="#b49">Kaplan (2009)</ref>, the "decision to work on one versus multiple tasks has consequences that transcend traditional work outcomes (e.g., performance, satisfaction), but also drives the way in which life, including work, is perceived and experienced" (p. 105). Capturing this notion, polychronicity is defined as the preference for doing several tasks simultaneously rather than sequentially <ref type="bibr" coords="1,399.09,560.84,146.96,8.10;1,306.00,571.84,19.37,8.10" target="#b14">(Bluedorn, Kalliath, Strube, &amp; Martin, 1999)</ref>. As such, the construct represents a significant feature of time-based tendencies relevant to team tasks that is unaddressed by other temporal constructs. Polychronicity is increasingly recognized as an "important employee trait that has specific and clear relevance to the eclectic and fast-paced" work environment <ref type="bibr" coords="1,519.81,615.84,26.24,8.10;1,306.00,626.84,119.96,8.10">(Arndt, Arnold, &amp; Landry, 2006, p. 320)</ref>.</p><p>As a time-based characteristic unique from other temporal individual differences, polychronicity diversity is important to examine because teams have been described as "multitasking units that perform multiple processes simultaneously and sequentially to orchestrate goal-directed task work" (Marks, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,470.61,681.84,75.44,8.10;1,306.00,692.84,49.07,8.10">Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001, p. 356)</ref>. Because organizations often form teams with the expectation that they will simultaneously coordinate multiple projects <ref type="bibr" coords="1,322.04,714.84,53.78,8.10" target="#b49">(Kaplan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,377.86,714.84,141.26,8.10" target="#b76">O'Leary, Mortensen, &amp; Woolley, 2011)</ref>, teams are increasingly expected to juggle numerous and diverse tasks under time-pressured and dynamic conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,235.48,87.85,52.57,8.10;2,48.00,98.85,20.50,8.10" target="#b76">O'Leary et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,73.76,98.85,182.27,8.10" target="#b95">Tannenbaum, Mathieu, Salas, &amp; Cohen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.29,98.85,26.74,8.10;2,48.00,109.85,19.37,8.10" target="#b100">Waller, 1997)</ref>. This increased emphasis on multitasking in teams renders the preference to complete tasks in a simultaneous (polychronic) versus sequential (monochronic) manner germane to understanding team performance. Despite its significance for collective settings, our understanding of how polychronicity operates in teams is markedly deficient because polychronicity has been mainly examined at the individual level (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,198.09,175.85,89.94,8.10" target="#b22">Conte &amp; Gintoft, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,186.85,79.10,8.10" target="#b39">Hecht &amp; Allen, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Studies addressing group polychronicity not only are sparse but also have mainly examined mean-level effects, assuming that team members possess comparable temporal preferences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.06,219.85,25.83,8.10;2,48.00,230.85,172.27,8.10" target="#b69">Mohammed, Rizzuto, Hiller, Neuman, &amp; Chen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.52,230.85,59.76,8.10;2,48.00,241.85,40.87,8.10" target="#b90">Souitaris &amp; Maestro, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,93.49,241.85,173.57,8.10" target="#b101">Waller, Giambatista, &amp; Zellmer-Bruhn, 1999)</ref>. We challenge this assumption by addressing the performance effects of teams composed of a diverse mix of monochronic and polychronic members. Examining diversity may uncover multifaceted effects of team polychronicity beyond the simple additive effects of mean.</p><p>A second way in which the current study extends prior work is by introducing a new category of moderator of the temporal diversity-team performance relationship: team cognition. Diversity of temporal individual differences is considered to be a double-edged sword for team performance, with the potential to yield both negative outcomes (e.g., increased dissatisfaction, conflict, and process loss; decreased cohesion and coordination) and positive outcomes (e.g., expanded range of backgrounds and taskrelevant expertise, temporal synergy; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.19,384.85,95.86,8.10" target="#b7">Bartel &amp; Milliken, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,395.85,119.28,8.10" target="#b67">Mohammed &amp; Harrison, 2013)</ref>. Consistent with a theoretical framework suggesting moderation, the limited empirical work on temporal diversity has found insignificant main effects, but significant interactive effects, on team effectiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.26,428.85,70.82,8.10;2,48.00,439.85,42.01,8.10" target="#b30">(Gevers, Claessens, et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,92.01,439.85,103.76,8.10" target="#b65">Mohammed &amp; Angell, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,197.78,439.85,90.25,8.10;2,48.00,450.85,19.37,8.10" target="#b68">Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>. Building on this prior work, we also hypothesize moderation but expand to consider the role of how knowledge is collectively represented within the team.</p><p>To date, studies have explored mean pacing style <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.30,483.85,30.73,8.10;2,48.00,494.85,85.61,8.10" target="#b30">(Gevers, Claessens, et al., 2009)</ref>, team processes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.47,494.85,87.58,8.10;2,48.00,505.85,19.37,8.10" target="#b65">(Mohammed &amp; Angell, 2004)</ref>, and team temporal leadership <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.79,505.85,97.26,8.10;2,48.00,516.85,21.00,8.10" target="#b68">(Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref> as moderators of the relationship between temporal diversity and team outcomes. Specifically, pacing style diversity had a negative effect on performance in teams with an early action style but a positive effect on performance in teams with a deadline action style <ref type="bibr" coords="2,93.71,560.84,118.78,8.10" target="#b30">(Gevers, Claessens, et al., 2009)</ref>. In a second study, team processes aided in weakening the negative effects of time urgency diversity on relationship conflict <ref type="bibr" coords="2,202.00,582.84,86.05,8.10;2,48.00,593.84,19.37,8.10" target="#b65">(Mohammed &amp; Angell, 2004)</ref>. Most recently, the effect of time urgency and pacing style diversity on team performance was more positive when team temporal leadership (team leader behaviors that aid in coordinating and managing the pacing of task accomplishment) was high <ref type="bibr" coords="2,269.55,626.84,13.87,8.10;2,48.00,637.84,101.68,8.10" target="#b68">(Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>. A missing category from this list of moderators is team cognition, a central construct in the team literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,102.81,659.84,152.19,8.10" target="#b61">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.03,659.84,25.83,8.10;2,48.00,670.84,120.28,8.10" target="#b66">Mohammed, Ferzandi, &amp; Hamilton, 2010</ref>) that has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of expert teams (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.72,681.84,95.72,8.10;2,48.00,692.84,74.14,8.10" target="#b86">Salas, Rosen, Burke, Goodwin, &amp; Fiore, 2006)</ref>. This omission is especially regrettable because the manner by which knowledge is represented in the team could serve as an organizing mechanism to leverage member diversity. In a previous study examining team performance as the dependent variable, a formal team leader helped to amplify the positive effects and/or mitigate the negative effects of pacing style and time urgency diversity in a top-down manner <ref type="bibr" coords="2,489.81,110.45,56.22,8.10;2,306.00,121.66,57.09,8.10" target="#b68">(Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>. However, what remains to be explored is whether temporal team cognition, as a bottom-up construct emerging from members (e.g., DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010), could fulfill a similar purpose for polychronicity diversity effects on team performance.</p><p>Given the time-based nature of polychronicity, we focused on temporal team cognition. Temporality has not been well developed in the team cognition literature, despite numerous calls for greater integration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,367.68,211.29,143.14,8.10" target="#b70">Mohammed, Tesler, &amp; Hamilton, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,513.04,211.29,32.99,8.10;2,306.00,222.50,67.86,8.10" target="#b91">Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, we investigated two types of temporal team cognition: shared temporal cognition (STC; common understanding of the time-related aspects of executing collective tasks) and temporal transactive memory systems (temporal TMS; the set of unique knowledge domains held by specific members combined with a shared understanding of who knows what and when that knowledge is needed in the team). These two constructs were selected because they represent a major point of differentiation among types of team cognition: knowledge as overlapping/ convergent (STC) or differentiated/complementary (temporal TMS) among team members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,433.28,334.51,112.75,8.10;2,306.00,345.70,20.50,8.10" target="#b25">DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,329.62,345.72,89.71,8.10" target="#b66">Mohammed et al., 2010)</ref>. 1 Thus, the current study extends prior research by contrasting the extent to which members "on the same temporal page," or possessing unique knowledge needed at different points in time, helps to minimize the negative effects and maximize the positive effects of polychronicity diversity on team performance. We tested our model on 71 teams in a medium-sized business process outsourcing company in India, a temporally relevant context in which members were tasked with juggling multiple client demands under tight deadlines. Our results contribute to existing research in several ways. First, as the first to examine polychronicity diversity in teams, our study highlights the need to move away from a purely mean-based examination of team-level polychronicity and to recognize polychronicity as an important form of deeplevel diversity in teams. Second, our study specifies the conditions (STC and temporal TMS) under which polychronicity diversity can enhance or hamper team performance. The contingent relationship of team polychronicity diversity on performance found in our study is notable, because "showing that polychronicity matters -or more likely showing under what conditions it matters" has been identified as "a key task for future polychronicity research" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,510.35,569.58,35.71,8.10;2,306.00,580.78,75.52,8.10">(König &amp; Waller, 2010, p. 185)</ref>. Third, by delineating the moderating effects of two distinct forms of team cognition, we respond to repeated calls to combine overlapping (shared temporal cognition) and differentiated (temporal TMS) team cognition in the same study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,76.85,164.65,8.10">(e.g., DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,217.20,76.85,70.84,8.10;3,48.00,87.85,15.50,8.10" target="#b87">Salas &amp; Wildman, 2009</ref>).</p></div>

First, the schedules and task priorities of monochronic and polychronic team members are often contradictory. Due to their preference for task closure and for devoting their undivided attention to the task at hand, monochronics excel at deadline adherence, whereas polychronics struggle with punctuality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,201.75,637.85,86.30,8.10;3,48.00,648.85,44.89,8.10" target="#b15">Bluedorn, Kaufman, &amp; Lane, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,97.04,648.85,86.56,8.10" target="#b23">Conte &amp; Jacobs, 2003)</ref>. Polychronics are adept at intermixing unscheduled and scheduled events, whereas monochronics view unscheduled events as interruptions until the task they are currently working on is completed. These conflicting tendencies may increase dissatisfaction among team members, lower cohesion, and decrease motivation and commitment to achieving task goals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,152.08,714.85,95.77,8.10" target="#b7">Bartel &amp; Milliken, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,252.19,714.85,35.85,8.10;3,306.00,76.85,49.94,8.10" target="#b11">Blount &amp; Janicik, 2002)</ref>, each of which can reduce team performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.00,87.91,152.19,8.10" target="#b8">Beal, Cohen, Burke, &amp; McLendon, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,461.03,87.91,81.13,8.10" target="#b20">Chen &amp; Kanfer, 2006)</ref>.

According to <ref type="bibr" coords="3,418.21,419.60,46.98,8.10" target="#b54">Leroy (2009)</ref>, schedules, priorities, as well as large, demanding tasks often require employees to dedicate their full attention to the work at hand without being distracted by other unrelated tasks or projects . . . . Yet, in order to make enough progress on each project, meet their deadlines, and respect their schedule, time must be shared and people must regularly transition among their projects. That is, they must frequently stop working on one task, finished or unfinished, to switch to and fully focus on another. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,381.31,508.67,25.99,7.20">(p. 168)</ref> This dilemma is effectively handled by combining the flexibility of polychronic members who prefer to simultaneously juggle numerous competing responsibilities with the focus of monochronic members who prefer to sequentially devote undivided attention to a task. Thus, in complex team environments that require multiple performance criteria, high polychronicity diversity may be beneficial when the strengths of monochronics (achieving superior quality by focusing on a single course of action) and those of polychronics (increasing the quantity of outputs by managing several projects concurrently) are integrated toward maximizing the amount and accuracy of team output.</p><p>The potential for two-sided effects of polychronicity diversity highlights the importance of identifying relevant moderators in understanding the complex relationship between polychronicity diversity and team performance. As such, we extend the nascent temporal diversity research by introducing a new category of moderator: team cognition.

Following the TIP theory, recent research has underscored the need to place time at the forefront of team cognition by explicitly incorporating temporal referents in specific facets of team cognition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,86.31,439.35,90.59,8.10" target="#b70">Mohammed et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,179.94,439.35,104.22,8.10" target="#b91">Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differences in the Nature of Knowledge Sharing: STC and Temporal TMS</head><p>Although both emerge in a bottom-up fashion from individual cognition, a noteworthy distinction is that shared cognition reflects knowledge that is held in common by team members, whereas TMS also reflects knowledge that is distributed across team members (e.g., DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,231.83,582.85,56.20,8.10;4,48.00,593.85,19.37,8.10" target="#b83">Ren &amp; Argote, 2011)</ref>. Whereas STC enables team members to be on the same temporal page regarding task information (e.g., deadlines and schedules), a key point of distinction for TMS is the differentiated knowledge structures that members possess. With STC, the focus is on the congruence between teammates' beliefs about the key aspects of tasks. With temporal TMS, the emphasis is on the complementary patterning of individual knowledge, which is then combined with an awareness of who knows what and when that unique knowledge is needed in the team. Because of their respective emphasis on overlapping and differentiated knowledge, the process by which STC and temporal TMS emerges to become a collective phenomenon is structurally dissimilar <ref type="bibr" coords="4,236.63,714.85,51.42,8.10;4,306.00,76.85,59.31,8.10" target="#b73">(Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999)</ref>.

Given the differences underlying overlapping and differentiated knowledge, STC should serve as a homogenizing function to facilitate a common understanding of the time-related aspects of completing team tasks, whereas a temporal TMS should serve a distributed function to facilitate specialized areas of expertise along with a shared awareness of whom, what, and when.

High levels of STC indicate that members concur on the temporal strategy for a project, including agreement on specific deadlines, how quickly the team should work to meet the deadline, and how the work should be scheduled over time. In contrast, low levels of STC signify that team members place unequal value on meeting deadlines and/or "have entirely different schedules in mind, disagreeing not only about when to start the work on the project as a whole, but potentially also about when to start and finish the work on specific subtasks" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,343.49,538.85,158.68,8.10">(Gevers, van Eerde, &amp; Rutte, 2009, p. 298)</ref>.</p><p>As an emergent construct deriving from individual-level cognition but manifesting as a collective phenomenon, STC develops through social interaction processes such as participation, communication, and negotiation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,399.60,582.85,94.60,8.10" target="#b7">(Bartel &amp; Milliken, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,497.15,582.85,48.89,8.10;4,306.00,593.85,19.37,8.10" target="#b32">Gevers et al., 2004)</ref>.

In terms of function, limited empirical research has found that STC positively influences coordinated action and meeting deadlines <ref type="bibr" coords="5,248.69,153.85,39.35,8.10;5,48.00,164.85,52.00,8.10" target="#b31">(Gevers &amp; Peeters, 2009;</ref>. Although our focus is on its moderating influence, we expect STC to have a positive, direct relationship with team performance. The process of reaching agreement on specific deadlines, scheduling, and pacing increases the likelihood that members will (a) become more cognizant of polychronicity differences in the team and (b) be more willing to accommodate each other's multitasking or monotasking preferences. First, the frequent social interaction that gives rise to STC "can expose similarities and differences in members' temporal perceptions either explicitly (through actual statements or assertions made by members themselves) or implicitly (through inferences members make about others)" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,252.74,285.85,35.32,8.10;5,48.00,296.85,84.68,8.10">(Bartel &amp; Milliken, 2004, p. 103)</ref>. Second, "shared cognitions on time will facilitate team members to structure their behavior to fit with external temporal demands and to adapt to each others' actions" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,48.00,329.85,99.15,8.10">(Gevers et al., 2004, p. 81</ref>). As such, establishing a "collective temporal reference point" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,147.70,340.85,100.53,8.10">(Gevers et al., 2004, p. 74</ref>) makes it more probable that members will adjust their behavior, at least in the short term, to meet team temporal goals, although their underlying multitasking preferences would remain stable. For example, monochronics may temporarily agree to answer e-mails and phone calls to assist team members who need timely responses, despite their preference for devoting undivided attention to the task at hand. Also fostered by achieving greater consensus on temporal issues, a longer term solution may involve better understanding and anticipating each others' actions <ref type="bibr" coords="5,191.78,439.85,78.13,8.10" target="#b32">(Gevers et al., 2004)</ref>. To illustrate, team members may work together to minimize interruptions for monochronics during periods of task concentration and build more lead time into schedules to accommodate polychronics' struggles with punctuality. Thus, "a common temporal understanding fosters an "awareness, acceptance, and intentional blending of each member's temporal perspective" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,198.71,505.85,89.36,8.10;5,48.00,516.85,47.99,8.10">(Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006, p. 918)</ref>.</p><p>We therefore propose that STC leverages the benefits of polychronicity diversity and/or minimizes process losses on team performance. Agreeing on deadlines, schedules, and pacing helps to harmonize individual work cycles, thereby increasing the opportunity for monochronic and polychronic member strengths to complement (rather than conflict with) each other. With the homogenizing influence of shared temporal cognition, the benefits of focus and task execution (monochronicity) can be optimally combined with the benefits of flexibility and task juggling (polychronicity) to meet the multifaceted performance criteria (e.g., quantity, quality) of modern day teams. Alternatively, STC may act as a mitigating influence to help quell the potential tensions that may naturally arise between polychronic and monochronic members. In the absence of a common understanding regarding temporal milestones and scheduling, the mixture of sequential and simultaneous working styles is likely to exacerbate dissatisfaction, conflict, and coordination difficulties. Consequently, polychronicity diversity, coupled with different estimations of the time needed to complete various tasks (low shared temporal cognition), could undermine task accomplishment.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: STC moderates the relationship between polychronicity diversity and team performance such that polychronicity diversity will be more positively related to team performance when STC is higher and/or more negatively related to team performance when STC is lower.</p></div>

Because information that is relevant but not timely may fall through the cracks, social interaction and shared experiences help teammates learn when knowledge should be brought to bear in team interactions and how to synchronize knowledge from different members. In mature temporal TMS, members form convergent and accurate member-expertise associations that are linked to temporal referents. As teams with more developed TMS have benefited from higher performance (e.g., DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010), we similarly anticipated that temporal TMS will positively influence team performance.</p><p>We expect that by promoting a shared understanding of whom, what, and when, a temporal TMS may provide a team-level organizing template to harness the strengths of monochronic and polychronic members to improve performance. According to the TIP theory, a "temporally efficient flow of work in groups requires complex matching of bundles of activities to particular periods of time [emphasis added]" <ref type="bibr" coords="6,140.22,318.85,87.67,8.10">(McGrath, 1991, p.163)</ref>. As such, both project quality and quantity can be maximized when team tasks are properly sequenced across the project life cycle, so that monochronic members can concentrate fully on a single assignment until task closure and polychronic members can maintain project momentum by working on multiple and competing activities simultaneously. Thus, what is critical for performance is not just a collective awareness of unique domain-related knowledge possessed by each member but a shared sense of when that expertise is needed through time-based specialization. Lacking a temporal TMS, polychronic members will have difficulty identifying the unique expertise of monochronic members (and vice versa) as well as predicting which members will contribute to what part of the task and when those contributions are needed. Devoid of an organizing mechanism by which members coordinate when differentiated knowledge will be brought to bear during the project timeline, the probability is high that the strengths of monochronics and polychronics in the team will be squandered because of the failure to match monochronics and polychronics to the appropriate task at the appropriate time in the task cycle. According to the TIP theory, allocation of temporal resources to tasks and synchronization of activities are the recommended responses to the problems of conflicting temporal interests and scarcity of temporal resources <ref type="bibr" coords="6,48.00,571.84,60.10,8.10" target="#b63">(McGrath, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to enhancing the benefits, a temporal TMS may mitigate the conflicts and tensions between monochronics and polychronics in a team.

Supplemental analyses reported in the Results section demonstrate that the moderator (team temporal leadership) from the published article did not explain the relationship between polychronicity diversity and team performance. Therefore, the two articles are substantively and empirically distinct. We tested our model using teams from an Indian business process outsourcing (BPO) provider company. This company specialized in managing the front-end (e.g., customer interaction services such as telesales, customer support, and feedback) as well as the back-end (e.g., mortgage and credit card processing) functions of multinational banks.

Although temporal TMS and STC were not significantly correlated (r ϭ .16, p Ͼ .05) and variance inflation factor (all variables lower than 3.7, with most lower than 1.8) and tolerance (all variables higher than .28, with most above .6) diagnostics indicated that multicollinearity among variables in the equation was not a significant concern, multicollinearity is being driven by the same predictor (polychronicity diversity) in multiple cross-product terms. Given that a stated purpose and contribution of the study was to respond to repeated calls for research to combine overlapping and differentiated team cognition and to examine their differential effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="8,324.98,607.54,122.29,7.20" target="#b25">DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,450.05,607.54,80.42,7.20" target="#b87">Salas &amp; Wildman, 2009)</ref>, we believe that the simultaneous test of the two interactions is most consistent with our theoretical framework.

Regardless of the level of polychronicity diversity, teams had similar levels of team performance when they were low in temporal TMS but high on STC. There was a significant negative relationship between polychronicity diversity and team performance for teams low in STC but high in temporal TMS. Thus, STC helped to prevent the negative effects of polychronicity diversity on performance, whereas temporal TMS worked to amplify the negative effects of polychronicity diversity on performance. 4 Although our focus was on their moderating influences, it is worth noting that there was a strong positive main effect for STC (␤ ϭ .47, p Ͻ .01). <ref type="bibr" coords="9,57.00,447.31,96.23,8.10" target="#b7">Bartel and Milliken (2004)</ref> "encourage researchers to tease apart the differential effects that diversity in different temporal perceptions might have on work group functioning" (p. 106).

First, temporal team cognition moderated the relationship between polychronicity diversity and team performance. Second, STC and temporal TMSs exhibited distinct interactive effects with polychronicity diversity in affecting team performance.

Below, we discuss the theoretical implications, limitations, and future directions of our study.</p></div>

Researchers investigating teamlevel polychronicity have assumed that individuals possess comparable temporal preferences and collectively agree on how to structure their work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="9,400.66,442.35,51.23,8.10" target="#b49">Kaplan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,454.36,442.35,87.81,8.10" target="#b69">Mohammed et al., 2008)</ref>.

We challenge this isomorphic assumption by addressing what happens when team members exhibit a diverse mix of 4 Although specialization, credibility, and coordination must be combined to constitute a TMS <ref type="bibr" coords="9,390.54,535.54,81.31,7.20" target="#b57">(Lewis &amp; Herndon, 2011)</ref>, a recent review of the TMS literature advocated that "future studies report not only TMS as a construct, but also the value of different dimensions" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,492.36,553.54,53.65,7.20;9,306.00,562.54,17.22,7.20" target="#b83">(Ren &amp; Argote, 2011)</ref>. Following this recommendation as well as that of an anonymous reviewer, we ran a hierarchical regression with the same control variables as in <ref type="table" coords="9,324.93,580.54,24.35,7.20">Table 2</ref>: polychronicity diversity, mean levels of each of the three TMS dimensions, and three interactions between polychronicity diversity and specialization, credibility, and coordination. Results revealed a significant interaction between specialization and polychronicity diversity (␤ ϭ Ϫ.35, p Ͻ .01), accounting for an additional 14% of the variance in team performance (F 3, 56 ϭ 4.28, p Ͻ .01) beyond controls and main effects. The graph of the interaction showed a similar pattern to that of <ref type="figure" coords="9,306.00,643.54,27.32,7.20" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> for the whole temporal TMS scale. As indicated by simple slope analyses, the relationship between polychronicity diversity and team performance was significant and negative in teams with high temporal TMS (slope ϭ Ϫ1.76, t ϭ Ϫ2.56, p Ͻ .05). There was no significant difference in team performance between high and low polychronicity diversity for teams low in temporal TMS (slope ϭ .91, t ϭ 1.61, p Ͼ .05). As no significant effects emerged for credibility or coordination, specialization (emphasizing uniquely held or differentiated knowledge) is the dimension of TMS that is driving the effects exhibited in <ref type="table" coords="9,460.61,715.54,24.88,7.20">Table 2</ref>   This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Temporal team cognition. Confirming that polychronicity diversity is indeed a double-edged sword for team performance, our findings help to resolve the opposing conceptual mechanisms in the team and temporal diversity literatures by specifying the conditions under which the polychronicity diversity-team performance relationship is strengthened or weakened. In particular, we expanded emerging research on temporal diversity by introducing a new and unexplored moderator: temporal team cognition.</p><p>Through establishing that different moderators have distinctive effects on different team diversity variables, the supplemental analyses demonstrate the unique empirical contribution of this study relative to prior work. Whereas a formal team leader helped to leverage pacing style diversity in a top-down manner <ref type="bibr" coords="11,254.06,252.85,29.13,8.10;11,48.00,263.85,87.80,8.10" target="#b68">(Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>, the bottom-up nature of temporal team cognition fulfilled a similar purpose for polychronicity diversity on team performance. Perhaps whether members prefer to work sequentially or simultaneously is most evident to teammates but less visible to leaders and therefore more affected by emergent states. In addition, effective management of polychronicity diversity may require the awareness and involvement of multiple members as opposed to an intervention by a single person. Interestingly, as team processes <ref type="bibr" coords="11,110.01,351.85,114.65,8.10" target="#b65">(Mohammed &amp; Angell, 2004)</ref>, team temporal leadership <ref type="bibr" coords="11,89.37,362.85,121.75,8.10" target="#b68">(Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011)</ref>, and STC have all moderated the time urgency-team outcome linkage, this form of temporal diversity demonstrates the greatest receptivity to a variety of influences. In comparison to polychronicity and pacing style, which have been more specifically focused on work activity, the more general orientation of time urgency in being more broadly applied to a variety of human behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="11,231.26,428.85,56.78,8.10;11,48.00,439.85,58.86,8.10" target="#b67">(Mohammed &amp; Harrison, 2013)</ref> may play a role in interpreting these findings. Further research is clearly needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the differential effects of diverse forms of temporal diversity.</p><p>As team cognition research has been criticized for being temporally deficient, we responded to recommendations to integrate temporal referents into team cognition research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="11,240.67,505.85,47.40,8.10;11,48.00,516.85,20.50,8.10" target="#b32">Gevers et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,70.80,516.85,88.88,8.10" target="#b70">Mohammed et al., 2012)</ref> and are the first to extend the TMS construct to include time. Our results suggest that there is value in continuing to examine temporal team cognition in future research. In addition, few studies have holistically examined the impact of both overlapping and differentiated forms of team cognition on team outcomes (exceptions are <ref type="bibr" coords="11,165.50,571.84,56.27,8.10" target="#b27">Ellis, 2006 and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,48.00,582.84,39.78,8.10" target="#b80">Bell, 2010)</ref>, despite numerous calls to examine the two forms of team cognition in the same study <ref type="bibr" coords="11,180.70,593.84,107.33,8.10;11,48.00,604.84,55.33,8.10">(e.g., DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,106.92,604.84,91.87,8.10" target="#b87">Salas &amp; Wildman, 2009)</ref>. Finding that STC and temporal TMSs contrastingly shaped the effects of polychronicity diversity on team performance illustrates the fruitfulness of simultaneously examining both forms of team cognition.</p><p>Contrasting moderating effects of STC and temporal TMS. As predicted, the combination of low and high polychronicity team members was particularly detrimental to team performance in the absence of consensus surrounding time-related aspects of task execution. Thus, agreement on deadlines, schedules, and pacing helped to compensate for the disadvantageous aspects of mixing members with sequential and simultaneous working styles. As STC helped to reduce the negative effects but not amplify the positive effects of polychronicity diversity, additional organizing mechanisms such as behavioral integration <ref type="bibr" coords="11,463.51,99.23,64.64,8.10" target="#b35">(Hambrick, 1994)</ref> may be needed to leverage the performance benefits of combining members whose strengths are focus and task execution with those whose strengths are flexibility and task juggling.</p><p>An interesting, yet unexpected outcome was that high polychronicity diversity combined with high temporal TMS decreased performance. Therefore, whereas high STC had a mitigating effect, high temporal TMS had an exacerbating effect on the negative relationship between polychronicity diversity on team performance. In contrast to STC serving a homogenizing function to facilitate a common understanding regarding schedules and deadlines, temporal TMS served a differentiating function through combining specialized member expertise with a shared understanding of who knows what and when that knowledge was needed in the team. This differentiating function was confirmed empirically, as post hoc analyses found that specialization, the distributed aspect of TMS, is the dimension of temporal TMS that is driving the effects exhibited in <ref type="figure" coords="11,393.46,289.51,29.87,8.10" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Upon close inspection, the interactions between the two sources of temporal homogeneity/differentiation in teams-temporal composition (polychronicity) and temporal organizing mechanisms (STC and temporal TMS)-reveal a similar pattern of effects. The combination of high temporal diversity and high temporal differentiation (temporal TMS) as well as the combination of low temporal diversity and high temporal homogeneity (STC) proved detrimental to team performance. Rather, team performance was higher when high temporal diversity was balanced with team organizing mechanisms emphasizing homogeneity. To illustrate, high variability on polychronicity when combined with low STC in <ref type="figure" coords="11,316.24,423.83,31.23,8.10">Figure 1</ref> or high temporal TMS in <ref type="figure" coords="11,447.88,423.83,31.23,8.10" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> decreased performance. In contrast, high polychronicity diversity and high STC in <ref type="figure" coords="11,306.00,446.22,30.45,8.10">Figure 1</ref> and low polychronicity diversity and high temporal TMS in <ref type="figure" coords="11,315.90,457.41,30.90,8.10" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> increased performance. With the benefit of hindsight, optimal distinctiveness theory <ref type="bibr" coords="11,420.16,468.61,56.28,8.10" target="#b18">(Brewer, 1991)</ref> provides a framework for understanding the benefits of including both unifying and diversifying elements in teams. According to <ref type="bibr" coords="11,471.04,490.99,51.37,8.10" target="#b18">Brewer (1991)</ref>, team members actively endeavor to obtain an optimal balance of assimilation and differentiation within teams and will take corrective action to avoid being too similar (through reasserting distinctiveness) or too unique (through reasserting inclusion; <ref type="bibr" coords="11,508.97,535.77,37.07,8.10;11,306.00,546.96,51.10,8.10" target="#b81">Pickett &amp; Brewer, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,315.00,558.15,66.13,8.10" target="#b26">Eisenhardt (2004)</ref> argued, consistent with optimal distinctiveness theory, that team outcomes will be more favorable when temporal diversity is matched with process homogeneity. Because temporal composition is a given for members, adjustments to process issues such as scheduling may be key to achieving an optimum temporal balance in teams. Teams with high temporal diversity could instill homogenizing temporal mechanisms (high STC and low temporal TMS), whereas teams with low temporal diversity could emphasize differentiation mechanisms (low STC and high temporal TMS) to attain temporal optimality and increase performance. Although this possibility is consistent with the pattern of moderating effects we found in our study, we acknowledge that future research is needed to provide a direct test the tenets of optimal distinctiveness theory for polychronicity diversity and temporal team cognition.

In the case of the former, because most individuals would fully concentrate on their own particular task, important responsibilities could fall through the cracks. A temporal TMS would help prevent gaps and blind spots in the collective workflow by allocating specific tasks to the right person at the right point in time. In the case of mostly polychronic members, the likelihood of duplication of effort and wasted resources is high when multiple individuals are working on multiple tasks simultaneously. Consequently, a temporal TMS would coordinate when expertise is needed in the project cycle to streamline task progress and avoid redundancy.</p><p>Whereas there is a growing body of research showing that TMS positively affects team performance <ref type="bibr" coords="12,195.88,241.85,92.18,8.10;12,48.00,252.85,52.69,8.10" target="#b25">(DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010)</ref>, scholars have recognized that rigidity in members' knowledge and the loss of information through incorrect assignment or lack of member recall may result in adverse TMS effects <ref type="bibr" coords="12,48.00,285.85,170.98,8.10" target="#b43">(Hollingshead, Gupta, Yoon, &amp; Brandon, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,221.08,285.85,66.94,8.10;12,48.00,296.85,19.37,8.10" target="#b57">Lewis &amp; Herndon, 2011)</ref>.

Our results complement this nascent research by suggesting that the adverse effects of temporal TMS occur when team polychronicity diversity is higher rather than when it is lower. The tendency of diverse members to avoid those who manage their time differently may interfere with intrateam communication, resulting in misrepresentations of when member expertise is needed and errors in temporal TMS that hamper performance. In contrast, homogeneity in polychronicity may facilitate effective communication and allow members to accurately estimate member expertise and effectively coordinate activities, resulting in superior team performance.

Admittedly, however, our measure of a temporal TMS was limited to knowledge representation and excluded the process mechanisms by which group members encode, store, and retrieve information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="12,216.98,670.85,54.90,8.10" target="#b102">Wegner, 1987)</ref>. In addition, there is some inevitable overlap between the general and temporal TMS measures, and further research beyond this study is needed to differentiate the two constructs. Also, although the mechanism is implied in our theorization of the positive and negative effects of polychronicity diversity on team performance, we did not explicitly test the possible mediators in the diversityperformance link. Future studies should explicitly test the mechanisms under which STC maximizes beneficial aspects (e.g., coordinated action,  or minimizes adverse effects (e.g., conflict resolution, <ref type="bibr" coords="12,460.99,132.48,85.06,8.10;12,306.00,143.60,21.00,8.10" target="#b65">Mohammed &amp; Angell, 2004)</ref> of polychronicity diversity in teams.</p><p>At this stage of the nascent work on polychronicity in teams, we chose to focus solely on the bottom-up or emergent aspects of how individual-level polychronicity affects team performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Our study informs managers about a new a form of diversity operating in teams as well as ways to effectively manage polychronicity diversity in multiproject and client-driven environments. By showing that polychronicity diversity matters for team performance, our study alerts managers to consider differences in employees' preferences to work simultaneously or sequentially in forming teams and in monitoring team progress. Although polychronicity diversity can be a disruptive influence in teams, results revealed that shared temporal cognition mitigated the negative effects of polychronicity diversity on performance. Thus, an important implication is to encourage team members to reach agreement about temporal milestones and scheduling. Explicitly discussing expectations regarding deadlines and pacing as part of the development of a team charter (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="12,452.76,535.65,89.07,8.10" target="#b62">Mathieu &amp; Rapp, 2009</ref>) would help to formalize and structure this dialogue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validation of Temporal Transactive Memory Systems (TMS) Scale</head><p>We validated the temporal TMS scale in a separate study of 189 working managers from an executive education program at a major eastern university. The participants were assigned to 56 teams in a strategic management course. Each team was required to write a business plan. As expected, the overlap between the temporal TMS scale and the original TMS scale was high but not high enough to suggest redundancy (r ϭ .54 at the individual level and r ϭ .57 at the team level).</p><p>To create a more favorable ratio of indicators to sample size, we used three parcels for temporal TMS and three parcels for original TMS (one each for specialization, credibility, and coordination; <ref type="bibr" coords="17,48.00,239.35,100.84,8.10" target="#b104">Williams &amp; O'Boyle, 2008)</ref> in confirmatory factor analyses (CFA, LISREL; <ref type="bibr" coords="17,84.70,250.35,100.21,8.10" target="#b48">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2004)</ref>. The two-factor model for temporal TMS and original TMS fit the data well ( 2 ϭ 187.19, df ϭ 8; CFI ϭ .94, GFI ϭ .92, nonnormed fit index [NNFI] ϭ .92; RMSEA ϭ .047).Furthermore, the fit of the two-factor model was superior to that of a one-factor model ( 2 ϭ 275.87, df ϭ 9; CFI ϭ .78, GFI ϭ .65, NNFI ϭ .71; RMSEA ϭ .31), as confirmed by a chi-square difference test (⌬ 2 (df ϭ 1) ϭ 88.68, p Ͻ .01). Interfactor correlations between the temporal TMS and original TMS scales were .51 (p Ͻ 0.001) at the individual level and .48 (p Ͻ 0.001) at the team level.</p><p>We examined the convergent and discriminant validity of the temporal TMS scale by linking it to four team correlates: temporal coordination (three items, <ref type="bibr" coords="17,143.12,382.35,83.00,8.10" target="#b46">Janicik &amp; Bartel, 2003)</ref>, deadline adherence (two items, ), workload sharing (three items, <ref type="bibr" coords="17,130.29,404.35,136.53,8.10" target="#b19">Campion, Medsker, &amp; Higgs, 1993)</ref>, and familiarity (one item for each team member, adapted from <ref type="bibr" coords="17,264.31,415.35,23.75,8.10;17,48.00,426.35,136.57,8.10" target="#b41">Hinds, Carley, Krackhardt, &amp; Wholey, 2000)</ref>. Conceptually, both temporal coordination and deadline adherence capture explicitly timebased phenomena in teams (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="17,168.63,448.35,83.56,8.10" target="#b46">Janicik &amp; Bartel, 2003)</ref>, whereas workload sharing and familiarity have been found to relate posi-tively to TMS in prior studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="17,438.16,118.35,107.88,8.10;17,306.00,129.73,70.84,8.10" target="#b1">Akgün, Byrne, Keskin, Lynn, &amp; Imamoglu, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,378.89,129.73,167.16,8.10;17,306.00,141.10,19.37,8.10" target="#b58">Littlepage, Hollingshead, Drake, &amp; Littlepage, 2008)</ref>. Therefore, we expected and found that temporal TMS would have a stronger positive relationship with temporal coordination (individual level: r ϭ 0.37, p Ͻ 0.001, team level: r ϭ0.45, p Ͻ 0.001) than would the original TMS scale (individual level: r ϭ 0.19, p Ͻ 0.05; team level: r ϭ 0.18, p Ͻ 0.05). The correlations were significantly different for both individual-level analyses (Z ϭ 2.69, p Ͻ .01) and team-level analyses (Z ϭ 2.27, p Ͻ .05; <ref type="bibr" coords="17,518.29,220.72,27.75,8.10;17,306.00,232.08,19.37,8.10" target="#b92">Steiger, 1980)</ref>. Similarly, temporal TMS had a stronger positive relationship with deadline adherence (individual level: r ϭ 0.41, p Ͻ0.001; team level: r ϭ 0.43, p Ͻ 0.001) than did the original TMS scale (individual level: r ϭ 0.19, p Ͻ 0.10; team level: r ϭ 0.14, p Ͻ 0.10) at the individual level (Z ϭ 3.32, p Ͻ .01) and team level (Z ϭ 2.40, p Ͻ .05). In contrast, as expected, the original TMS scale (r ϭ 0.39, p Ͻ 0.001) related more strongly with familiarity than did the temporal TMS scale (r ϭ 0.14, p Ͻ 0.10) at the individual level (Z ϭ 3.72, p Ͻ .01). Parallel findings were obtained for the team level of analysis (r ϭ 0.44, p Ͻ 0.001; r ϭ 0.12, n.s., respectively; Z ϭ 2.65, p Ͻ .05). Likewise, the original TMS scale (individual level: r ϭ 0.40, p Ͻ 0.001; team level: r ϭ 0.40, p Ͻ 0.001) was more strongly correlated with workload sharing than was temporal TMS (individual level: r ϭ 0.14, p Ͻ 0.10; team level: r ϭ 0.11, n.s.) at the individual level (Z ϭ 3.88, p Ͻ .01) and team level (Z ϭ2.37, p Ͻ .05). Finally, temporal TMS explained 17% additional unique variance (␤ ϭ 0.29, p Ͻ 0.01; ⌬R 2 ϭ 0.17, p Ͻ 0.01) in team performance beyond that explained by the original TMS scale and team size (␤ ϭ 0.30 and ␤ ϭ 0.22, p Ͻ 0.05, respectively; R 2 ϭ 0.23, p Ͻ 0.01).</p></div>
