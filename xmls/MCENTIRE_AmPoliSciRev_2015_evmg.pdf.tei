We tested their efficacy using an experimental research design in which participants were randomly assigned to the control group (shown no campaign materials) or one of the treatment groups shown a campaign against sleep deprivation featuring one of these framing strategies. We then surveyed participants regarding their attitudes and their willingness to act. Results demonstrate that all three framing strategies are more effective at mobilizing consensus than action.

They leverage information regarding human rights abuses into changes in behavior by naming perpetrators of rights violations, and shaming other members of the international community into acting to change the perpetrators' behavior.

However, not all HRO campaigns are successful, and in some cases they may have deleterious effects on human rights outcomes <ref type="bibr" coords="1,424.61,310.08,74.28,9.21" target="#b11">(Carpenter 2005)</ref>. A detailed understanding of how to improve HRO efforts to shape human rights practices should therefore be of paramount importance to political scientists. Yet, the mechanism by which HROs generate the pressure necessary to convince states or international organizations to shame and sanction perpetrators is often assumed, and as a result is undertheorized and unexamined. We need to unpack the naming and shaming process that has previously been "black-boxed," and peer inside at how HROs convert information about rights abuses into action against abusers. Without such examination, our understanding of the impact of HROs in world politics is incomplete.</p><p>HRO micromobilization efforts work to mobilize consensus about the nature of rights abuses and then mobilize action to change rights behavior. 1 They do this by attempting to shape individuals' values on such contentious issues as the use of sleep deprivation as a method of interrogation and mobilizing them to act on their values. While much has been written describing this process of framing-"conscious strategic efforts . . . to fashion shared understandings of the world and of themselves that legitimize and motivate collective action" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,336.65,573.10,126.36,9.21">(Keck and Sikkink 1998, 3)</ref>-as vital to advocacy efforts in general and human rights advocacy work specifically, little systematic research has been done evaluating the efficacy of framing on opinion or behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="1,341.53,616.94,129.14,9.21">(Benford and Snow 2000, 632)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we begin to address these critical gaps in our understanding of how advocacy groups mobilize Human Rights Organizations as Agents of Change August 2015 opinion and action to affect policy change. Using an experimental research design we test the efficacy of the three framing strategies most frequently used by large, international, Western-based HROs. How HROs relay information about human rights abuses, and how that information is received, may affect how able they are to mobilize consensus and action to change states' human rights behavior. Therefore, our examination of HRO effectiveness begins at the individual level, examining international HRO efforts at micromobilization. Our results speak to the utility of the most common framing techniques in fostering consensus about the nature and severity of human rights violations (consensus mobilization), and the willingness of individuals exposed to those frames to mobilize to change them (action mobilization).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HROs and the Mobilization of Consensus and Action</head><p>HROs-the specific type of NGOs focused on human rights issues-gather information that states do not want to be available to the public. Perpetrators of human rights abuses generally prefer to avoid the spotlight so as to be able to continue these practices without scrutiny by global or local audiences. They also wish to avoid being labeled as norm violators, particularly if this results in suffering consequences for their actions. An HRO's power lies in the information it possesses about these abuses, and how it uses that information to mobilize consensus that an issue is a human rights issue, and to mobilize action to address it <ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.16,436.31,59.10,9.21" target="#b1">(Becker 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,59.16,447.27,101.26,9.21" target="#b35">Keck and Sikkink 1998)</ref>.</p><p>HROs mobilize consensus by spotlighting a rights abuse, and making others perceive that action as an abuse and the perpetrator as an abuser of human rights.

However, some important studies have found that HROs are strategic actors, and that sometimes their efforts can be problematic <ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.14,633.57,22.14,9.21;2,59.16,644.53,22.40,9.21" target="#b6">(Bob 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,84.47,644.53,65.10,9.21" target="#b11">Carpenter 2005</ref>; Hafner-Burton 2008). The contrast in findings suggests that analyzing differences in human rights campaigns may yield insight into differences in HRO effectiveness in changing human rights outcomes.</p><p>Although much of the literature has focused on how HROs mobilize consensus and action of elites on the global stage, none of that is possible without micromo-bilization efforts. HROs mobilize individuals directly, or assist local groups in mobilizing, to pressure targets to change their human rights practices <ref type="bibr" coords="2,498.16,74.16,45.18,9.21;2,310.22,85.13,58.58,9.21" target="#b35">(Keck and Sikkink 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,371.76,85.13,108.80,9.21" target="#b49">Murdie and Bhasin 2011)</ref>. For instance, HRO campaigns spotlighting the practice of manufacturing clothes in sweatshop conditions or with child labor have successfully convinced concerned citizens to view these issues as rights violations, and have triggered the mobilization of consumer boycotts. In turn, these actions have forced multinational corporations and host states to alter their labor practices <ref type="bibr" coords="2,511.80,161.84,31.54,9.21;2,310.22,172.79,84.20,9.21" target="#b20">(Elliott and Freeman 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,398.11,172.79,53.80,9.21" target="#b29">Hertel 2006)</ref>. Similarly, Amnesty International's (AI) Urgent Action campaigns encourage citizen activists to identify an issue as a human rights violation, and to act on it by communicating directly with target governments to urge them to change their behavior. Governments previously able to act in the shadows are besieged with messages from people around the world, making it clear that rights violations no longer go unseen <ref type="bibr" coords="2,428.96,260.47,114.36,9.21" target="#b28">(Hendrix and Wong 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,310.22,271.42,50.77,9.21" target="#b74">Wong 2012)</ref>. HRO efforts at educating local populations about human rights issues yield greater appreciation for the human rights environment and a better understanding of governments' failures to protect such rights <ref type="bibr" coords="2,338.92,315.26,82.73,9.21" target="#b15">(Davis et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,426.00,315.26,53.16,9.21" target="#b72">Welch 1995)</ref>. This enables HROs to mobilize citizens to educate lawmakers about the nature and extent of the issues, and attempt to change their political calculus and behavior.</p><p>Scholars have noted the far-reaching success of this tactic, from the campaign to end chattel slavery in Great Britain in the 19th century <ref type="bibr" coords="2,449.16,381.02,54.51,9.21" target="#b74">(Wong 2012)</ref> to the recent campaign in California to abolish sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders <ref type="bibr" coords="2,478.33,402.94,60.62,9.21" target="#b1">(Becker 2012)</ref>. However, these successes are only possible if HROs are able to convince citizens that a given issue is a human rights issue, and to subsequently take action to change the situation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,366.12,446.78,75.85,9.21" target="#b15">(Davis et al. 2012)</ref>. To accomplish both of these tasks, HROs engage in framing. Despite its centrality to HRO activities, to our knowledge, there are no studies in the academic literature 2 or within the advocacy community that explicitly examine under what conditions framing is effective as a tool to build consensus and action mobilization on human rights issues. In conversations with key figures in international HROs such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Catholic Relief Services, advocacy professionals routinely noted that HROs would love to know what type(s) of framing works, both to design more effective campaigns and to justify efforts and expenditures to funders, but do not have the resources to examine the relative effects of these efforts. We contribute to this gap in the academic literature and in the knowledge base of practitioners by analyzing which framing strategies are most effective at aligning citizen views about human rights issues with that of the organization, and which are most effective at mobilizing citizens to act.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Use of Frames to Mobilize Consensus and Action</head><p>Frames are the rhetorical lenses or "schemata of interpretation" that help actors construct the way in which issues are likely to be viewed or understood <ref type="bibr" coords="3,255.22,107.47,23.05,9.21;3,49.76,118.43,59.28,9.21">(Goffman 1974, 21)</ref>. There are many frames through which individuals can view a given issue or situation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,257.96,129.39,19.92,9.21;3,49.76,140.34,87.35,9.21" target="#b3">(Benford and Snow 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,139.40,140.34,120.06,9.21" target="#b12">Chong and Druckman 2007)</ref>.

Framing is the process by which some actor constructs a particular perception of reality about that issue by causing individuals to "develop a particular conceptualization of an issue or reorient their thinking about an issue" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,93.93,238.97,145.98,9.21">(Chong and Druckman 2007, 104</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" coords="3,49.76,249.94,64.19,9.21" target="#b22">Goffman 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,116.46,249.94,101.90,9.21" target="#b52">Nelson and Oxley 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Framing is a particularly effective way for political entrepreneurs to influence individuals as they consider information about sociopolitical issues.

Frames have even been found to "influence how citizens explain their thoughts about an issue in their own words" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,83.27,359.53,80.41,9.21">(Brewer 2002, 304)</ref>.</p><p>Transnational advocacy networks, like other social movements and their component organizations, must frame issues to "make them comprehensible to target audiences, to attract attention and encourage action" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,49.77,414.32,122.21,9.21">(Keck and Sikkink 1999, 90)</ref>. Movements and organizations actively engage in the framing of social problems to bring individuals' views on the issues at hand in line with their own, a process known as consensus mobilization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,121.65,458.15,86.07,9.21" target="#b38">(Klandermans 1984)</ref>. Since consensus mobilization is necessary for movement participation, the ability to effectively employ frames plays a significant part in action mobilization and the ability to shape public policy <ref type="bibr" coords="3,133.32,501.99,64.87,9.21" target="#b21">(Gamson 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,200.28,501.99,82.60,9.21" target="#b38">Klandermans 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,49.77,512.95,72.83,9.21" target="#b67">Snow et al. 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,125.32,512.95,108.33,9.21" target="#b66">Snow and Benford, 1992)</ref>.

For example, the voter mobilization literature suggests that an individual is more likely to vote when he or she perceives his or her vote as instrumental to affecting the outcome, when the costs of voting are minimal, and when the psychic benefits of participation are high <ref type="bibr" coords="3,49.77,655.41,108.46,9.21" target="#b18">(Duffy and Tavits, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.63,655.41,115.88,9.21" target="#b63">Sigelman and Berry 1982)</ref>. The latter includes complying with and reiterating social norms about participation, and gaining a sense of efficacy and importance through being able to express one's preference <ref type="bibr" coords="3,150.74,699.25,127.77,9.21" target="#b60">(Riker and Ordeshook, 1968)</ref>. In short, different frames tap into different elements that may be critical to one's decision to participate po-litically, such as lowered costs of participating, greater feelings of empathy, or an increased sense of efficacy and agency. It is to these themes that we now turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE EXPECTED EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FRAMES</head><p>In order to determine which frames are used most frequently by large, international, Western-based HROs, we conducted field work in the Amnesty International USA (AI-USA) archives at Columbia University, which houses all of the institutional materials of AI-USA. 3 A sample of over 3,000 photos of their promotional and advocacy materials was collected and analyzed to gather information on the frames employed by AI to influence citizens' attitudes and behavior.</p><p>The most common frames employed by AI in these documents were (1) informational frames, where the focus is to educate the reader by presenting them with facts and statistics; (2) personal frames, where a personal narrative is told with the aim of emotionally impacting the reader, and creating a sense of empathy for the aggrieved; and (3) motivational frames, which emphasize the reader's agency and potential efficacy, and include a direct appeal to take action. Informational frames were the most common, appearing in all of the campaign materials reviewed. This makes sense in that most campaign ads, regardless of other framing techniques, will present some basic information on the issue at stake. Personal and motivational frames were employed in 77 and 70 percent of the AI campaigns, respectively. As one can infer, AI often used all three framing strategies together in the same campaign ad.</p><p>We also examined recent campaign materials from Physicians for Human Rights and Oxfam International, and had conversations with advocates at Human Rights Watch, Catholic Relief Services, American Jewish World Service, and Doctors without Borders, confirming that other large, Western-based HROs also most regularly employ these three frames in their efforts to mobilize consensus and action. Given their prevalence, our study focuses on understanding the effectiveness of informational, personal and motivational frames. In the following section, we discuss each frame, how and why they are typically used and how they are likely to impact individuals' opinions and actions regarding human rights.</p></div>

Therefore, we hypothesize:</p><p>H7: Exposure to motivational frames during an HRO campaign will increase individuals' self-reported and observed willingness to mobilize around the campaign issue.</p><p>Because motivational frames explicitly work by increasing individuals' sense of personal agency, we hypothesize:</p><p>H8: Exposure to motivational frames during an HRO campaign will increase individuals' reported level of agency.</p><p>Although these direct appeals for action on their own may successfully mobilize individuals in get out the vote or blood drive campaigns, where the issue is already so thoroughly contextualized and its importance imbedded in public discourse as to not require additional justification, we do not expect this to necessarily transfer to such contested issues as human rights. Because motivational frames do not contain detailed information about the issue, nor do they present personal narratives to humanize the victims, we hypothesize:</p><p>H9: Exposure to motivational frames during an HRO campaign will have no impact on alignment between individuals' and the HRO's opinions regarding the campaign issue.</p><p>The hypotheses above address two central research questions: First, are informational, personal, and motivational frames effective at mobilizing consensus and action on human rights issues? Are individuals who see human rights campaigns featuring one of these framing strategies more likely to agree that a violation has occurred, and subsequently more likely to get involved in a campaign to end the practice? Second, if they are effective, what is the mechanism through which these frames change individuals' beliefs and actions?</p><p>However, a third question remains-which of these commonly used framing strategies is most effective? Knowing which technique is most likely to yield the greatest effects is of paramount importance for HROs facing significant resource constraints. It is not surprising that motivational frames are so important in voter mobilization campaigns, as much of what we know about voting suggests how central an individual's calculation about her or his impact is to their decision. Yet this logic does not work as well in application to human rights activism, where most theorizing suggests the importance of empathy and emotional reaction in mobilizing consensus and action. Similarly, information about human rights abuses may be important in spurring mobilization, but we believe it is not sufficient. Facts alone should do less to make others focus on the problem as central and in need of their action than efforts that help people identify with other humans in distress.</p><p>We argue that there is an inherent fit between human rights issues and personal frames. By definition, human rights focus on those rights or freedoms that are necessary to preserving the basic humanity of all persons. Empathy generated by personal narratives about the humanity of others was crucial to the development and diffusion of the very idea of human rights <ref type="bibr" coords="6,237.28,633.57,50.61,9.21" target="#b31">(Hunt 2007)</ref>, as well as altruism inherent in the willingness to act on behalf of the suffering of others <ref type="bibr" coords="6,223.11,655.49,64.77,9.21" target="#b47">(Monroe 1996)</ref>. Personal frames remind the audience of the inalienability of these rights by humanizing the subject and connecting the audience to him or her. They should elicit strong emotional reactions based on a connection formed from a sense of a common humanity, and the recognition of the inhumanity of rights abuses. This, in turn, should yield both consensus and action mobilization. Therefore, we hypothesize:</p><p>H10: Exposure to personal frames during an HRO campaign will have a greater impact on alignment between individuals' and the HRO's opinions regarding the campaign issue than exposure to informational or motivational frames.</p><p>H11: Exposure to personal frames during an HRO campaign will have a greater impact on self-reported and observed willingness to mobilize around the campaign issue than exposure to informational or motivational frames. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS AND DATA</head><p>To test these hypotheses, we designed an experiment wherein a fictitious human rights organization, The Human Rights Initiative, launched four campaigns on the use of sleep deprivation during police interrogations. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform, we recruited 826 survey respondents. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups representing each of the different HRO frames, or a control group that was not exposed to a frame. The treatment groups were each shown the corresponding ad campaign about sleep deprivation as an interrogation technique, after which they were asked a series of questions about their attitudes on the issue. The control group was shown no ad campaign and was taken directly to the survey.</p><p>We chose the Human Rights Initiative as our institutional front to provide a perceived level of legitimacy to the campaign. The Human Rights Initiative shares its name with a few academic programs, but is distinct from the largest and most well known HROs. As such, it is unlikely that participants in the study would recognize the name or carry any preformed ideas regarding the group's work. This anonymity is essential in order to avoid any effect an organization's reputation may have on individuals' opinions and actions, thus allowing us to isolate the independent impact of each frame. 7 Similarly, the design of the logo was driven by our concerns to create an HRO campaign that appeared official, while avoiding the introduction of any potentially biasing element. The dove, olive branches, and open palm are commonly associated with the human rights community, but should not conjure memories of any particular HRO.

H11 Exposure to personal frames during an HRO campaign will have a greater impact on individuals' self-reported and observed willingness to mobilize around the campaign issue than exposure to informational or motivational frames Even among those individuals who are sensitized to human rights issues and predisposed to mobilize in their defense, given limited time and resources, there may be a greater willingness to get involved when the violation is perceived as particularly egregious. Focusing on the "lesser" offense of sleep deprivation represents a hard test of our mobilizing strategies. There is considerable variation in Americans' attitudes regarding the acceptability of sleep deprivation in comparison to more "serious" violations. In a recent survey, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,68.92,512.96,92.85,9.21" target="#b59">Richards et al. (2012)</ref> find that "leaves no marks" interrogation techniques, including sleep deprivation, hooding, and verbal assaults, are more widely accepted than techniques employing direct physical violence (80-81). Fifty-six percent of respondents found sleep deprivation an acceptable interrogation technique in some cases; only 44 percent found it unacceptable in all cases <ref type="bibr" coords="7,87.93,589.67,106.85,9.21">(Richards et al. 2012, 80)</ref>. In an earlier study, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,49.76,600.63,87.75,9.21" target="#b24">Gronke et al. (2010)</ref> found that, of all possible torture techniques asked about in U.S. public opinion polls, sleep deprivation garnered the greatest amount of support (65%), while only 35% of respondents opposed its use. Therefore, we can assume that before viewing our human rights campaign many participants may believe sleep deprivation to be an appropriate interrogation tool.</p><p>Last, because the context of the narrative could greatly impact individuals' attitudes and behavior, we carefully constructed the violation to occur during a "peacetime" civilian police interrogation to avoid any explicit connection to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the subsequent "Global War on Terror," or the events of any particular country.</p><p>The campaigns were then distributed to participants who, after reading the campaign ad, were surveyed regarding their attitudes and potential participation in an anti-sleep-deprivation effort.

Those in the treatment groups were directed to a second page, where they were asked to read the relevant campaign message before proceeding to the questionnaire. Those in the control group received no campaign message and were taken directly to the questionnaire. 11 The informational, personal, and motivational campaigns are shown in <ref type="figure" coords="8,248.09,609.04,44.19,9.21;8,59.16,619.99,4.98,9.21">Figures 1-3</ref> below. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,95.50,618.44,6.97,6.44">12</ref> We consulted AI-USA's historical archive of advocacy materials, as well as more recent campaign materials from Amnesty International, Physicians for Human Rights, and Oxfam International to ensure that the language, style, and tone of the treatments was comparable to that which individuals would actually be exposed to during an HRO campaign. We also made sure that the basic content was similar across all four treatments; each frame identified sleep deprivation as ineffective, inhumane, and occurring in the context of police interrogation.

We suspected that the characteristics of MTurkers more generally, and of our sample specifically, matched quite well the target demographic for HRO advocacy materials, particularly large, Western-based HROs. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,275.42,504.66,6.97,6.44">13</ref> To verify this, we spoke with individuals at the AI-USA main office and regional offices, Human Rights Watch, Doctors without Borders, Catholic Relief Services, American Jewish World Service, and Abolition Ohio who play key roles in their organizations' advocacy efforts. Most suggested that while they attempt to target a broad and representative cross section of the entire population, they are most likely to reach people that fit the profile described above. One interviewee at a major international HRO indicated that this is due in part to the lists of people that HROs purchase, which come predominantly from sources such as magazines that tend to target this demographic (Anonymous 13 While many international HROs cover abusive practices in less developed countries, the target audience for consensus and action mobilization is often not the population where those abuses are occurring, but rather the citizens of the global North. Given this, it is likely that the audience's education level is not significantly different from that reported by our respondents. 2013). As a result, the sampling frame that HROs use to generate a mailing list is itself already skewed younger, more liberal, and better educated, leading to a slightly biased sample. Another interviewee suggested that the increasing use of the internet to mobilize consensus and action makes those they target for advocacy appeals more like the demographic of MTurkers and less like the demographic of the typical rank-and-file members of the organization (O'Keefe 2013).</p><p>In sum, MTurk generates samples that may not be nationally representative, but are highly representative of the population targeted by HROs. This makes MTurk an ideal tool for experimental studies examining the effects of HRO framing. We are confident that our sample is likely more representative of the typical target of HRO advocacy efforts than would be a more traditional random sample, or any other convenience sample.</p><p>We use ordered logit to analyze our data because the dependent variables are not continuous, but rather ordinal (or dichotomous in the case of the direct measures of action mobilization).

We also report the predicted probabilities to capture the substantive impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we present the results from our analyses, testing the impact of various messaging techniques on individuals' perceptions and actions on the issue of sleep deprivation. We find that the three most a We also examined the impact of each treatment independently on the dependent variables in bivariate (excluding all control variables) and multivariate (including all control variables) models. The results from the multivariate analyses are essentially the same as those presented here. The bivariate models confirm our general conclusion that the personal frames are more effective than informational and motivational frames at mobilizing consensus and action on human rights issues. However, while exposure to the male or female personal frame increases respondents' willingness to reject of the use of sleep deprivation, in the bivariate models, only the personal-male frame increases their likelihood to sign a petition to ban the practice (p &lt; 0.05). Notes: Two-tailed tests; robust standard errors in parentheses; * = p &lt; 0.05; * * = p &lt; 0.01; * * * = p &lt; 0.001. common messaging techniques employed by HROsinformational, personal, and motivational frames-are more effective at fostering consensus mobilization than action mobilization. Personal narratives appear to be the most consistently successful, increasing individuals' knowledge of and emotional reaction to the issue, and as a consequence, leading them to reject the practice and participate in a campaign to demand its cessation. Model 1 examines the effect that exposure to one of the treatments has on a participant's agreement with the use of sleep deprivation. Results from the regression analysis <ref type="table" coords="12,145.42,555.41,39.14,9.21" target="#tab_4">(Table 4)</ref> show that compared to the control group, exposure to any of the treatmentsinformational, personal, or motivational-significantly decreases one's likelihood of viewing sleep deprivation as an appropriate police interrogation technique. For example, reading a personal narrative of a male survivor of sleep deprivation results in a 1.39 unit decrease in the log odds of reporting a higher level of agreement with the use of sleep deprivation. As the log odds is not always an intuitive way to interpret logit coefficients, we use them to generate predicted probabilities for hypothetical cases of interest. <ref type="table" coords="12,69.12,686.92,31.39,9.21" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> depicts the predicted probabilities of how one might respond to the question of whether sleep deprivation is an appropriate interrogation technique, given their exposure to each of the treatments. The first column indicates the probabilities predicted for respondents in the control group who did not see the text of an advocacy campaign. Each subsequent column shows predicted probabilities for respondents viewing each of the treatments. We can compare, for example, the predicted probability that someone in the control group will strongly disagree with that statement (0.2231) to the probability of strongly disagreeing if they viewed the informational frame (0.4010), either of the personal frames (0.5347 [male]; 0.5053 [female]) or the motivational frame (0.3085). We can make similar comparisons across each of the rows.</p><p>The probability that someone in the control group will neither agree nor disagree with the use of sleep deprivation is 0.2386. The predicted probability of disagreeing in some manner is 0.5793 (the sum of predicted probabilities for both disagreeing and strongly disagreeing), while the probability that the respondent will agree in some manner is 0.1821 (the sum of predicted probabilities for both agreeing and strongly agreeing).</p><p>All of the treatments have measurable effects on the probability that a respondent will find sleep deprivation an inappropriate interrogation technique. However, exposure to the personal frames has the most dramatic effect; when compared to the control group, the probability of disagreeing with the use of sleep deprivation increases by 0.2671 if the respondent sees the personal-male frame, and by 0.2512 if the respondent sees the personal-female frame. When making similar comparisons, the probability of disagreeing with the use of sleep deprivation increases by only 0.1832 if the respondent sees the informational frame, and 0.1022 if the respondent sees the motivational frame. Although all of the frames have a statistically significant effect on respondents' opinions that sleep deprivation is inappropriate <ref type="table" coords="13,149.64,450.97,37.85,9.21" target="#tab_4">(Table 4)</ref>, the magnitude of the impact of personal frames on consensus mobilization is greatest <ref type="table" coords="13,97.15,472.88,37.85,9.21" target="#tab_5">(Table 5)</ref>. That the various treatments had differential effects on the dependent variable (H10) is confirmed through a series of Wald tests <ref type="bibr" coords="13,236.20,494.80,46.68,9.21;13,49.76,505.76,53.55,9.21" target="#b44">(Long and Freese 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,106.07,505.76,62.46,9.21" target="#b73">Williams 2014)</ref>. 14 In fact, only the effects of the personal-male and personal-female treatments were indistinguishable from one another. As an illustrative example, <ref type="figure" coords="13,124.48,538.64,35.34,9.21" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> graphs the predicted probability of an individual strongly disagreeing with the statement "Sleep deprivation is an appropriate police interrogation technique." We can see that respondents who view one of the treatments are more likely to find sleep deprivation inappropriate than are those who view no treatment. In addition, both personal frames are more likely to lead to consensus mobilization than the motivational frame, and somewhat less conclusively, the informational frame. no significant difference in the impact between the personal-male and personal-female frames. Models 2-5 in <ref type="table" coords="13,373.72,374.26,31.40,9.21" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> examine the effect that exposure to one of the treatments has on a participant's selfreported and observed willingness to mobilize around the issue of sleep deprivation. With one exception, participants who viewed any of the treatments were more likely than those who did not to report that they would both support and participate in a campaign to ban sleep deprivation (Models 2 and 3). 15 However, when asked to actually take action by signing a petition to be sent to the Attorney General or the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, only those exposed to the personal frames were more likely to do so. Neither the informational nor the motivational frames had a statistically significant effect on participants' actual choices to act or not (Models 4 and 5). Given the relatively low risk and low cost request ("If you would like to add your name to a petition to be sent to . . . , demanding the immediate end to the use of sleep deprivation during police interrogation, please click YES below"), we are not optimistic about the prospects of either the informational, or somewhat more unexpectedly, the motivational frames on their own to mobilize individuals around an issue area.</p><p>Tables 6 and 7 investigate the magnitude of the effects of these treatments on action mobilization. The difference in predicted probabilities of agreeing to add one's name to a petition to be sent to the Attorney General <ref type="table" coords="13,319.86,670.15,34.71,9.21" target="#tab_6">(Table 6</ref>) or the UN Special Rapporteur <ref type="table" coords="13,494.80,670.15,39.15,9.21" target="#tab_7">(Table 7)</ref>    if the respondent sees the personal-male frame, and by 0.1173 if the respondent sees the personal-female frame. A similar effect is seen when examining the predicted probabilities for adding one's name to the Attorney General petition. While it appears that the personal frames have the strongest effect on action mobilization, given the significant overlap in the confidence intervals, and the Wald test statistics, 16 we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the treatments' impacts on the dependent variable (H11). <ref type="table" coords="15,59.72,118.01,31.40,9.21">Table 8</ref> displays the results from Models 6-10, which test the proposed mechanisms driving participants' beliefs and behavior regarding sleep deprivation. Results show that the informational frame is the only messaging strategy that has a consistent impact on individuals' knowledge of the issue. With its emphasis on "objective" facts and statistics, it is not surprising that the informational frame increases participants' perceived and real knowledge of sleep deprivation, including its negative impact on victims/survivors and its overall efficacy as an interrogation technique. In comparison, neither the personal nor the motivational frames left participants feeling more informed, even though both framing strategies increased individuals' likelihood of correctly identifying sleep deprivation as deleterious for victims. The personal-male frame further led participants to correctly identify sleep deprivation as an ineffective interrogation tool.</p><p>Where informational frames attempt to change people's minds and behavior through education, personal frames do so by appealing to their base emotions. The results presented in Models 11-14 in <ref type="table" coords="15,214.85,348.14,31.40,9.21">Table 8</ref> demonstrate that personal frames do, in fact, elicit emotional responses from viewers. Individuals exposed to personal narratives of suffering are more likely than those who are not to feel "bad" or "very bad" when thinking about sleep deprivation, feelings that were driven mostly by their understanding of the suffering it caused to victims.</p><p>Finally, motivational frames attempt to affect peoples' sense of agency and the likelihood that their actions are effective in bringing about change. We saw in Tables 4, 6, and 7 above that while motivational frames change minds, they do not on their own make individuals more likely to act. The results presented in Model 15 in <ref type="table" coords="15,120.86,501.56,31.40,9.21" target="#tab_9">Table 9</ref> may help to explain why. In this model, we remove agency as a control variable and instead make it the dependent variable. We find that none of the frames, motivational frames included, have an effect on respondents' sense of personal efficacy and agency. A sense of agency plays a role in the processes of consensus and action mobilization, but itself is not affected by exposure to any one particular frame, even one that specifically targets that sense of agency. <ref type="bibr" coords="15,49.76,640.41,5.98,5.52">16</ref> The relevant Wald test statistics for signing a petition to the UN Special Representative are Informational = PersonalMale (χ 2 = 1.35, p = 0.2449); Informational = PersonalFemale (χ 2 = 0.84, p = 0.3590); Informational = Motivational (χ 2 = 0.10; p = 0.7510); PersonalMale = PersonalFemale (χ 2 = 0.05, p = 0.8181); Personal-Male = Motivational (χ 2 = 2.17, p = 0.1412); PersonalFemale = Motivational (χ 2 = 1.49, p = 0.2221). The Wald test results are not substantively different if we look at those who are willing to sign a petition to the Attorney General, or those who were willing to sign either petition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This study provides the first systematic test of the efficacy of the three most common framing techniques employed by large, Western, global HROsinformational, personal, and motivational frames. Our results demonstrate that these frames are more effective at fostering consensus mobilization than they are at action mobilization. Personal narratives appear to be the most consistently successful, increasing individuals' knowledge on the issue, their emotional reaction to the issue, and as a consequence, leading them to reject the practice and participate in a campaign to demand its cessation.</p><p>This study also demonstrated that there are clear systematic differences in how individuals respond to the ways in which information about human rights abuses are presented. HROs' efforts to affect individuals' attitudes or behavior on human rights issues are not uniformly successful, but rather depend greatly on the messaging strategy employed. To the extent that these micromobilization efforts-consensus and action mobilization-are critical to their ability to influence state or perpetrator behavior, the results of our study would suggest that HROs should emphasize personal narratives that provoke empathy and other emotional reactions from the target audience. Stirring emotions of empathy, sadness, and even anger appear more effective than simple issue education or motivational appeals at encouraging individuals to see sleep deprivation as a human rights violation and to participate in a movement to ban its practice.</p><p>Given the dearth of empirical research examining the efficacy of framing in HRO campaigns, this field is ripe with future research opportunities. One such opportunity concerns the use of simultaneous frames. This study demonstrated the impact of each framing strategy in isolation. While significant in its own right (we now know that the use of a personal narrative alone is sufficient to mobilize consensus and action on a human rights issue), the reality is that HROs rarely employ these frames separately. Do some combination of frames work better than others? Is the success of one type of frame contingent upon its use in conjunction with another? Do some frames mitigate the effectiveness of others? Future analysis is required to construct more complex, multiframe campaigns and examine how these interactions impact consensus and action mobilization.</p><p>We hope this study moves scholars to ask other questions that would enhance our understanding of how and under what conditions HROs can change behavior. Our study focuses on the types of campaigns commonly used by large, global HROs that target a more educated, Western audience. Future research should examine the ways in which local HROs, cultural contexts, and audiences change the choice of framing strategies or the efficacy of these frames. For example, our study focused on the mobilization of a relatively educated audience (mean = "technical or associate graduate") from the global North. While respondents' education was not a significant predictor of consensus or action Notes: Two-tailed tests; robust standard errors in parentheses; * = p &lt; 0.05; * * = p &lt; 0.01; * * * = p &lt; 0.001. Notes: Two-tailed tests; robust standard errors in parentheses; * = p &lt; 0.05; * * = p &lt; 0.01; * * * = p &lt; 0.001. mobilization, further analysis is required to determine if HRO campaigns targeting a less educated population employ the same framing strategies, and, if so, whether they have the same effect. In some contexts, for example, where information on rights and rights abuses is limited, campaigns with an informational lens may be essential to shaping individuals' attitudes and behavior.</p><p>In addition, future studies should consider whether some framing strategies work better to mobilize consensus and action around some human rights issues (such as sleep deprivation) but not others (such as disappearances), or on behalf of some types of victims (such as those perceived as vulnerable, innocent, or apolitical) but not others (such as those who may be guilty of a crime, are political dissidents, or may be perceived as less vulnerable). And do consensus and action mobilization actually convince states or IOs to shame or sanction perpetrators, or otherwise affect perpetrator behavior? This study suggests that rather than assuming microlevel processes we should begin to explicitly test these relationships and further specify the relationship between HRO advocacy on human rights issues and actual changes in human rights conditions. Finally, our study suggests that scholars and practitioners of citizen engagement and activism more broadly should explicitly examine the effects of framing strategies on consensus and action mobilization. For example, one might expect that the framing strategies that build consensus around issues of human rights will differ from those that mobilize consensus around environmental issues, which might rely less on personal narratives and empathy and more on providing information about environmental impacts. Similarly, get out the vote campaigns that are tied to specific rights related issues (such as marriage equality) might be better served with the use of a personal frame that builds connection and empathy. Still other issues might be best addressed using a framing strategy not identified here, such as a moral or religious frame. Future research would benefit from analyzing framing effects across a range of activists' issues to better understand how and under what circumstances framing changes minds and mobilizes people to engage in political processes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="13,216.50,637.27,66.40,9.21;13,49.76,676.27,233.13,9.01;13,49.76,685.24,233.12,9.01;13,49.76,694.20,233.13,9.02;13,49.76,703.17,233.13,9.01;13,49.76,712.14,233.13,9.01;13,49.76,721.10,127.78,9.02"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Finally, there is14  The relevant Wald test statistics are Informational = Personal-Male (χ 2 = 6.99, p &lt; 0.01); Informational = PersonalFemale (χ 2 = 4.70, p &lt; 0.05); Informational = Motivational (χ 2 = 3.71; p &lt; 0.10); PersonalMale = PersonalFemale (χ 2 = 0.18, p = 0.67); Personal-Male = Motivational (χ 2 = 18.74, p &lt; 0.001); PersonalFemale = Motivational (χ 2 = 14.98, p &lt; 0.001).</figDesc></figure>
