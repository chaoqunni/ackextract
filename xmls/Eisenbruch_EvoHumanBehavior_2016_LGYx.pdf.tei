			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of models to explain human behavior in the ultimatum game, but none can adequately account for all of the available data. Across two studies using a face perception paradigm, we provide evidence that people use evolved, specialized heuristics for long-term cooperative partner choice to calibrate their generosity toward ultimatum game partners. Men and women played one-shot ultimatum games for real incentives with partners represented by face photographs. Men were more generous toward partners who were stronger, and who appeared more attractive, more prosocial, more productive, healthier and higher in social status; the effect of strength was mediated by productivity, but not dangerousness, suggesting that men implemented heuristics designed for partner choice rather than the asymmetric war of attrition. Moreover, men reduced their earnings by cooperating selectively with valuable long-term partners. Women also gave better treatment to valuable-appearing partners, but appeared to prioritize partner choice less than men did, relative to game earnings and intrasexual competition. The results suggest that people treat the ultimatum game as though it were an opportunity to establish a cooperative relationship with a new partner, and implications are discussed for an evolved psychology of cooperative partner choice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Researchers have long used the Ultimatum Game (UG) to study human cooperation and bargaining <ref type="bibr" coords="1,174.84,448.88,60.22,7.54" target="#b37">(Camerer, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,237.43,448.88,56.14,7.54;1,42.52,459.36,19.85,7.54" target="#b48">Güth &amp; Kocher, 2014)</ref>. In the UG, a proposer offers a specific split of a fixed sum of money, and the responder either accepts the offerin which case the proposed split is enactedor rejects it, in which case both players receive nothing. Behavior in the UG is typically regarded as economically "anomalous" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.14,501.20,49.01,7.54" target="#b76">(Thaler, 1988)</ref>, because people fail to pursue the incomemaximizing strategies whereby responders accept any positive offer and prescient proposers therefore make the lowest possible offer. Instead, proposers in industrial societies typically offer 40%-50% of the endowment and responders frequently reject low offers (but see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,265.27,543.04,28.44,7.54;1,42.52,553.47,40.90,7.54" target="#b51">Henrich et al., 2005</ref> regarding cultural differences). To explain these results, economists have developed a variety of models suggesting that people are averse to unequal distributions between the two players (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,53.35,584.88,53.21,7.54" target="#b37">Camerer, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Exogenous to these models, however, is a body of research showing that people are sensitive to the traits of their UG partner, not merely to the structure of the game. For example, offers are more likely to be accepted if they are from a smiling proposer <ref type="bibr" coords="1,200.01,626.72,93.50,7.54;1,42.52,637.21,21.28,7.54" target="#b66">(Mussel, Göritz, &amp; Hewig, 2013)</ref> or one described as generous <ref type="bibr" coords="1,168.43,637.21,125.13,7.54;1,42.52,647.64,20.61,7.54" target="#b59">(Marchetti, Castelli, Harlé, &amp; Sanfey, 2011)</ref>; more symmetrical responders receive higher offers <ref type="bibr" coords="1,262.59,647.64,30.97,7.54;1,42.52,658.13,84.41,7.54" target="#b86">(Zaatari, Palestis, &amp; Trivers, 2009)</ref>; and more attractive individuals receive higher offers from proposers but responders also demand more from them in order to accept an offer <ref type="bibr" coords="1,395.55,448.87,100.73,7.54" target="#b73">(Solnick &amp; Schweitzer, 1999)</ref>. There is complementary evidence from other economic games as well, for example showing that attractive individuals are more likely to be trusted <ref type="bibr" coords="1,310.51,480.28,85.63,7.54" target="#b84">(Wilson &amp; Eckel, 2006)</ref> and to have their trust reciprocated <ref type="bibr" coords="1,533.31,480.28,28.21,7.54;1,310.51,490.71,86.65,7.54" target="#b54">(Krupp, DeBruine, &amp; Jones, 2011)</ref> in a trust game. These results suggest that people process economic games, including the UG, as though they are realworld social interactions, in which the biological and behavioral traits of their partners matter. Since humans have cognitive adaptations for social exchange relationships (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,426.50,532.55,89.08,7.54" target="#b41">Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2005)</ref>, we investigated whether behavior in the UG conforms to evolved heuristics for resource division.</p><p>We identified two adaptationist theories of how resources might be divided in the UG. First, there is evidence suggesting that people divide resources according to the logic of the asymmetric war of attrition (AWA; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,337.32,595.31,106.25,7.54" target="#b49">Hammerstein &amp; Parker, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,445.66,595.31,78.66,7.54" target="#b62">Maynard Smith, 1979)</ref>, in which resources are allocated based on the relative ability and willingness of each individual to inflict damage on the other. Physically stronger men feel more entitled to advantageous outcomes and are more willing to use force to resolve conflicts in their favor <ref type="bibr" coords="1,472.25,637.20,89.38,7.54;1,310.51,647.63,16.61,7.54" target="#b72">(Sell, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides, 2009</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" coords="1,363.51,647.63,174.50,7.54" target="#b69">Petersen, Sznycer, Sell, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 2013)</ref>. If resources are divided in the UG according to the logic of the AWA, then any cues of the likelihood of winning a violent conflict over resources (e.g., strength, aggressiveness) should lead to more advantageous treatment in the game.</p><p>The second theory is that people will treat the UG not as a conflict over an existing resource (in which the AWA would apply), but as an opportunity to initiate a long-term cooperative relationship. Humans evolved in a biological marketplace of long-term cooperative relationships, and therefore faced selection pressures to choose (and be chosen by) the most valuable available cooperators <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.36,87.51,54.60,7.54" target="#b31">(Barclay, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.11,87.51,34.45,7.54;2,32.43,97.95,95.79,7.54" target="#b34">Baumard, André, &amp; Sperber, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,133.11,97.95,102.66,7.54" target="#b67">Noë &amp; Hammerstein, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,235.77,97.95,24.85,7.54" target="#b68">, 1995</ref>. An individual's value in the biological market of cooperators is a function of their ability to create future benefits, their expected generosity in sharing those benefits, and their outside options for production and/or cooperation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,78.97,139.79,56.02,7.54" target="#b31">(Barclay, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.71,139.79,79.61,7.54" target="#b34">Baumard et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,219.96,139.79,63.51,7.54;2,32.43,150.27,19.49,7.54" target="#b87">Zaatari &amp; Trivers, 2007)</ref>. If mechanisms that evolved for partner choice (PC) govern behavior in the UG, then participants should offer advantageous treatment to partners who appear high in partner value, as a type of opening bid for the establishment of a cooperative relationship. On this account, any cues that a potential partner is more valuable than alternative possible partners should cause that potential partner to be treated better in the UG. As discussed further below, cues of health, strength, and prosociality, among other traits, likely predicted relative partner value in the ancestral environments in which PC mechanisms evolved. As such, on the PC model, players perceived to possess these traits should receive more generous treatment in the UG.</p><p>In the present research, we used face photographs that had been measured and rated for various traits as partners in the UG in order to test how perceived traits affect treatment in the game. We initially hypothesized effects consistent with the AWAin which more threatening and formidable individuals should receive better treatmentbut initial results suggested that cues of high partner value might be the stronger predictor of treatment in the game. Subsequent data collections were therefore designed to test between the AWA and PC models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Study 1a: Introduction</head><p>Since humans form rich impressions of others based on limited exposure to faces (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,118.89,411.79,92.42,7.54" target="#b83">Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006)</ref>, we used a faceperception paradigm to test the effects of various cues on treatment in the UG. In an initial study using male participants, we predicted on the basis of the AWA that cues of the likelihood of escalating and winning a violent conflict over resources would lead to more generous treatment in the UG. Recent research suggests that men's facialwidth-to-height ratio (fWHR) may be a cue of formidability. Men with greater fWHRs are judged as more aggressive <ref type="bibr" coords="2,204.15,484.98,79.35,7.54;2,32.43,495.47,60.35,7.54" target="#b39">(Carré, McCormick, &amp; Mondloch, 2009)</ref>, dominant <ref type="bibr" coords="2,136.51,495.47,83.88,7.54" target="#b27">(Alrajih &amp; Ward, 2014)</ref> and intimidating <ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.43,505.90,131.44,7.54" target="#b50">(Hehman, Leitner, &amp; Gaertner, 2013)</ref>, and are in fact more aggressive both in the laboratory and in real-world settings <ref type="bibr" coords="2,208.52,516.39,74.96,7.54;2,32.43,526.82,19.83,7.54" target="#b38">(Carré &amp; McCormick, 2008)</ref>. Similarly, men with wider faces are trusted less and are less trustworthy in an economic task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,155.00,537.31,86.34,7.54" target="#b74">(Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010)</ref>. Men with wider faces are more likely to be violent <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.54,547.74,92.93,7.54;2,32.43,558.23,19.59,7.54" target="#b40">(Christiansen &amp; Winkler, 1992)</ref>, but less likely to die in fights <ref type="bibr" coords="2,165.09,558.23,105.04,7.54" target="#b75">(Stirrat, Stulp, &amp; Pollet, 2012)</ref>. In sum, there is evidence to suggest that men with wider faces may be calibrated to a more aggressive, exploitative interpersonal strategy, and are perceived as such. Therefore, the logic of the AWA predicts that men with a higher fWHR will receive more generous treatment in the UG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Study 1a: Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1.">Design</head><p>We tested this prediction using stimulus faces drawn from a sample of men who participated in a study on mating psychology and behavior. These men had been measured for physical strength, and photos of their faces were measured for fWHR and rated for health, attractiveness, dominance, and prosociality. We then used these pictures to represent UG partners (hereafter "targets") for a new set of male participants. The above measurements and ratings were initially made because of their relevance to the larger project on mating psychology, but they also allowed us to test predictors of treatment in the UG. On the basis of the AWA, we predicted that fWHR would positively predict generosity received in the UG; the other traits were also examined because prior findings suggest that facial traits may be influential in the UG (see Introduction).</p><p>We employed the strategy method of the UG (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,496.18,87.52,55.35,7.54;2,300.42,97.95,19.06,7.54" target="#b48">Güth &amp; Kocher, 2014)</ref>. In the strategy method, the responder states the minimum offer they would accept from the proposer, rather than accepting or rejecting a specific offer. We refer to this as the responder's "demand." This method allows all subjects to play as both proposer and responder with all possible partners, and elicits continuous measures of UG behavior. During session 1, participants played a series of one-shot ultimatum games (with a $10 endowment) with multiple same-sex partners ("targets") who were represented by a facial photograph. Participants saw a picture of a target's face and were asked to state either an offer or a demand for that target, and this was repeated for all targets (participants were instructed to skip any targets they recognized). Participants were randomly assigned to play first as the proposer toward all targets and then as the responder toward all targets, or vice versa. Targets were presented in a random order. These targets had previously played a single, one-shot UG for real money using the strategy method with an anonymous partner (i.e., their partners were not identified to them, nor they to their partners, in any way beyond knowing that they were all participants in the same study). These recorded UG decisions allowed us to pay our study 1a participants based on the actual outcomes of their games.</p><p>Session 2 occurred a few weeks after session 1. During session 2, subjects rolled a die. If the die came up 6, one of their UG decisions from session 1 was chosen at random, and compared to the corresponding decision of their target from that round. Participants were then paid their earnings for that round in cash. As such, all participant decisions were incentive-compatible, and there was no deception. All targets, photograph raters, and participants were students at UCSB, who gave informed consent to participate or have their picture used for research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2.">Male target stimuli</head><p>Facial photographs of 83 male students were used as stimuli ("targets") in study 1a. They were 18-26 years old (mean = 20.0, s.d. = 1.85). Thirty-five self-identified as Caucasian, 20 as Asian, 16 as Hispanic, and the rest as multiracial or "Other." All gave permission for their photographs to be used for research purposes.</p><p>Photographs were taken directly facing the camera under standardized lighting conditions, and were digitally rotated so that the pupils were aligned on a horizontal axis. fWHR was measured as the distance between the left and right zygion (the outermost edge of the face, before the ear) divided by the distance from the top of the upper lip to the upper edge of the eyelids. Measurements were made independently by two research assistants; there was high agreement between the two sets of measurements (r = .95), and their mean was used in analysis. Photographs were then cropped with an oval around the face. Strength was measured as the composite of grip and chest strength (measured with a dynamometer) and flexed bicep circumference (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,482.12,558.23,49.43,7.54" target="#b72">Sell et al., 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.3.">Raters</head><p>Due to the design of the study from which these target stimuli were drawn, the target face photographs were rated in two batches. Sixtynine students (42 female) rated 39 of the male targets; these raters were 17-22 years old (mean = 18.6 years, s.d. = 0.99). Forty-eight students (19 female) rated the other 44 male targets; these raters' ages ranged from 18 to 22 years (mean = 18.6 years, s.d. = 0.99). Target photos were rated for attractiveness (3 items; alpha = .980), health, dominance (3 items; alpha = .946), and prosociality (3 items; alpha = .974). Items were presented in a random order, and target faces were randomized within items. Full wording of all items and their intra-class correlations are presented in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.4.">Male ultimatum game participants</head><p>Ninety-nine men played the UG with the target face photographs as partners. None of these men were among the participants who had rated the faces. Eleven men showed no variance in their generosity index (see below), likely indicating disengagement from the task, so analysis was restricted to the other 88 participants. (Given the potential uncertainty regarding whether invariance in generosity reflects disengagement or a consistent strategy, analyses were also run including all participants, and statistical results were very similar. Generally speaking, including all participants changed zero-order correlations only in the third decimal place.) Due to experimenter error, we did not record the ages of these participants. However, they were drawn from the same subject pool as the raters used in study 1a, so we expect a similar age distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.5.">Data analysis</head><p>Mean values for each rating dimension for each target face were computed and used in subsequent analyses. We calculated bivariate correlations in order to evaluate the zero-order effect of each of the target traits (measured fWHR, measured strength, and ratings of attractiveness, health, dominance and prosociality) on how the target faces were treated in the ultimatum game. <ref type="table" coords="3,54.48,296.71,26.27,7.54" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> presents the correlations between fWHR, strength, attractiveness, health, dominance and prosociality for the male targets. (Note that the traits rated in study 1b are included in the same table, for efficiency of presentation.) Surprisingly, fWHR was not significantly correlated with strength or dominance, suggesting that it may not in fact be a reliable cue of formidability, at least in this sample. It was, however, negatively correlated with ratings of attractiveness, prosociality, and health, suggesting that raters had negative impressions of men with wider faces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Study 1a: Results</head><p>There was a significant negative correlation between the mean offers and mean demands received by targets (i.e., the UG partner in the photograph), r(83) = − .45, p b .001, such that targets who received higher offers also received lower demands. This indicates that participants used offers and demands in concert when responding to UG partners; therefore we used mean generosity received by a target (generosity = offer-demand) as the primary measure of treatment in the UG. <ref type="table" coords="3,54.48,474.55,25.70,7.54" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> presents the zero-order correlations of mean generosity received by targets with their fWHR, strength, and ratings of attractiveness, health, dominance and prosociality (for efficiency of presentation, the traits rated in study 1b are also included in this table). fWHR was significantly negatively correlated with generosity received, but all of the other traits positively predicted mean generosity received. Effect sizes were especially large for health and attractiveness ratings (which were highly correlated with each other; see <ref type="table" coords="3,261.70,547.80,25.24,7.54" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), with these traits accounting for nearly two-thirds of the variance in how well specific targets were treated (rs N 0.75).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Study 1a: Discussion</head><p>The results of study 1a defied our expectations: fWHR negatively predicted generosity received in the UG. This may be because fWHR in this sample did not reliably cue the likelihood of winning a violent conflict over resources, as suggested by the lack of significant correlations between fWHR and strength and dominance. The negative correlation between fWHR and prosociality suggests that fWHR was instead used as a cue that an individual was exploitative or uncooperative.</p><p>More importantly, these results suggested to us that participants may have treated the UG as an opportunity for partner choice. The large effects of health, attractiveness, and prosociality suggest that participants gave preferential treatment to the types of people who are generally in high demand as social partners. As such, these results were consistent with a PC model for explaining UG behavior. On the other hand, the positive effect of dominance is still potentially consistent with the AWA model, given that individuals are generally prone to cede resources to dominant individuals. The effect of strength is consistent with both the AWA and PC models, since male strength may have been a reliable cue of either dangerousness or productivity in ancestral environments <ref type="bibr" coords="3,504.85,432.71,56.71,7.54" target="#b28">(Apicella, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,310.51,443.21,130.33,7.54" target="#b82">von Rueden, Gurven, &amp; Kaplan, 2008)</ref>. These ambiguities led us to have the target faces rated for additional traits in order to test between the PC and AWA models (Study 1b).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study 1b: Introduction</head><p>Study 1b used the same UG decisions as in 1a, but the target faces were rated for additional traits in order to better test the AWA and PC theories against each other. In particular, we obtained ratings of productivity in an ancestral-like environment (e.g., how good the target would be at finding food on a desert island), dangerousness in response to a Note. Variables 1−6 were collected in study 1a, and variables 7-10 were collected in study 1b. low offer (e.g., the target's likelihood of starting a fight in response to an insulting offer), and desirability as a friend.

Second, proposers in study 1a could have attempted to maximize their earnings in the game by matching their offer to the demand expected from the responder. Third, participants may have simply reciprocated the treatment they anticipated receiving from their partner. We statistically controlled for each of these possibilities in order to confirm that the effects of PC heuristics obtained above and beyond these other potential influences. Note that these are particularly stringent tests of the PC model, since attractiveness may contain cues of partner value (see Section 5), and the PC model actually predicts that participants will prefer partners whom they expect to be generous; the PC model, however, uniquely predicts that other cues of partner value will matter even controlling for attractiveness halo effects and desires to reciprocate expected treatment.</p></div>

To do this, we calculated, for each participant, the correlations between UG decisions and target traits. The absolute value of these correlations indexes each participant's sensitivity to the various target traits. We then correlated these sensitivity indexes with the participants' mean earnings across all rounds (if they were to be paid out). The correlation between sensitivity to target traits and mean earnings reveals how sensitivity to various target traits affects earnings in the UG. <ref type="table" coords="4,312.38,547.80,25.65,7.54" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> presents the correlations between the ratings of productivity, dangerousness, desirability as a friend, and social status, as well as all of the traits rated or measured in study 1a. Of note, the productivity composite generally correlated highly and positively with other positive traits (like friend desirability) but also with dangerousness, although dangerousness did not exhibit strong correlations with the positive traits. This suggests that some cues signal both productivity and dangerousness, but that other cues differentiate between productive individuals who are desirable as opposed to undesirable social partners. <ref type="table" coords="4,312.38,673.32,26.21,7.54" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> presents the zero-order correlations of mean generosity received by targets with their ratings of productivity, dangerousness, desirability as a friend and social status (for convenience, the variables from study 1a are also shown in this table). Dangerousness was significantly, positively correlated with mean generosity received, albeit with a modest effect size; although on its face this supports the AWA model, this could be a byproduct of the positive correlation between dangerousness and productivity (see Section 2.3.2 below). Productivity, desirability as a friend, and social status were all very highly and positively correlated with generosity received (r's ≥ 0.7), which is consistent with the PC model. <ref type="figure" coords="5,54.48,108.43,19.30,7.54">Fig. 1</ref> presents the results of the model in which productivity and dangerousness were entered as mediators of the effect of strength on generosity received, and shows that apparent productivity, but not dangerousness, significantly and completely mediated the effect of strength.

(This same reversal also occurred when productivity (β = .89, t(80) = 9.27, p b .001) and dangerousness (β = −.31, t(80) = −3.23, p = .002) were entered as the only predictors of generosity received.)

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Study 1b: Discussion</head><p>The results of study 1b robustly supported the PC hypothesis over the AWA hypothesis. A target's apparent productivity, social status and desirability as a friend all had large positive effects on the generosity that target received in the UG. While apparent dangerousness had a positive zero-order effect on generosity received, dangerousness had a significant negative effect on generosity once productivity was controlled for, suggesting that formidability above and beyond implied productivity is actually penalized in the UG. Moreover, the positive effect of strength on generosity observed in study 1a was mediated by ratings of productivity, further supporting the partner choice model.</p><p>The existence of a market of potential cooperators likely limits the ability of even formidable individuals to coerce others into cooperative relationships over the long run, given the effectiveness of alliances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,332.34,275.79,69.13,7.54" target="#b85">Wrangham, 1999)</ref> and social exclusion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,508.71,275.79,52.82,7.54" target="#b26">Aktipis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,310.51,286.28,121.12,7.54" target="#b42">Debove, Baumard, &amp; André, 2015)</ref> in mitigating risks from exploitative individuals. This may explain why men appear to respond to apparently dangerous potential partners with aversion, rather than appeasement. However, future research should examine how individual differences (e.g., the perceiver's own formidability) and contextual variables (e.g., the cost of partner switching) moderate the effect of dangerousness on cooperative surplus divisions. In addition, it is possible that the use of target photographs in the controlled setting of the lab muted the effect of target dangerousness (and potentially other target traits), compared to what their effect would be in a spontaneous, face-to-face interaction. Testing the PC and AWA models against each other in more naturalistic settings may be a valuable avenue for future research.</p><p>Importantly, we observed effects of partner choice heuristics above and beyond attractiveness halo effects, strategies to maximize earnings, and motivations to reciprocate the target's quality of treatment. In fact, participants appeared to implement costly partner choice heuristics: men offered less to targets who looked like they would demand more, thereby reducing the odds of their offer being accepted, and sensitivity to target traits was negatively correlated with participant earnings. While this behavior is "anomalous" with respect to maximizing earnings in the UG, it is sensible as an output of a mechanism designed by natural selection for an ecology in which the benefits of long-term cooperative relationships may justify the costs incurred in establishing those relationships (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,375.48,526.88,152.66,7.54" target="#b44">Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Controlling for the target's expected generosity (i.e., controlling for reciprocity motivations) is a particularly strong test of the PC model, since the PC model actually predicts that individuals should be more generous toward partners whom they expect to be generous in turn (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,328.31,579.15,48.31,7.54" target="#b31">Barclay, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,377.91,579.15,70.60,7.54" target="#b34">Baumard et al., 2013)</ref>. Our results (see Supplementary Online Materials; table S3, available on the journal's Web site at www. ehbonline.org) show that, on top of being generous toward apparently generous partners, people have additional strong preferences for partners who appear to have other components of long-term cooperative value (e.g., those who appear healthy, productive and high in social status).</p><p>The strong effect of ratings of ancestral productivity is an important addition to the partner choice literature. Previous modeling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,535.12,652.40,26.51,7.54;5,310.51,662.83,20.27,7.54" target="#b26">Aktipis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,332.86,662.83,52.11,7.54" target="#b47">Fu et al., 2008)</ref> and empirical (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,455.87,662.83,93.34,7.54" target="#b45">Delton &amp; Robertson, 2012)</ref> research has focused on dispositional cooperativeness as the criterion by which partners are chosen or rejected. While individuals should certainly prefer partners who are cooperative, generous and value them highly, our results show that men also prefer partners who have above-average resource production capabilities. This is consistent with partner choice theory <ref type="bibr" coords="5,323.49,725.59,51.32,7.54" target="#b31">(Barclay, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,376.27,725.59,95.49,7.54">Debove et al., under review)</ref> and research in other species on partner choice for competence <ref type="bibr" coords="5,446.97,736.08,3.46,7.54">(</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="6,32.43,56.11,98.91,7.54" target="#b79">Vail, Manica, &amp; Bshary, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,133.14,56.11,123.39,7.54" target="#b81">von Bayern, Clayton, &amp; Emery, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, the fact that contemporary economic decisions were strongly predicted by ratings of productivity in a hunter-gatherer-like environment (which appear irrelevant or even bizarre in a modern context) suggests that humans implement a psychology of partner choice that was designed by natural selection for an ancestral environment. The positive effect of target productivity on generosity above and beyond the effect of expected target generosity (see <ref type="table" coords="6,108.20,129.35,175.29,7.54" target="#tab_3">Supplementary Online Materials; table S3, available</ref> on the journal's Web site at www.ehbonline.org), and the robustness of the effect of productivity in comparison to prosociality (see Section 2.3.3), raises the possibility that men might be willing to trade off generosity in a partner in favor of productivity; future research will be necessary to identify the precise parameters of that trade off (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,192.13,181.62,91.38,7.54">Debove et al., under review</ref> for modeling results to a similar effect).</p></div>

We expected replication of the study 1 findings of better treatment of partners who appeared healthier and more prosocial, since these traits should have predicted larger streams of benefits for women's cooperative partners in ancestral environments. We measured strength in women but did not expect to replicate its positive effect on UG treatment in men; since women have historically been less involved in large game hunting and coalitional violence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="6,225.53,338.55,57.92,7.54" target="#b60">Marlowe, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,32.43,349.04,65.80,7.54" target="#b85">Wrangham, 1999)</ref>, for which strength is beneficial <ref type="bibr" coords="6,224.73,349.04,58.71,7.54" target="#b28">(Apicella, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,32.43,359.47,89.61,7.54" target="#b82">von Rueden et al., 2008)</ref>, women's perceived partner value may be less related to this variable.

Perceived dangerousness was tested in order to evaluate whether the AWA model might account for women's behavior with same-sex partners; we predicted that it would not. Ratings of target face attractiveness were collected, allowing tests of partial effects of other variables when controlling for attractiveness, as well as allowing us to test whether more attractive individuals are treated better in the UG.</p><p>To further extend the PC model, we identified social status as another potential component of partner value, since individuals who are high in social status may be able to provide greater benefits to their partners by virtue of their social influence, and high social status may indicate high quality and quantity of outside options for cooperation. We therefore had the female target faces used in study 2 rated for social status as well, and predicted that social status would positively predict the quality of treatment received in the UG.</p></div>

The only difference from study 1a is that not all of the targets used as UG partners in study 2 had previously played the UG. Some of the targets had previously played a hypothetical, one-shot UG with a partner with whom they had recently had a conversation; other targets had never played the UG. Participants in study 2 were told truthfully that some of the targets they would play with had previously played the UG, but that they would be unable to tell which targets had or had not played the UG. When participants returned for session 2, they rolled a die. If they rolled a 6, one of their decisions was matched with the corresponding decision from a target who had previously played the UG, and they were paid their game earnings in cash. Therefore all participant decisions were incentive-compatible, and no deception was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Female target stimuli</head><p>Facial photographs of 100 female students that were collected in two unrelated studies were used as targets, i.e., to represent UG partners to the participants in study 2.

These same students also estimated the offer and demand that each target would make if the target were playing the UG. Each rater was randomly assigned to rate or estimate 5-6 items, and ratings on specific items continued until intra-class correlations for all rated items were at least .7. Due to experimenter error, we did not record the ages of these raters, but they were drawn from the same subject pool as the raters used for studies 1a and 1b.

Third, in order to control for participants' motivation to reciprocate the quality of treatment the target is expected to provide, we computed partial correlations between UG treatment received and target traits, controlling for the targets' expected decisions.</p><p>Finally, in order to measure the effect of partner choice heuristics on earnings in the UG, we calculated the correlations between participant earnings and sensitivity to each of the target traits tested in study 2 (see Section 2.2.3). <ref type="table" coords="7,54.48,150.27,26.56,7.54" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> presents the correlations between all of the measured and rated traits in study 2.

This indicates that women deployed their offers and demands in conflict with each other, such that targets who received higher offers also received higher demands. The generosity index used in study 1 would therefore obscure effects on both offers and demands, so offers and demands were analyzed separately. <ref type="table" coords="7,54.48,286.28,25.31,7.54" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> presents the zero-order correlations between target traits and mean offers and demands received. Targets who appeared healthier, more attractive, more prosocial, more productive and higher in social status all received significantly higher offers, although effect sizes were generally smaller than for men. As expected, strength was uncorrelated with offers received, and dangerousness was marginally, negatively correlated with the size of offers. These patterns appear to support the PC model over the AWA model. When productivity and prosociality were entered into the same regression model predicting mean offers received, prosociality had a significant positive effect, β = .26, t(96) = 2.61, p = .010, while productivity did not, β = .15, t(96) = 1.47, p = .15. This suggests that women prioritize prosociality over productivity in a partner, which stands in contrast to the results in men (see Section 2.3.3).</p></div>

There were significant positive correlations between mean offers received by targets and the mean offers they were expected to make, and between the mean demands received by targets and the mean demands they were expected to make (both correlations: r(100) = .37, p b .001). However, ratings of health, social status and attractiveness had significant partial correlations with offers received, controlling for expected offers, and ratings of target health, prosociality, social status, and attractiveness had significant partial correlations with demands received, controlling for expected demands (see SOM, <ref type="table" coords="7,502.64,87.51,28.83,7.54">Table S7</ref>). There was a significant positive correlation between the mean demands expected from targets and the mean offers they received, r(100) = .22, p = .028, which is consistent with an income-maximizing strategy, but there were significant effects of health, prosociality, social status, attractiveness, and dangerousness, on offers, controlling for expected demands (see SOM, <ref type="table" coords="7,372.81,150.27,27.50,7.54">Table S6</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Study 2: Discussion</head><p>As expected, female participants made higher offers in the UG to targets who appeared healthier, more attractive, more productive, more prosocial and higher in social status. This suggests that women also interpreted the UG as an opportunity to establish a long-term cooperative relationship, and therefore offered to divide the surplus based on partner value. However, participants also made higher demands to targets who appeared healthier, more attractive and higher in social status. There are several possible explanations for this inconsistency. Women may implement partner choice heuristics, but may also be more demanding of attractive mating rivals (contrast <ref type="table" coords="7,477.64,359.47,76.85,7.54" target="#tab_4">Table 4 with Table S5</ref>). Women face a tradeoff between forming cooperative same-sex relationships and competing with same-sex rivals (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,480.30,380.39,77.45,7.54" target="#b36">Benenson et al., 2009)</ref>, and intrasexual competition may be manifested in the UG <ref type="bibr" coords="7,529.68,390.88,31.90,7.54;7,310.51,401.31,40.71,7.54" target="#b55">(Lucas &amp; Koff, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,354.10,401.31,102.00,7.54" target="#b56">Lucas, Koff, &amp; Skeath, 2007)</ref>. Alternatively, women may make high offers to apparently-valuable partners to attract them for a cooperative relationship, but then make high demands to those same partners to ensure that they will reciprocate that generosity. This view may be supported by our finding that women prioritize prosociality over productivity in a partner (Section 3.3.1), and research suggesting that equality is emphasized more in female relationships, relative to male relationships (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,394.07,474.55,57.35,7.54" target="#b35">Benenson, 2013)</ref>. Future research should disentangle these issues.</p><p>Importantly, the effects of partner choice criteria are robust to controlling for income-maximization strategies and reciprocity motivations. While social status, prosociality and dangerousness retained effects on offers after controlling for target attractiveness, controlling for attractiveness substantially reduced the effects of these and all of the other traits. This may represent more than just an attractiveness halo effect; women in ancestral environments likely derived substantial social influence from their attractiveness (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,470.50,568.66,52.99,7.54" target="#b72">Sell et al., 2009)</ref>, so attractiveness may have been an important cue of women's abilities to generate benefits for social partners.  As expected, there was no effect of targets' strength on offers or demands received, and the effect of perceived productivity on UG treatment was weaker than among men. <ref type="figure" coords="8,44.39,118.87,18.45,7.54" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> compares the zero-order effects of strength, health, attractiveness, prosociality, productivity, dangerousness, social status and estimated UG behavior on offers received in men and women. There are statistically significant sex differences in the effects of target strength, attractiveness, dangerousness and expected demands. Descriptively, in all cases the effect size is larger among men than among women. We entered all of the variables in <ref type="figure" coords="8,132.04,181.62,19.18,7.54" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> into multiple regressions predicting mean offers separately for men and women. The overall R 2 for men was .69 and the overall R 2 for women was .30; using Fisher's r-to-z transformation, this is a significant difference in total variance predicted, z = 3.84, p b .001, suggesting that women were significantly less influenced overall by cues of partner value than men were.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">General discussion</head><p>We found that participants' offers and demands in the ultimatum game were related to facial cues of their partner's value as a long-term cooperative partner. Men were more generous to targets who appeared more attractive, prosocial, productive, dominant, healthier, stronger, higher in social status and more desirable as a friend. Women made higher offers and higher demands to targets who appeared healthier, more attractive, and higher in social status; higher offers to targets who appeared more prosocial and productive; and lower offers to targets who appeared more dangerous. Most of the effects of perceived partner traits cannot be explained by attractiveness halo effects, income maximizing strategies, or reciprocity motivations. These findings represent the most direct empirical evidence to date of a human psychology of cooperative surplus division based on partner choice criteria, and they suggest a new interpretation of the UG as an opportunity for overtures to potential cooperative partners.</p><p>Our results suggest that behavior in the ultimatum game is generated by psychological mechanisms specialized for long-term social exchange relationships (see <ref type="bibr" coords="8,131.30,453.63,94.13,7.54" target="#b41">Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2005)</ref>, and therefore that effects of partner traits that are outside of the structure of the game may be central to understanding the UG. Since humans likely evolved in social environments characterized by highly-valuable longterm cooperative relationships (see <ref type="bibr" coords="8,160.61,495.47,66.08,7.54" target="#b44">Delton et al., 2011)</ref>, a one-shot UG may be interpreted as though it were an opening bid for an ongoing cooperative relationship within a biological market of cooperators <ref type="bibr" coords="8,32.43,526.88,56.30,7.54" target="#b31">(Barclay, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,91.73,526.88,96.90,7.54" target="#b67">Noë &amp; Hammerstein, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,188.63,526.88,22.90,7.54" target="#b68">, 1995</ref>. Therefore, offers and demands in the UG are generated by an evolved heuristic for partner choice that implements a rule like "be more generous to more valuable long-term cooperative partners." Partner choice theory suggests that a potential partner's "market value" as a long-term cooperator is a function of their ability to create future benefits, their expected generosity in sharing those benefits, and their outside options for production <ref type="bibr" coords="8,317.93,108.43,56.31,7.54" target="#b31">(Barclay, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,377.06,108.43,80.09,7.54" target="#b34">Baumard et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,460.00,108.43,87.31,7.54" target="#b87">Zaatari &amp; Trivers, 2007)</ref>; consistent with this, we observed that traits such as apparent health, productivity, prosociality, and social status had important effects on offers and demands in the UG.</p><p>These data illustrate the close link between cooperation and selectivity regarding cooperative partners (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="8,449.97,160.70,101.48,7.54;8,300.41,171.19,59.79,7.54" target="#b64">McNamara, Barta, Fromhage, &amp; Houston, 2008)</ref>. The human psychology of partner choice appears designed to target valuable partners for relationship initiation and establish acceptable "terms of trade" with new partners, rather than establish the greatest possible number of new cooperative relationships (which would manifest as indiscriminate hypergenerosity in the UG). In addition, the system is not designed to establish a relationship at any cost, even with apparently valuable partners, because individuals who accepted worse terms of trade than they could receive from either the same or other partners would likely have faced adverse selection pressures <ref type="bibr" coords="8,321.33,265.30,51.49,7.54" target="#b78">(Trivers, 1971)</ref>. While this may not maximize the number of accepted offers in the UG, a heuristic that prioritizes the quality rather than the quantity of cooperative relationships appears well-adapted to an ecology in which potential partners vary in value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="8,520.38,296.70,31.08,7.54;8,300.41,307.13,20.82,7.54" target="#b28">Apicella, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,323.43,307.13,100.65,7.54">Debove et al., under review)</ref>, and an individual can only have a limited number of social exchange relationships due to time constraints and the finite nature of social closeness and caring (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="8,513.75,328.06,37.73,7.54;8,300.42,338.55,54.10,7.54" target="#b46">DeScioli &amp; Kurzban, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,356.60,338.55,88.19,7.54" target="#b77">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Our results suggest that the human psychology of partner choice is specialized to an ancestral ecology. Men, but not women, were more generous toward physically stronger partners. This effect was driven by perceptions that stronger men would be more productive in an environment similar to that in which our species evolved, but not by perceptions of dangerousness, suggesting that the psychological mechanisms involved are designed to establish cooperative relationships with stronger men rather than merely to avoid violent retribution. In a modern context, this sex difference is senseless: for the types of cooperation that our participants typically engage in (e.g., group assignments for a class), physical strength is equally useless for men and women. However, men likely faced much stronger selection pressures from coalitional violence and large-game hunting (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="8,447.02,474.56,58.58,7.54" target="#b60">Marlowe, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,508.36,474.56,43.09,7.54;8,300.41,484.99,19.68,7.54" target="#b85">Wrangham, 1999)</ref>, domains in which physical strength does predict productivity <ref type="bibr" coords="8,300.41,495.48,58.80,7.54" target="#b28">(Apicella, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,362.04,495.48,89.96,7.54" target="#b82">von Rueden et al., 2008)</ref>. The effect of strength on men's bargaining psychology is typically framed in terms of the AWA (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="8,318.84,516.39,72.15,7.54" target="#b69">Petersen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,392.31,516.39,49.53,7.54" target="#b72">Sell et al., 2009</ref>); however, a widespread preference for physically strong men as productive partners provides an alternative account for why strong men may receive more generous divisions of cooperative surpluses (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,444.47,547.75,70.55,7.54" target="#b42">Debove et al., 2015</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" coords="8,300.41,558.23,175.96,7.54" target="#b57">Lukaszewski, Simmons, Anderson, &amp; Roney, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Additional sex differences suggest that the partner choice interpretation of UG behavior was more strongly supported for men than for women. Men were more sensitive to target traits overall, and only men reduced their earnings by calibrating their decisions to target traits. Women appeared to follow the income-maximizing strategy by matching their offers to the targets' expected demands, while men made lower offers to targets with higher expected demands. These results suggest that men, but not women, are willing to incur immediate costs in order to cooperate selectively with partners who display cues of long-term partner value. Women, unlike men, both offered more to and demanded more from seemingly high value partners, suggesting that women's UG behavior may have involved an element of competition with same-sex rivals or a greater insistence on reciprocity from cooperative partners (Section 3.4). Overall, these sex differences are consistent with evidence suggesting that men are more willing than women to tolerate costs in a relationship in order to maintain access to cooperative partners who can generate future benefits, likely due to selection pressures from coalitional violence and large game hunting <ref type="bibr" coords="9,196.08,56.11,97.45,7.54;9,42.52,66.60,40.24,7.54" target="#b30">(Balliet, Li, Macfarlan, &amp; Van Vugt, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,84.73,66.60,76.26,7.54" target="#b36">Benenson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,162.90,66.60,38.03,7.54" target="#b80">Vigil, 2007)</ref>. Alternative explanations for the observed sex differences include the possibility that we did not measure the target traits that are most important in female partner choice, or that male faces trigger more powerful behavioral inferences than do female faces. An additional limitation of the present research is that trait inferences from faces are confounded with each other. Alternative methods of representing targets will be important for testing the individual effects of traits and their prioritization in computations of partner value. For instance, the reported effect of social status is ambiguous. It is possible that apparently high status targets receive more generous treatment because they are capable of providing additional benefits to partners via social influence, or because they are assumed to have greater outside options.</p><p>We expect that the human psychology of partner choice will be an exciting area of research in the near future. The heuristic we suggest above ("be more generous to more valuable long-term cooperative partners") is flexible enough to be adaptively implemented in a variety of social and economic contexts. For example, the behaviors that are considered generous, and the cues that contribute to the estimation of partner value, may be different for different ecologies and types of cooperation. In addition, parameters such as the costs of searching for new partners should calibrate the prioritization of partner choice strategies relative to other behavioral strategies, such as partner control <ref type="bibr" coords="9,167.30,296.71,91.75,7.54" target="#b32">(Barclay &amp; Raihani, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,261.64,296.71,31.95,7.54;9,42.52,307.14,43.81,7.54" target="#b71">Schino &amp; Aureli, 2016)</ref>. It will be important for researchers to systematically map the partner choice psychologies of men and women, including individual and contextual variation in partner choice criteria, effects of different information modalities (e.g., visual information vs. direct experience with a partner vs. communicated information on a partner), and behaviors and judgments in a variety of tasks (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" coords="9,184.82,359.47,108.77,7.54" target="#b63">McCabe, Smith, &amp; LePore, 2000</ref> for possible limitations of the strategy method in economic games).</p><p>Finally, our data suggest a novel explanation for the advantageous treatment that attractive individuals typically receive in economic settings. A proposed explanation for the "beauty premium" is that it is primarily the result of men attempting to court or maintain access to attractive women (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" coords="9,154.66,422.23,90.05,7.54">Maestripieri et al., in press</ref>). This cannot account for the strong effects of attractiveness that we observed, however, given that we conducted the UG exclusively with same-sex partners. We suggest that attractive individuals may be preferred as cooperative partners because many of the traits that made individuals desirable as mates also made them desirable as cooperators within ancestral environments (for example, apparent health, prosociality and competence), and so attractiveness may serve as a summary judgment of partner value. While this explanation is not mutually exclusive with the courtshipbased explanation, it may spur new thinking and research on the topic.</p></div>
