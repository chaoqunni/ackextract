<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Extant research confirms the importance of value cocreation through customer participation (CP), but relatively little is known about whether and how it creates an enjoyable experience for customers and service employees and the consequential outcomes of this positive affective experience. This study applies the concept of flow as an overarching framework and draws theoretical support from social cognitive theory, particularly its extension (i.e., the conceptual model of relational efficacy beliefs), to examine how customers and employees derive enjoyment from CP conditional on their perceived efficacy of themselves (self-efficacy [SE]) and their partners (other-efficacy [OE]) in financial services. Empirical results from 223 client-financial adviser dyads confirm that participation enjoyment, in addition to economic and relational values, mediates the impact of CP on participants' satisfaction evaluations, with SE positively moderating CP's impact on participation enjoyment. The synergistic effect of SE and OE on participation enjoyment also differs for clients versus financial advisers: Even incongruent levels of SE and OE can enhance participation enjoyment as long as they help validate role expectations of the respective participants.</p></div>

Taken together, although recent research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,341.50,633.52,111.99,16.27">Chan, Yim, and Lam 2010)</ref> has confirmed the cocreation of utilitarian or extrinsic values through CP, still little is known about whether and how CP can create psychological benefits (i.e., an enjoyable experience) for customers and service employees and the consequential outcomes of this positive affective experience.</p><p>Furthermore, CP has arguably created a challenging situation for both customers and employees, who must take responsibility for their new roles and tasks in various service contexts (e.g., health insurance service <ref type="bibr" coords="2,235.92,46.84,53.28,16.27;2,54.00,58.34,91.26,16.27" target="#b71">[McKee, Simmers, and Licata 2006]</ref>, online self-service <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.03,58.34,65.00,16.27;2,54.00,69.84,39.02,16.27" target="#b97">[Van Beuningen et al. 2009</ref>], financial services <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.12,69.84,109.62,16.27">[Chan, Yim, and Lam 2010]</ref>). Customers' and employees' ability and skills in dealing with the challenges brought on by CP thus introduce an issue of confidence and perceived capability (or efficacy) in participating, which, according to flow theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,248.48,115.84,41.41,16.27;2,54.00,127.34,52.76,16.27" target="#b37">(Csikszentmihalyi 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,115.46,127.34,17.22,16.27" target="#b37">(Csikszentmihalyi , 1990</ref>, affects the creation of an enjoyable experience.

This is in contrast with its prevalent treatment as a moderator in other literature, such as health/occupational health/ stress (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,102.93,346.84,85.21,16.27" target="#b56">Jex and Bliese 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.36,346.84,66.45,16.27" target="#b68">May et al. 1997)</ref>, organizational behavior/management (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.76,358.34,80.16,16.27;2,54.00,369.84,76.86,16.27" target="#b41">Dierdorff, Surface, and Brown 2010)</ref>, and education (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,235.20,369.84,55.10,16.27;2,54.00,381.34,103.69,16.27" target="#b82">Pinquart, Silbereisen, and Juang 2004)</ref>. An examination of the moderating role of efficacy in the cocreation of values through CP is also important from the perspective of fostering continuous CP because it involves viewing it as a persistent, rather than short-term, behavior.</p><p>More important, the limited focus of extant marketing studies on only the role of SE in CP is no longer appropriate because customers' and employees' participation in service coproduction necessitates interdependent relationships between parties. In relational contexts that require the effort of two parties for successful performance (e.g., professional services), both parties' SE likely interacts dynamically with their other-efficacy (OE) beliefs-a person's beliefs about his or her partner's ability to perform particular behaviorsto influence their behaviors and attitudes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.85,543.34,64.21,16.27" target="#b23">(Bandura 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,54.00,554.84,87.14,16.27" target="#b63">Lent and Lopez 2002)</ref>. For example, when a client's lack of confidence that her suggestions will be helpful to her financial adviser (low SE) is compensated by her confidence in the financial adviser's ability to handle her suggestions and identify suitable investments (high OE), she may still enjoy the participating process. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish SE and OE and examine both their separate and interacting effects on value cocreation through CP. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,69.00,647.84,99.70,16.27" target="#b63">Lent and Lopez's (2002)</ref> conceptual framework of relational efficacy beliefs is particularly relevant for studying 122 / Journal of Marketing, November 2012 CP in complex and high-credence services with dyadic interactions involving both customers and employees in close relationships (e.g., patient-doctor, client-financial adviser). This conceptual framework not only argues for the importance of considering a network of efficacy beliefs about the self (i.e., SE) and the other (i.e., OE) to illuminate interpersonal functioning in close relationships but also proposes exploring their synergistic effects, particularly in terms of the consequences arising from discrepancies between these efficacy beliefs. Understanding the effects of these discrepancies is important because they could vary depending on the role-specific (e.g., client vs. financial adviser) normative expectations of the parties. However, to the best of our knowledge, neither these proposed synergistic effects nor their variations due to expectations of the parties have been examined in any literature.</p><p>In an attempt to address these research gaps, we adopt flow theory to propose and test a model of customers and service employees deriving enjoyment from CP conditional on their perceived efficacy about themselves and their partners in the context of financial services. "Customer participation" refers to the extent to which customers expend time and effort to share information, provide suggestions, and get involved in decision making during the service production and delivery process <ref type="bibr" coords="2,404.78,311.59,69.84,16.27" target="#b21">(Auh et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,477.81,311.59,80.26,16.27;2,318.01,323.10,42.09,16.27" target="#b3">Bolton and Saxena-Iyer 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.31,323.10,110.12,16.27">Chan, Yim, and Lam 2010)</ref>.

First, it confirms the significant role of enjoyment (an intrinsic value), in addition to and separate from extrinsic values, in mediating CP and its consequential service outcomes. This endeavor helps fill a gap in value cocreation by complementing the recent work of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.61,449.71,89.45,16.27;2,318.01,461.22,24.99,16.27">Chan, Yim, and Lam (2010)</ref>, which predominately focuses on examining utilitarian or extrinsic values cocreated through CP, with an experiential perspective <ref type="bibr" coords="2,402.83,484.24,52.02,16.27" target="#b45">(Etgar 2008)</ref>. Creating an enjoyable participation experience for customers and employees is critical for value cocreation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.31,507.26,120.73,16.27;2,318.01,518.77,23.33,16.27" target="#b80">(Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008)</ref> because value is only created when an offering is experienced <ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.75,530.28,140.49,16.27" target="#b83">(Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,515.49,530.28,42.57,16.27;2,318.01,541.79,50.44,16.27" target="#b98">Vargo and Lusch 2004)</ref>. Understanding how CP drives participation enjoyment for both customers and employees also should help managers meet the experiential needs of both groups for effective CP.</p><p>Second, this study represents a first attempt in the service literature to examine how customers' and employees' relational efficacy beliefs moderate the extent to which CP enhances their enjoyment and the consequential outcomes. The proposed model with a focus on the cocreation of intrinsic value of enjoyment and the moderating effects of efficacy is also theoretically grounded in the concept of flow that a good match between the level of challenges (e.g., those brought on by CP) and a consumer's skills generates an enjoyable state <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.30,691.42,101.82,16.27" target="#b37">(Csikszentmihalyi 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,536.18,691.42,17.53,16.27;2,318.01,702.93,131.83,16.27">Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre 1989)</ref>. This application of flow theory also extends and enriches previous findings on the boundary conditions of value cocreation of CP, from dispositional or trait-based factors, such as cultural values <ref type="bibr" coords="3,267.10,47.30,26.94,16.27;3,54.00,59.26,85.40,16.27">(Chan, Yim, and Lam 2010)</ref>, to the state-or task-based factor of efficacy to participate. Relational efficacy beliefs are more manageable and practical from a company's perspective because they can be influenced more readily through company actions, such as education and training <ref type="bibr" coords="3,234.61,107.10,53.70,16.27" target="#b79">(Parker 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Third, this is the first marketing study to distinguish efficacy about oneself (SE) and one's partner (OE) and to consider them from the perspectives of both the customer and the service employee. This effort extends the examination of efficacy in service participation from a single-party perspective to a multiparty, interdependent relationship perspective. Moreover, examining the synergistic effects of SE and OE, particularly the consequences of congruence and incongruence between these efficacy beliefs, sheds new light on the unexplored but critical impacts of participants' role expectations. This study not only considers the effects of high and low efficacy but also explores the differential impacts of efficacy discrepancies on customers and employees based on their different normative role expectations.</p><p>Finally, this study extends the application of flow theory in marketing by going beyond the limited context of online behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,119.57,310.42,116.85,16.27" target="#b67">Mathwick and Rigdon 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,239.63,310.42,54.40,16.27">Novak, Hoff-</ref>Do Customers and Employees Enjoy Service Participation? / 123 man, and Yung 2000).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background and Hypotheses</head><p>Our conceptual model ( <ref type="figure" coords="3,417.70,179.38,33.27,16.27">Figure 1</ref>) depicts how CP enables customers and service employees to cocreate the intrinsic value of participation enjoyment, in addition to extrinsic values (i.e., relational value for both customers and employees, economic value for customers, and job stress for employees), which then affects their satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. The cocreation of participation enjoyment is further conditional on their efficacy beliefs (SE and OE) of participation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Economic and Relational Values</head><p>Early research has argued that CP should deliver value to both customers and firms <ref type="bibr" coords="4,158.76,152.64,71.04,16.27" target="#b38">(Dabholkar 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,232.52,152.64,56.41,16.27;4,54.00,164.34,33.52,16.27" target="#b74">Mills and Morris 1986)</ref>. However, findings on the effect of CP on customer satisfaction and loyalty are often mixed and inconsistent (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,77.54,187.74,114.10,16.27" target="#b31">Bendapudi and Leone 2003)</ref>. Motivated by the value cocreation premise of the service-dominant logic, Chan, Yim, and Lam's (2010) study represents a recent attempt to examine the effectiveness of CP in cocreating economic and relational values for both customers and employees.</p><p>Their study contributes to the literature by establishing that CP drives performance outcomes (i.e., customer satisfaction, employee job satisfaction, and employee job performance) through the creation of these values. Specifically, CP offers customers economic values (i.e., higher quality, more customized services, and more control) and strengthens the relational bond between customers and employees, but it also increases employees' job stress and reduces their job satisfaction. Nevertheless, previous research on CP, including Chan, Yim, and Lam's (2010) study, has predominantly focused on the cocreation of extrinsic values of an economic and relational nature.

Selected employees were asked to fill out one "employee" questionnaire for each of their "active" customers with whom they had business transactions during the data collection period. 2 This questionnaire included measures of employee SE and OE, participation enjoyment, job stress and relational value arising from CP, and job satisfaction. Of the 376 selected employees, 246 returned usable questionnaires for at least one active customer (65% response rate).

This questionnaire included measures of CP, customer SE and OE, participation enjoyment, economic and relational values cocreated through CP, satisfaction, and repurchase intention. Of the 1869 customer respondents, 953 returned usable questionnaires (51% response rate).

Customer participation enjoyment and economic and relational values also are significantly related to customer satisfaction.

Following <ref type="bibr" coords="12,385.44,105.89,96.22,16.27" target="#b17">Aiken and West (1991)</ref>, we used unstandardized regression coefficients to plot the relationship between CP and customer participation enjoyment at low levels (one standard deviation below the mean) and high levels (one standard deviation above the mean) of customer SE, customer OE, employee SE, and employee OE. As the left-hand side of <ref type="figure" coords="12,387.26,175.43,32.76,16.27">Figure 2</ref>, Panel A, shows, CP is positively related to customer participation enjoyment when both customer SE and customer OE are high; however, it is negatively related to customer participation enjoyment when both customer SE and customer OE are low (right-hand side).

This finding implies that incongruence only attenuates the effect of CP, to the point that customers derive no enjoyment from their participation in the service process. We thus cannot confirm H 5 ; it might be that high customer SE motivated customers to exert more effort in their participation and evoked higher enjoyment, which offset the negative effect on enjoyment due to role expectancy violation of the employees.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The prevailing focus of CP research on the cocreation of utilitarian values and the sole impact of SE fails to recognize other benefits associated with the psychological experience and the interplay of efficacy beliefs between customers and employees, and thus it precludes the exploration of strategies designed to manage and/or influence customers' and employees' efficacy beliefs for the effective cocreation of hedonic or intrinsic values through CP. This study aims to complement extant research by ascertaining the effectiveness of CP for both customers and service employees from an experiential perspective. It applies the concept of flow and adopts the theoretical framework of relational efficacy beliefs to guide the development of hypotheses to test the cocreation of enjoyment for customers and employees through CP conditional on their separate and joint efficacies of participation. In doing so, this study further contributes to both the CP and efficacy literature streams by examining the synergistic effects of SE and OE, including congruence and incongruence levels of these efficacy beliefs, in close relationships <ref type="bibr" coords="14,197.32,273.20,92.46,16.27" target="#b63">(Lent and Lopez 2002)</ref>. The finding that these relational efficacy beliefs, as boundary conditions, separately and jointly affect the cocreation of enjoyment for both customers and employees is instrumental for identifying strategies to enhance the benefits of CP. We find that a high level of SE helps create a positive relationship between CP and participation enjoyment for customers and employees, whereas such a positive relationship does not emerge when SE is low. This moderating effect of SE on the relationship between CP and participation enjoyment is arguably more significant than its role as an antecedent to CP, because enjoyment of participation provides important cocreated values that affect both customer and employee satisfaction. Customers and employees with more confidence in their capabilities to participate in the service cocreation process perceive more value from CP, feel more comfortable, and are more willing to put more effort into overcoming difficulties or obstacles encountered than those with low SE.</p><p>Customers' OE beliefs also explain unique variance in their participation enjoyment, beyond that explained by their SE alone. Clients who believe that their financial advisers have a high level of efficacy to respond to their participation enjoy the service process more. Clients' perceived efficacy of their financial advisers also complements their own SE in determining whether they derive enjoyment from their participation, which highlights the importance of assessing customers' OE beliefs when studying CP.</p><p>Customers and employees derive the most (least) enjoyment from CP when both partners possess congruent high (low) levels of SE and OE. Because the cocreation of value is a universal, key benefit of CP <ref type="bibr" coords="14,200.47,644.72,93.56,16.27;14,53.99,656.33,21.53,16.27">(Chan, Yim, and Lam 2010)</ref>, our results confirm expectations that the maximum value of CP arises only if both customers and employees have confidence in themselves and their partners and can work together in service production and delivery. If customers and employees instead are inefficacious and feel the same way about their partners, they probably should not 134 / Journal of Marketing, November 2012 engage in participation; they are not likely to enjoy and may even be dissatisfied with their experience.</p><p>Incongruent appraisals of SE and OE, however, can work in some circumstances. Incongruent but complementary efficacy beliefs, such as when customers perceive low SE and high OE or employees perceive high SE and low OE, can enable both partners to derive enjoyment from CP. Incongruent levels of SE and OE also induce asymmetric effects when the dyad members (e.g., client-financial adviser) perform different tasks and assume different roles. If customers and employees still enjoy CP because one partner's high efficacy compensates for the other partner's low efficacy, both parties' perceptions of capabilities should validate, rather than violate, their expectations of role scripts. In the context of financial services, clients expect professional guidance and advice from their financial advisers, so their perceptions of their partner's efficacy are critical for determining their participation enjoyment. In contrast, financial advisers should have more expertise in providing financial services and be less reliant on their clients to sustain their participation enjoyment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial Implications</head><p>Confirming the significant role of enjoyment in CP and the importance of managing both customers' and employees' SE and OE offers new opportunities to enhance value cocreation by engaging customers and employees in service coproduction. Our findings suggest several implications for service companies to maximize the cocreation of values through CP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adopt a holistic view of value cocreation through CP.</head><p>Creating a positive experience in participation is especially important because it affects customer satisfaction and other consequential outcomes <ref type="bibr" coords="14,416.54,418.71,141.53,16.27" target="#b80">(Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,318.00,430.21,92.83,16.27" target="#b98">Vargo and Lusch 2004)</ref>; however, relying on the cocreation of utilitarian values alone is unlikely to work satisfactorily (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,343.87,453.21,49.10,16.27" target="#b45">Etgar 2008)</ref>. Managers who want to successfully involve customers in participation should also explore opportunities for creating experiential or hedonic values and ascertain the relative importance of various motivational drivers that contribute to customer satisfaction as a result of their participation in the service process.</p><p>Help customers cultivate enjoyable experience from their participation. Customer participation could be viewed as a new task for both customers and employees, in which enjoyment could be cultivated by providing training or education about their new roles and responsibilities <ref type="bibr" coords="14,532.10,572.29,25.90,16.27;14,318.00,583.79,21.53,16.27" target="#b57">(Jones 1986)</ref>. Recruiting employees who are more customer oriented would help because they are more likely to show a commitment to responding to customers' participation for its own sake <ref type="bibr" coords="14,373.45,618.29,80.02,16.27" target="#b8">(Brown et al. 2002)</ref>. However, recruiting for attitude may not be sufficient unless training for skills is implemented in parallel to enhance employees' skills in handling customers' participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foster customers' (and employees') SE of participation.</head><p>Both customers' and employees' SE of participation are domain-specific, task-based motivational beliefs rather than personality traits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,422.79,702.87,135.26,16.27;14,318.00,714.37,21.76,16.27" target="#b41">Dierdorff, Surface, and Brown 2010)</ref>; therefore, they can be changed or influenced. In line with the fields of counseling and psychotherapy, founded on the premise of influencing clients' efficacy beliefs, service firms wanting to improve the effectiveness of CP could formulate strategies to either add to customers' and employees' perceived competence and capabilities to participate or design the service process in such a way that customers and employees are still able to participate in cocreation efficiently and effectively even without congruent high levels of efficacy <ref type="bibr" coords="15,88.77,127.42,62.74,16.27" target="#b23">(Bandura 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,154.26,127.42,46.08,16.27" target="#b28">Beck 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,203.09,127.42,80.04,16.27" target="#b94">Strecher et al. 1986)</ref>.

Firms could hold regular investment seminars to provide opportunities for novice customers to learn from experienced investors to gradually take on a value cocreator role.

Employees could also help bolster customers' SE through positive verbal persuasion (e.g., "You did a great job") because self-appraisals often form in response to the evaluative reactions of significant others, particularly in more complex, interpersonal contexts in which social cues are salient indicators of performance <ref type="bibr" coords="15,54.00,334.60,62.74,16.27" target="#b23">(Bandura 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,119.49,334.60,87.54,16.27" target="#b63">Lent and Lopez 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Similar methods could be used to bolster employees' SE.

Customers derive less enjoyment from working with employees they perceive as inefficacious. A high level of customers' OE also helps compensate for customers' own perceptions of inefficacy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do Customers and Employees Enjoy Service Participation? / 135</head><p>Redesign job to match customers' and employees' efficacy. Ideally, firms should match customers and employees with high SE and OE to produce maximum mutual participation enjoyment. Firms should also facilitate continuous collaborations between these matched customer-employee dyads and avoid job rotations that contribute to their breakup. Assigning only employees with high levels of SE to serve actively participating customers, regardless of their level of efficacy belief, could be another effective strategy and promote mutual participation enjoyment for both parties. For example, banks could assign tasks that require more active CP, such as asset/fund management, to more efficacious employees and assign counter services to less efficacious employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Further Research</head><p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results and designing further research. First, we examine the cocreation of participation enjoyment and the moderating role of relational efficacy beliefs in a particular type of close relationship (i.e., client-financial adviser dyads); further research should explore similarities and differences in results across service contexts. Systematic differences would offer an opportunity to identify boundary conditions of our proposed framework and hypotheses. Second, although enjoyment is a relevant positive, affective experience created through CP in financial services <ref type="bibr" coords="15,513.67,335.00,44.35,16.27;15,318.00,346.50,61.67,16.27" target="#b18">(Allen and McGoun 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,383.01,346.50,141.12,16.27" target="#b80">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,527.47,346.50,30.55,16.27;15,318.00,358.00,80.82,16.27" target="#b88">Sharma and Patterson 1999)</ref>, other experiential or hedonic values, such as excitement, are also likely to emerge and await exploration in service contexts. Third, SE and OE are firstorder efficacy perceptions and arguably have more direct effects in close relationships. Further research should investigate the roles of other second-order perceptions and ascertain their relationships to SE and OE to contribute to a fuller understanding of their nature within dyadic contexts. Fourth, further research could enrich the measurements of the ultimate behavioral outcomes for both customers and employees by adopting multi-item measures. Finally, this research adopts a cross-sectional survey approach to study the role of efficacy in CP. Longitudinal designs would be valuable for understanding the development of relational efficacy beliefs over the long lifespan of dyads to allow for inferences of causality with respect to SE and OE and the direction of the theorized relationships, such as the impact of enjoyment on customers' future level of participation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,282.81,332.56,46.40,17.35;3,250.58,344.61,110.86,17.35"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>'()*+$9*.%+-:#&amp;*$ ;/'*/',(7(4$&amp;'+*&amp;&amp; 4 $ ! 9*3#',(/#3$&gt;#3%* 4 $ !%&amp;'()*+=$ ! 0-(/(),-$&gt;#3%* # $ ! 9*3#',(/#3$&gt;#3%* # $ a Responses recorded from customers. b Responses recorded from service employees. c Responses recorded from supervisors.
