<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>According to the dual-process model of moral judgment, utilitarian responses to moral conflict draw on limited cognitive resources. Terror Management Theory, in parallel, postulates that mortality salience mobilizes these resources to suppress thoughts of death out of focal attention. Consequently, we predicted that individuals under mortality salience would be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. Two experiments corroborated this hypothesis. Experiment 1 showed that utilitarian responses to non-lethal harm conflicts were less frequent when participants were reminded of their mortality. Experiment 2 showed that the detrimental effect of mortality salience on utilitarian conflict judgments was comparable to that of an extreme concurrent cognitive load. These findings raise the question of whether private judgment and public debate about controversial moral issues might be shaped by mortality salience effects, since these issues (e.g., assisted suicide) often involve matters of life and death.</p></div>

Contexts that deprive an individual of these resources will therefore disrupt effortful processing, and affect inferences, judgments and decisions. In this article, we investigate the specific context of mortality salience (being reminded of one's own mortality) on moral judgment. Besides its theoretical interest, this issue is important because moral conflicts may often involve issues of life and death, which can remind individuals of their own mortality.</p></div>

These two responses can conflict, as in the famous Footbridge dilemma <ref type="bibr" coords="1,455.46,575.98,47.66,7.53;1,281.93,586.46,45.59,7.53" target="#b38">(Thomson &amp; Parent, 1986</ref>):</p><p>A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The current research</head><p>In this article, we examine whether a mortality salience context (in which individuals are reminded of their physical mortality) makes moral judgments less utilitarian on moral dilemmas such as the Footbridge problem. Based on the assumption that mortality salience compromises the availability of cognitive resources, we predict that individuals under mortality salience will be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. We also predict that mortality salience will have no comparable effect on control scenarios wherein the utilitarian response does not conflict with an intuitive response. In a first experiment, we manipulate mortality salience by having participants think about death (vs. pain) before they read nonlethal harm scenarios. In a second experiment, we attempt to establish the extent to which Mortality Salience taps on cognitive resources, by comparing its effect on utilitarian responses to that of several levels of cognitive load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiment 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Method</head><p>The 85 participants (59 women; mean age = 22.00, SD = 3.94) were recruited on campus at the University of Toulouse. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions of the mortality salience manipulation. Immediately after they were done with the mortality salience manipulation, participants judged the moral acceptability of the target action in the harm-conflict and harmcontrol versions of our two scenarios (that is, they read a total of four scenarios). The order in which scenarios appeared was counterbalanced across participants (eight different versions of the questionnaire were constructed).</p><p>To manipulate mortality salience, we used a French translation of the classic manipulation of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,446.40,671.90,61.01,7.53;2,286.24,682.39,23.11,7.53" target="#b19">Greenberg et al. (1990)</ref>. Participants in the Death condition had to briefly respond to the two following questions: 'Briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you' and 'Jot down, as specifically as you can, what you think will happen to you physically as you die and once you are physically dead'. Participants in the Pain condition responded to similarly phrased questions about extreme pain. Extreme pain was chosen as a control in order to rule out the possibility that an effect in the Death condition might be due to aversive emotions.</p><p>Our moral scenarios were adapted from the high conflict moral dilemmas used in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,157.89,159.29,79.11,7.53" target="#b22">Greene et al. (2004)</ref>, but framed with a non-lethal harm content in order to avoid to trigger mortality salience in our control pain group. Conflict scenarios were such that the utilitarian response conflicted with an intuitive deontic response. In the control version of the scenarios, the utilitarian response was congruent with the intuitive, deontic response. For example, the conflict version of the Crying Baby scenario read:</p><p>Leo is a civilian during war. He and his six children are hidden in the cellar of their house. If the enemy sees them, they will all be captured and tortured. The youngest child is still a baby. Enemy soldiers are searching the house when the baby starts to cry. Leo puts his hand over the baby's mouth so that the noise does not attract the enemy soldiers' attention. The only possibility for Leo not to get caught with his children is to leave his hand on the baby's mouth, which will deprive him of air for a few minutes and will have serious consequences on his mental and respiratory systems.</p><p>Is it morally acceptable that Leo decides to smother his baby in order to save his five other children?</p><p>In the control version of the scenario, the action that Leo could take to save everyone from torture was to give the baby a pacifier.</p><p>In addition to the Crying Baby scenario, the experiment used a Captive Soldier scenario with a comparable structure. These two scenarios were selected based on a pretest conducted with 58 independent participants. This online pretest assessed the moral acceptability of the target action of eight non-lethal harm conflict and non-lethal harm control scenarios. In order to avoid floor effects (since we predict that mortality salience will decrease moral acceptability), we retained from this pre-test the two scenarios whose conflict version had an acceptability of at least 50%. In both cases, the acceptability of the control version was about 100%. <ref type="figure" coords="3,48.47,588.22,20.02,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> displays the percentage of utilitarian responses in the Pain and Death conditions, for control and conflict problems. Visual inspection suggests that utilitarian responses were more frequent for control problems, which is unsurprising. More importantly, it also suggests the expected effect of mortality salience on conflict problems: Utilitarian responses were less frequent on conflict problems when participants were under mortality salience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results</head><p>An analysis of variance confirmed that utilitarian responses were less frequent overall for conflict problems, Fð1; 83Þ ¼ 87:46; p &lt; :001; g 2 p ¼ :51. More importantly, the analysis detected a significant interaction effect, Fð1; 83Þ ¼ 6:89; p ¼ :01; g 2 p ¼ :08. This interaction supported our prediction that mortality salience would decrease the frequency of utilitarian responses to conflict problems, t(83) = 3.03, p = .003, but not to control problems, t(83) = 1.04, p = .30. Participants who were reminded of their future death before the experiments were less likely to give utilitarian responses on conflict problems, even when these problems did not involve to kill in order to save lives, but to harm in order to protect others from harm.</p><p>In our second experiment, we seek to assess the amount of cognitive resources consumed by mortality salience, by comparing its effect to that of several levels of cognitive load. As we already mentioned, proponents of the dualprocess approach to moral judgment observed an effect of cognitive load on utilitarian response latencies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,473.21,392.01,29.90,7.53;3,281.93,402.44,41.95,7.53" target="#b21">(Greene et al., 2008)</ref>. However, these authors failed to find an effect of cognitive load on the frequency of utilitarian responses, and hypothesized that their manipulation of load might not have been powerful enough to evoke this effect. Given that we do observe this effect with a mortality salience manipulation, we hypothesize that mortality salience might be the equivalent of a very high cognitive load. This is what we seek to confirm in Experiment 2.</p></div>

Notably, the effect of mortality salience appears to be comparable to that of very high load: Mortality salience decreases the frequency of utilitarian responses by about 20 points, just as does very high load.</p><p>We performed an ANOVA with the percentage of utilitarian responses to conflict problems as the dependant variable, the independent variables being cognitive load and the mortality salience condition. First, the analysis detected a main effect of mortality salience, Fð1; 110Þ ¼ 8:04; p ¼ :005; g 2 p ¼ :07. Second, the analysis detected a main effect of cognitive load,</p><p>Fð2; 110Þ ¼ 6:03; p ¼ :003; g 2 p ¼ :10. Specifically, post hoc t-test analysis did not detect any difference between the low and high load conditions but detected a significant difference between low load and very high load (p = .023), as well as between high load and very high load (p = .005). As it is visually clear in <ref type="figure" coords="4,367.37,593.61,19.25,7.53" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, the analysis did not detect an interaction between cognitive load and mortality salience, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>We predicted and experimentally demonstrated that individuals under mortality salience would be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. Utilitarian   responses were less likely if participants considered their own death before responding to a harm-based conflict.</p><p>We also compared the effect of mortality salience to that of different levels of cognitive load, and found that it was comparable to a very high load level. This also allowed us to demonstrate an heretofore unobserved effect of cognitive load on utilitarian responses, confirming that previous failures to obtain the effect were likely due to too weak a manipulation of load. This last finding is consistent with the hypothesis that counterintuitive utilitarian responses do not require to mobilize a vast amount of cognitive resources, although they do imply some measure of cognitive effort <ref type="bibr" coords="5,228.13,180.26,29.90,7.53;5,36.85,190.69,44.39,7.53" target="#b21">(Greene et al., 2008)</ref>. It thus take a high degree of cognitive load to impact on the likelihood of a utilitarian response on a Footbridge-type problem, as shown in Experiment 2. This high degree of cognitive load, however, seems readily achieved by mortality salience. In our own research on mortality salience and reasoning biases <ref type="bibr" coords="5,190.37,243.02,67.65,7.53;5,36.85,253.45,19.87,7.53" target="#b39">(Trémolière et al., 2012)</ref>, we already observed that the effect of mortality salience seemed at least twice that of a standard dot matrix task. The current results further support the contention that mortality salience puts cognitive resources under very significant duress, with predictable consequences on a broad range of high-level mental activities.</p><p>Other explanations of our findings could be considered, though, that would be consistent with a dual-process approach to moral reasoning without committing to the notion that mortality salience mobilizes cognitive resources. One possibility is that rather than depriving people of cognitive resources, mortality salience has a motivational effect, encouraging people to switch from an analytic to an intuitive, experiential mindset ). Another possibility is that mortality salience makes people more emotional (and thus less utilitarian), independently of any effect on their cognitive resources. Some data, though, would speak against both explanations. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,216.91,431.30,41.15,7.53;5,36.85,441.73,46.36,7.53" target="#b39">Trémolière et al. (2012)</ref> did not find any evidence that a switch to an experiential mode of processing mediated the effect of mortality salience on reasoning biases, and mortality salience has regularly been found not to trigger increased emotional arousal <ref type="bibr" coords="5,119.73,483.57,138.34,7.53;5,36.85,494.05,109.52,7.53" target="#b33">(Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Lyon, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,151.37,494.05,106.71,7.53;5,36.85,504.49,19.85,7.53" target="#b0">Arndt, Allen, &amp; Greenberg, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Another interpretation of our findings would consider that whenever mortality concerns are made salient, the emphasis on moral values will get stronger, at the expense of rational, utilitarian calculations, because these values are a component of people's existential anxiety buffers. Previous studies showed for example that mortality salience increased negative reactions to moral transgressors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,57.37,588.22,105.65,7.53" target="#b14">Florian &amp; Mikulincer, 1997)</ref> because it led people to increase alignment to their moral values. In that sense, our effects would not necessarily be mediated by the mobilization of cognitive resources, since they could involve the second line of defense of the dual-process model of terror management theory. Note though that these previous results were obtained after a delay or distraction task, specifically aimed at prompting this second line of defense. Our protocol intentionally avoided this delay or distraction in order to focus on the first line of defense, which terror management theory assumes to mobilize cognitive resources. Our findings are thus consistent with the dualprocess specification of terror management theory, but we must acknowledge that they cannot on their own rule out a uni-process account of the effect of mortality salience on moral judgment.</p><p>Irrespective of the precise processing specification underlying the effect of mortality salience, our findings have worrying implications for public debate (and private judgments) about controversial moral issues. We now know that mortality salience may prevent people from giving their full cognitive attention to moral conflicts, and it is arguably the case that many controversial moral issues which have entered the public debate (e.g., assisted suicide), involve matters of life and death. Our findings raise the worrying question of whether private judgment and public debates about these issues might be shaped by mortality salience effects, rather than by a full reflective attention to the available arguments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,281.93,169.64,221.18,6.03;3,281.93,178.21,221.14,6.03;3,281.93,186.82,58.42,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Percentage of utilitarian responses in the pain and death thought groups, for control and conflict problems.
