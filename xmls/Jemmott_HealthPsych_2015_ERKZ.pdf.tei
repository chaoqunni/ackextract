<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective: Little research has tested HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk-reduction interventions' effects on early adolescents as they age into middle and late adolescence. This study tested whether intervention-induced reductions in unprotected intercourse during a 12-month period endured over a 54-month period and whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of STIs, which increase risk for HIV. Method: Grade 6 learners (mean age ϭ 12.4 years) participated in a 12-month trial in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, in which 9 matched pairs of schools were randomly selected and within pairs randomized to a theory-based HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention or an attention-control intervention. They completed 42and 54-month postintervention measures of unprotected intercourse (the primary outcome), other sexual behaviors, theoretical constructs, and, at 42-and 54-month follow-up only, biologically confirmed curable STIs (chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis) and herpes simplex virus 2. Results: The HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention reduced unprotected intercourse averaged over the entire follow-up period (OR ϭ 0.42, 95% CI [0.22, 0.84]), an effect not significantly reduced at 42-and 54-month follow-up compared with 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. The intervention caused positive changes on theoretical constructs averaged over the 5 follow-ups, although most effects weakened at long-term follow-up. Although the intervention's main effect on STIs was nonsignificant, an Intervention Condition ϫ Time interaction revealed that it significantly reduced curable STIs at 42-month follow-up in adolescents who reported sexual experience. Conclusion: These results suggest that theory-based behavioral interventions with early adolescents can have long-lived effects in the context of a generalized severe HIV epidemic.</p></div>

A cluster RCT of the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention Let Us Protect Our Future with Grade 6 learners (mean age ϭ 12.4 years) found that those in the intervention schools had lower odds of reporting vaginal intercourse, unprotected vaginal intercourse, and multiple partners during the 12-month postintervention period compared with an attention-matched control group (J.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Institutional Review Board 8 at the University of Pennsylvania, the designated institutional review board under the federal-wide assurances of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Fort Hare, South Africa, approved the study. The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand approved the laboratory testing undertaken at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. We conducted the study in an urban township and a neighboring semirural settlement in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Schools serving Grade 6 learners from the general population were eligible. Of 36 schools serving Grade 6 learners in the catchment area, one serving children with learning disabilities was ineligible, leaving 35 eligible schools; all agreed to participate. From 17 matched pairs of schools similar in numbers of Grade 6 learners, classrooms, and classrooms with electricity, including one "pair" consisting of three schools, we randomly selected nine.</p><p>We used a cluster RCT design, reducing the potential for contamination between treatment arms that would be present were individuals randomized. We enrolled schools over 13 months beginning in October 2004 and used computer-generated random number sequences to randomize, within pairs, one school to the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention and one to the control group. Recruiters, following a standardized scripted recruitment protocol, announced the study at the schools and distributed cover letters and parent/guardian consent forms to Grade 6 learners. During recruitment, school personnel, potential participants, and recruiters were masked to the schools' randomized intervention assignment. The nature of the intervention precluded masking the facilitators and participants to the group assignment during the interventions.</p></div>

Each intervention included 12 modules, each lasting 1 hr, with two modules delivered during each of six sessions on consecutive school days. Sessions involved games, brainstorming, role-playing, group discussions, and comic workbooks with a series of characters and storylines. Using standardized manuals, male and female adult cofacilitators implemented each intervention in mixed-sex small groups of nine to 16 adolescents. Twenty-one women and 22 men ages 27-56 years (M ϭ 42 years) bilingual in English and Xhosa served as cofacilitators (L. S. . Fifty percent had a bachelor's degree, 65% previously worked as teachers, and 63% previously taught HIV education.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>We enrolled in the trial Grade 6 learners who completed the preintervention questionnaire and attended Session 1 of the intervention. They completed immediate-post and 3-, 6-, and 12-month postintervention questionnaires by December 2006. The initial informed-consent process covered activities through the 12-month follow-up. Accordingly, we located the learners, then attending more than 200 secondary schools, and gave them parent/guardian consent forms and cover letters explaining the continuation of the trial and inviting their parents or guardians to a meeting where they could ask questions about the follow-up study.</p><p>We began 42-month data collection in April 2008 and completed 54-month data collection in June 2010. As compensation, learners received a notebook, a pen, and a pencil for the 3-month follow-up; a T-shirt for the 6-month follow-up; a backpack for the 12-month follow-up; an umbrella (if female) or a cap (if male) for the 42-month follow-up; and a jacket for the 54-month follow-up. We held the intervention and data collection sessions except the 42-and 54-month follow-ups at the learners' schools during the extracurricular period at the end of the school day. We held the 42and 54-month follow-ups on Saturdays at one of the 18 schools, a centrally located school with suitable plumbing facilities; transportation was provided to the sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The primary outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the learner reported having unprotected vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months. We defined vaginal intercourse as "your penis in a female's vagina" (male version) or "a boy's penis in your vagina" (female version). We coded the responses 1 for learners reporting not having vaginal sex or using a condom during vaginal sex and 2 for those reporting vaginal sex without using a condom. Secondary behavioral outcomes included sexual experience (i.e., whether they ever had vaginal sex) and behaviors in the past 3 months: vaginal sex, multiple partners, heterosexual anal sex, consistent condom use, frequency of condom use, condom use at last sex, and talking to parents about condoms and about not having sex.

The attenuation of the intervention's effects on some behavioral outcomes after more than 4 years is perhaps not surprising; the durability of its effects on unprotected vaginal sex, heterosexual anal sex, and talking to parents about not having sex is surprising. In this connection, some might argue that the intervention, based on a Western theoretical model, socialcognitive theory, implemented in sub-Saharan Africa, would have little effect on behavior. Contrary to this, its effects were similar to those in a meta-analytic review of HIV risk-reduction interventions with adolescents, although none of the trials reviewed had a follow-up as long as 54 months postintervention <ref type="bibr" coords="9,228.88,451.04,59.16,7.91;9,48.00,462.04,150.58,7.91" target="#b20">(Johnson, Scott-Sheldon, Huedo-Medina, &amp; Carey, 2011)</ref>. The intervention also had a significant effect averaged over the postintervention period on each theoretical construct. Moreover, its effects on several of them, including condom use hedonistic outcome expectancy, condom use technical skills, expected parent approval of sex, self-efficacy to refuse sex, and self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations, did not decrease at long-term compared with short-term follow-up. Interestingly, two of these theoretical constructs, expected parent approval of sex and selfefficacy to avoid sexual risk situations, mediated the intervention's efficacy over the first 12 months postintervention <ref type="bibr" coords="9,231.63,572.04,56.44,7.91;9,48.00,583.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b24">(O'Leary et al., 2012)</ref>. That effects on these constructs endured may well account for the continued efficacy of the intervention, a possibility that future mediation analyses must explore.</p><p>In the planned analysis on learners reporting sexual experience, the intervention did not reduce curable STIs or HSV-2 averaged over the 42-and 54-month follow-ups. However, its effect on curable STIs differed significantly at the two follow-ups. It reduced curable STIs 42 months, but not 54 months, postintervention. Reducing STIs is important because having an STI increases the risk of coinfection with HIV <ref type="bibr" coords="9,172.54,682.04,111.64,7.91" target="#b8">(Fleming &amp; Wasserheit, 1999)</ref>. STIs detected 42 months postintervention are a measure of prevalence because when the learners contracted the STIs is unknown. In contrast, STIs detected 54 months postintervention are a mea-sure of 1-year incidence because we treated all curable STIs detected 42 months postintervention. Thus, the intervention had an effect on curable STIs sometime between the intervention's culmination and the 42-month assessment, an effect that did not persist sufficiently to affect STI incidence at 54-month follow-up.

The present study in which only 3.3% of young adolescents reported sexual experience before the intervention (J.

The adolescents who received the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention were less likely to report unprotected vaginal sex during a 54month postintervention period than were their counterparts in the control group, a finding suggesting that intervening with adolescents before they are sexually active is salubrious, causing reductions in their sexual risks.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the attention-matched control group, random selection of schools, long-term follow-up, high retention rates, biological markers, generalized epidemic setting, and the cluster RCT design, which increased internal validity while decreasing risk of contamination between arms. The use of selfreports is a limitation. The fact that some learners reporting no sexual experience tested positive for STI suggests socially desir-able responding, but the significant relation between self-reported sexual experience and STIs 42 and 54 months postintervention reassures that results were not entirely due to socially desirable responding. Moreover, the robust and consistent results for intervention effects on theoretical constructs lend credence to the validity of the data. The intervention reduced unprotected vaginal sex, but did not increase condom use. Analyses of the intervention's effects on condom use had less power than did analyses on other outcomes: Data from the first three follow-ups were excluded from the condom use analyses because too few learners reported having sex, as were data from learners who did not report sex at 42-month or 54-month follow-up, whereas analyses on other outcomes included all learners, irrespective of whether they had sex. Therefore, we may have underestimated the intervention's effects on condom use. Another limitation is that the results may not generalize to all South African adolescents. Unknown is whether the intervention would continue to be efficacious if implemented by teachers in classrooms across South Africa. A challenge for the future is whether the characteristics of the interven- Note.

Nonetheless, the fact that adolescents who received only 12 hr of intervention in Grade 6, when few reported sexually experience, retained risk-reduction knowledge, self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies and were continuing to engage in safer sexual behavior during a 54-month follow-up period is quite extraordinary. The HIV epidemic is having devastating effects in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV. These results indicate that intervening early, before the initiation of sexual activity, can have long-lasting effects on behavior-necessary effects should we hope to see an AIDS-free generation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,117.00,456.01,360.02,7.03;7,117.00,466.01,64.05,7.03"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Progress of participating schools and Grade 6 learners through the trial, Mdantsane and Berlin, South Africa, 2004 -2010.</figDesc></figure>

Manuscript reviewers are vital to the publications process. As a reviewer, you would gain valuable experience in publishing. The P&amp;C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process.</p><p>If you are interested in reviewing manuscripts, please write APA Journals at Reviewers@apa.org. Please note the following important points:</p><p>• To be selected as a reviewer, you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough, objective review.</p><p>• To be selected, it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review. Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research.</p><p>• To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript, the editor needs detailed information. Please include with your letter your vita. In the letter, please identify which APA journal(s) you are interested in, and describe your area of expertise. Be as specific as possible. For example, "social psychology" is not sufficient-you would need to specify "social cognition" or "attitude change" as well.</p><p>• Reviewing a manuscript takes time (1-4 hours per manuscript reviewed). If you are selected to review a manuscript, be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly.</p><p>APA now has an online video course that provides guidance in reviewing manuscripts. To learn more about the course and to access the video, visit http://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/reviewmanuscript-ce-video.aspx.
