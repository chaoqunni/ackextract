<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Conspicuous consumption may be explained by the need to signal higher social status in a society. However, whether this consumption actually translates to improved perception of well-being remains unexamined. In the emerging economy context, we argue that conspicuous consumption may play the role of elevating one's own perception of economic well-being. Further we hypothesize the effect to be higher for the households in the 'bottom of the pyramid' (BOP). Using data from a panel of 34,621 households from India Human Development Surveys (2004 and 2011), we examine the relationship between conspicuous consumption and subjective economic well-being (SEWB) using several empirical strategies. Results support our hypotheses that higher conspicuous consumption may result in improved SEWB and that the effect is higher for households in the BOP. Our findings contribute to the domain of conspicuous consumption and BOP in emerging markets. Further, our results have significant marketing and policy implications.</p></div>

However as evidence of conspicuous consumption emerges from low income populations <ref type="bibr" coords="1,224.78,478.87,63.88,7.17;1,37.59,489.36,19.32,7.17" target="#b3">(Banerjee &amp; Duflo, 2011)</ref>, it ceases to be an issue only of academic interest, attracting attention from policy makers and practitioners as well. Why is it that the "poor", who might be expected to spend more on basic necessities, divert expenditure to goods and services that appear to be exhibitionist and unproductive? An underlying explanation in previous inquiries has been the subjective utility (perceptual in nature, and may not be related to objective utility) that consumers derive from conspicuous consumption, based on their perceptions of status <ref type="bibr" coords="1,213.61,562.55,75.02,7.17" target="#b56">(Powdthavee, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,37.59,573.04,88.65,7.17" target="#b60">Roychowdhury, 2017)</ref> and relative positions in society <ref type="bibr" coords="1,37.59,583.47,88.51,7.17" target="#b34">(Jaikumar &amp; Sarin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,129.26,583.47,69.10,7.17" target="#b67">van Kempen, 2003)</ref>. Although promising, in the absence of measures of subjective economic well-being, the explanation is also not one that is very easily amendable to empirical examination, especially in emerging economies like India.</p><p>Conspicuous consumption is defined as the use of resources to consume goods with the objective of displaying one's high social status to others <ref type="bibr" coords="1,75.80,646.23,53.57,7.17" target="#b69">(Veblen, 1899)</ref>. Households may indulge in conspicuous consumption to reduce the dissatisfaction arising from their current level of possessions in comparison to their peers and to 'keep up with the Joneses' <ref type="bibr" coords="1,350.42,426.54,92.59,7.17" target="#b10">(Christen &amp; Morgan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,444.93,426.54,43.65,7.17" target="#b25">Frank, 1985)</ref>. Hence households may feel economically healthy when they are able and willing to signal higher social status via conspicuous consumption. As a result, although considered wasteful from one perspective, conspicuous consumption might play a role in the perceived economic well-being of the household, a dimension of welfare that is increasingly being recognized and studied.</p><p>This increased attention to the determinants of subjective economic well-being stems primarily from challenges to the assumption that economic growth leads to better welfare (eg. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,469.76,520.71,55.37,7.17" target="#b49">McBride, 2001)</ref> and that the "happiness" of a country may not be associated with its economic growth, a paradox labeled as the 'Easterlin paradox' <ref type="bibr" coords="1,498.33,541.63,55.29,7.17" target="#b20">(Easterlin, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.60,552.12,16.11,7.17" target="#b21">(Easterlin, , 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,331.65,552.12,15.46,7.17" target="#b22">(Easterlin, , 2001</ref>. Possible explanations have pointed to the idea that members of a society are more concerned about relative (rather than absolute) wealth levels, i.e., 'keeping up with the Joneses' or outdoing them <ref type="bibr" coords="1,326.50,583.47,92.59,7.17" target="#b10">(Christen &amp; Morgan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,421.00,583.47,108.29,7.17" target="#b12">Clark, Frijters, &amp; Shields, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,531.27,583.47,26.37,7.17;1,306.60,593.95,20.14,7.17" target="#b42">Layard, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,331.37,593.95,55.56,7.17" target="#b49">McBride, 2001)</ref>. Recent studies in emerging economies also suggest that households are likely to rely on conspicuous consumption to signal higher status in a society, especially when income inequality levels are higher (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,384.38,625.31,83.67,7.17" target="#b34">Jaikumar &amp; Sarin, 2015)</ref>. However, what remains under examined is the extent to which conspicuous consumption actually translates to higher subjective economic well-being.</p><p>The limited studies examining this relationship primarily use cross-sectional data and/or small scale data sets restricted to small geographies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,60.21,70.23,140.53,7.17" target="#b45">(Linssen, Kempen, &amp; Kraaykamp, 2011)</ref>, with the evidence remaining inconclusive. We contribute to the literature by using a nationally representative panel data set from India to estimate the relationship between the consumption of such conspicuous products and changes in the perception of one's economic well-being. Using an unique panel dataset of 36,421 Indian households from 2004 and 2011 India Human Development Survey (henceforth IHDS), we find that higher levels of conspicuous consumption are associated with increased perceptions of subjective economic well-being and that this effect is even more pronounced among households in the 'bottom of the pyramid' (henceforth BOP). We believe that the findings from our study pose a number of challenges and opportunities to marketers and policymakers alike, in emerging markets. The rest of the paper is organized into five sections. First, we provide a brief background on economic growth and subjective wellbeing in India. We argue that conspicuous consumption might result in an improved sense of economic well-being, as these households are better able to signal higher social status and are able to 'keep up with the Joneses'. Second, based on the key characteristics of the 'bottom of the pyramid' in emerging economies, we hypothesize the effect to be higher for the low-income households. Third, we explain the IHDS panel dataset and few of its unique features that help us in examining the relationship of interest. Fourth, we present the empirical strategies followed to test the hypotheses and then discuss the results. Finally, we explain the marketing and policy implications of our findings.</p></div>

An implicit assumption in these explanations is that while conspicuous consumption may not be productive from a material or a basic needs perspective, it serves to improve the subjective economic well-being of the consumers and hence the indulgence in it. However, this is an assumption that has received limited empirical examination. A plausible reason for the lack of empirical studies is the relatively recent attention that the idea of subjective economic well-being has received in studying human welfare.</p><p>While quantifying welfare has been a long-standing topic of interest <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.60,59.80,118.16,7.17" target="#b18">(Dolan, Peasgood, &amp; White, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.12,59.80,53.34,7.17" target="#b49">McBride, 2001)</ref>, the last few decades has seen a marked attention to self-reported 'happiness' or subjective well-being (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,364.08,80.72,54.93,7.17" target="#b22">Easterlin, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,422.87,78.93,3.36,4.78">1</ref> A key finding in the subjective wellbeing literature is that the extent of economic growth in a society may not be associated with overall 'happiness' of the members of the society <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.60,112.07,59.63,7.17" target="#b21">(Easterlin, 1995)</ref>. According to the 'Easterlin paradox', "raising the incomes of all, does not increase the happiness of all, because the positive effect of higher income on SWB [subjective well-being] is offset by the negative effect of higher living level norms brought about by the growth in incomes generally" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,415.16,153.91,82.12,7.17">(Easterlin, 1995, p. 36)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Conspicuous consumption in the 'bottom of the pyramid'</head><p>The literature on 'keeping up with the Joneses' and 'status consumption', which links our hypothesized relationship between subjective economic well-being and conspicuous consumption, can be seen as having its origins in the relative income hypothesis proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.60,375.12,69.47,7.17" target="#b19">Duesenberry (1949)</ref>. According to Duesenberry's theory, a household's attitude towards consumption and savings are greatly influenced by the relative position in terms of the household's income, rather than by the abstract standard of living.

This suggests an increasing demand from consumers in these markets. With the growing prosperity of emerging markets, and reducing gaps with their western counterparts, welfare has become an interesting area of research. We study the relationship between conspicuous consumption and subjective economic well-being, in the context of Indian households. India, as one of the leading emerging markets, as well as world's third largest market based on purchasing power parity index (as per International Monetary Fund 2008), liberalized her economy in 1991, and since then the economy has undergone several changes in tune with the demands of globalization.</p><p>We use data from IHDS 2004 and 2011 to empirically test our hypotheses in the context of India. In 2004, the University of Maryland and the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) organized and conducted the IHDS. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 41,554 households across India, covering all the 33 states and union territories. The survey covered 1503 villages and 971 urban areas across the country. Further, the sample consists of 27,010 rural and 13,126 urban households <ref type="bibr" coords="3,266.57,603.71,22.08,7.17;3,37.59,614.19,44.72,7.17" target="#b16">(Desai et al., 2005)</ref>. In 2011, a second round of interviews (IHDS II) was conducted with a sample of 42,152 households. Majority of the households interviewed in 2004 (83%) were re-interviewed in IHDS II. Further, the second wave of IHDS covered 1420 villages and 1042 urban areas across the country <ref type="bibr" coords="3,149.33,656.03,92.63,7.17" target="#b15">(Desai &amp; Vanneman, 2011)</ref>. We merged the two surveys to create a panel of 34,621 households (69,242 observations across two time periods) for our analysis. Further, we also used the deflators specified in IHDS II to convert all amounts (income and expenses) in 2011 to 2004 values, thus creating a unique dataset that could provide rich insights into the changes at the household level.</p><p>The IHDS panel dataset has several merits over other surveys conducted in India and other emerging economies. IHDS surveys capture detailed information on the household income. Income from various sources (e.g. business, farming, salary, labor, remittances) is measured separately for each household. This enables us to identify households that are below poverty line within a state. Below poverty line households may be identified based on total income (eg. bottom 10% households in terms of income within a state) or based on income per capita (and comparing it with the official poverty line index). IHDS also reports detailed consumption information (47 categories in 2004 and 52 in 2011) at the household level, data that we use to construct our measures of conspicuous consumption. The data collected by IHDS in the two survey waves mainly capture household characteristics using questionnaire items well established in the literature <ref type="bibr" coords="3,492.09,174.83,65.56,7.17" target="#b16">(Desai et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.60,185.32,89.79,7.17" target="#b15">Desai &amp; Vanneman, 2011)</ref>. Further, IHDS dataset has been used extensively in the literature to provide empirical evidence for a wide range of research work (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,375.59,206.24,124.28,7.17" target="#b40">Khamis, Prakash, &amp; Siddique, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,501.90,206.24,55.70,7.17;3,306.60,216.67,19.32,7.17" target="#b60">Roychowdhury, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The survey captures household consumption information across 47 categories.

In line with our definition of conspicuous consumption, the 12 items meet the following two criteria: (i) be readily visible/observable by others, and (ii) create the perception that households consuming these items are, on average, economically better off than those who consume less of them <ref type="bibr" coords="3,327.23,310.83,80.72,7.17" target="#b60">(Roychowdhury, 2017)</ref>. We use the share of household expenses spent on these 12 items as a measure of visible or conspicuous consumption. Further, in 2011, the head of all households were asked: 'Compared to 7 years ago <ref type="bibr" coords="3,404.96,342.18,23.03,7.17">[2004]</ref>, would you say your household is economically doing the same, better, or worse today'. In 2004, the household heads were posed the same question, but on a 10 year margin (compared to 1994). The responses were coded as 1 -worse, 2same and 3 -better (increasing order of SEWB -recoded from original responses). We use the response to this question as our measure of SEWB and the dependent variable in our empirical analysis. Our measure of SEWB differs from other conventional measures of subjective well-being (refer Helliwell, Richard, and Jeffrey <ref type="formula" coords="3,516.48,425.92,23.89,7.17" target="#formula_0">(2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.60,436.35,68.51,7.17" target="#b18">Dolan et al.

As stated above, the question explicitly asked respondents to assess changes in their economic circumstances in subjective terms and based on their own perceptions of how well they are doing. In doing so, we believe it captures an important and distinct construct hitherto unexplored in the context of an emerging economy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical framework and results</head><p>We employ an ordered probit model to test our hypotheses using the data from the two survey waves. The rationale for selecting ordered probit regression rather than linear models (or non-linear probit regression) is that the responses to SEWB can be on three discrete levels. The three levels have a clear order (worse, same, betterincreasing order). Ordered probit models utilize this additional order information effectively in computing the likelihood of a household reporting each of these responses. Using a linear model (or a non-linear probit model) would not effectively utilize the additional embedded order information in the response to SEWB.</p><p>We utilize the panel nature of the data and compute changes in share of conspicuous consumption between 2011 and 2004. A higher change indicates that the household is willing to spend a larger portion of its consumption expenses on conspicuous items in 2011 compared to 2004. By focusing on changes in conspicuous consumption, we partly address the issue of endogeneity that higher perception of economic well-being may lead to higher conspicuous consumption. As we are examining the changes in conspicuous consumption against the perception of changes in economic well-being in 2011, we may attribute the perceived changes in SEWB reported in 2011 to the change in consumption of such goods. Further, by controlling for reported changes in SEWB in the years before 2004, we also control for any underlying differences in a household's interpretation of the SEWB measure used by us. We express the reported changes in SEWB as a function of changes in share of conspicuous consumption and other control variables and estimate the following ordered probit model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,37.47,137.27,251.18,8.70">y k κ δx δx β X β κ Pr( &gt; | , ,ϑ) = Ф( + ϑ − ) i i i i i i k 1 1<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where i = 1, 0.34,621 households, y i is the SEWB measure for household i in 2011, δx 1 refers to the focal variable -change in share of conspicuous consumption (share of conspicuous consumption 2011share of conspicuous consumtion 2004 ), X i refers to the vector of covariates, ϑ i are independent and identically distributed N(0, σ 2 ϑ ), κ is a set of cutpoints κ 1 , … κ K − 1 , where K is the number of possible outcomes (in this case K = 3 and hence there are only two cutpointsκ 1 and κ 2 ), and Ф(.) is the standard normal cumulative normal distribution function. The response variable y, in this case, may take one of three values <ref type="figure" coords="4,108.85,248.30,36.45,7.17">(1, 2 or 3)</ref>. The model may also be expressed as a latent linear response, where observed ordinal responses y i are generated from latent continuous responses as shown below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,37.77,282.77,250.88,10.76">y x β ε = +ϑ + i i i i *<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where error terms ε i follow a standard normal distribution N(0,1) and are independent of ϑ i . This results in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,37.77,326.47,250.88,36.89">⎧ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ y y κ κ y κ κ y = 1 i f &lt; 2 i f &lt; &lt; 3 i f &lt; i i i i * 1 1 * 2 K−1 *<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 1 -worse, 2 -same and 3better. We conduct the analysis with multiple sets of X i -(1) with just the variable of interest: change in share of conspicuous consumption, (2) with state level changes in: mean income (log) and income inequality (gini coefficient), (3) with household characteristics: location (urban/rural, metro city), social group, number of members in the household, number of years of education (of the most literate member of the household), SEWB in 2004, and (4) with changes in objective indicators of economic wellbeing: monthly income and household assets. The results of the random-effects ordered probit models are presented in <ref type="table" coords="4,86.00,476.83,26.54,7.17" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The four columns present the coefficients and their standard errors (robust standard errors are reported in parentheses). The fourth column corresponds to the results of the full model presented in Eq. (1) with state level controls, household characteristics and indicators of economic status. In all the four models, the coefficient of interest, (coefficient of change in the share of conspicuous consumption) is found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Consistent with our predictions, the sign of the coefficient is positive, indicating that a higher share of conspicuous consumption in 2011 compared to 2004 results in an increase in the probability of the household to report an elevated sense of economic well-being. Together, the effects indicate a significant shift towards a better SEWB (=3) when there is an increase in Δ conspicuous consumption. Further, consistent with earlier findings on Easterlin paradox, we find that changes in state mean income do not have any significant effect on SEWB. However, an increase in income inequality is found to have a negative impact of SEWB, providing support for the argument that relative income levels may play a significant role in explaining SEWB rather than absolute economic growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Bottom of the pyramid</head><p>We categorize the bottom 10 percentile (in terms of household income) within each state as the low-income group or the bottom of the pyramid (BOP). We then conduct a series of analyses to estimate whether the effect of conspicuous consumption on SEWB is different for the BOP households. First, we compare the effect between the bottom 10 percentile (BOP) and the rest of the households (column 1 in <ref type="table" coords="4,306.60,531.08,27.27,7.17" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Second, we compare the effects between the bottom 10 percentile and the penultimate 10 percentile group (the group of households just above the BOP line) in terms of income within each state (reduced sample of 6839 households -column 2 in <ref type="table" coords="4,524.36,562.49,26.81,7.17" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>).

Across the three analyses, the interaction term between low-income group and change in conspicuous consumption is consistently found to be positive and significant (p &lt; 0.05). Evidently, the low-income households are more susceptible to a sense of increased economic well-being when they set aside a higher portion of their expenses for conspicuous goods. This effect is consistent irrespective of the comparison grouprest of the sample, penultimate 10 percentile (in terms of income) or top 10 percentile. We present the predicted probabilities of BOP and top 10 percentile households reporting different levels of SEWB for a 1% change in Δ conspicuous consumption in <ref type="table" coords="4,454.00,708.93,25.40,7.17" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The marginal effects are insignificant for the top 10 percentile income households, indicating that increasing conspicuous consumption did not change the likelihood of reporting better SEWB. However, in the case of BOP, there is a 6.5 percentage point (p &lt; 0.05) decline in reporting 'worse' SEWB(=1), 5.7 percentage point (p &lt; 0.05) decline in reporting 'same' SEWB (= 2), and a 12.2 percentage point (p &lt; 0.05) increase in reporting a 'better' SEWB(=3). Overall, results indicate that BOP households tend to derive a higher sense of economic well-being from consuming conspicuous goods.</p></div>

We use two different empirical approaches -(i) using an ordered probit model in which SEWB in 2011 is modeled as function of change in conspicuous consumption and control variables in 2011 compared to 2004, and (ii) using a random effects panel ordered probit model in which SEWB is modeled as a function of conspicuous consumption and control variables. Further, we also examine whether the effect of conspicuous consumption on SEWB is different for the BOP households. We employed both the empirical approaches and compared the BOP households against (i) rest of the households, (ii) the layer just above the BOP households, and (iii) the high-income households.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Policy implications</head><p>The conclusion that conspicuous consumption has a significant impact on SEWB, beyond objective measures of economic well-being and economic growth, has far reaching policy and marketing implications. Our estimates suggest that the need and gratification from exhibiting status via conspicuous consumption would lead households to increase the share of conspicuous consumption to "feel" better and that this gets more pronounced in poorer households. This does not necessarily represent a pathology among the poor, but a possible response to the institutional and structural elements that provide alternate ways of "feeling better". While an improved sense of economic well-being may be beneficial to the household and the economy as a whole from a policy perspective, an increase in the share of conspicuous consumption indicates substantial diversion of resources from other uses <ref type="bibr" coords="6,325.19,143.47,89.30,7.17" target="#b34">(Jaikumar &amp; Sarin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,418.33,143.47,70.63,7.17" target="#b68">van Kempen, 2004)</ref>, which may have helped improve the economic status in the long term (e.g. education and savings). Further this effect is found to be stronger for low-income households (BOP) indicating that such households are likely to suffer the consequences of lesser savings and weaker endowments in terms of education and assets, which is common across BOP in emerging markets <ref type="bibr" coords="6,338.29,206.23,50.53,7.17" target="#b0">(Alkire, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,392.54,206.23,68.61,7.17" target="#b6">Bloch et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,464.88,206.23,50.36,7.17" target="#b26">Gasper, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,518.96,206.23,38.68,7.17" target="#b61">Sen, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,306.60,216.66,67.91,7.17" target="#b67">van Kempen, 2003)</ref>.

This raises questions about policies like cash transfers that are increasingly finding favor in the development policy discourse. Overall, we argue that the policy goal of the governments in emerging economies should be to provide better returns to education and access to well-performing financial institutions for the BOP. Rather than focusing on an increase in overall state income, focus should be directed at reducing the prevalent income inequality. Together, this would help improve perceptions of economic well-being while keeping conspicuous consumption under check.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Marketing implications</head><p>From a marketing perspective, our results suggest that firms are likely to benefit from marketing their products, even to the members of the lower end of the income distribution, with a conspicuous value, stressing on the social benefits. However, firms should also be socially responsible in the marketing message conveyed to the lower income group. While positioning a product as status rewarding may be beneficial for the firm, but as our results suggest, it results in instilling a false sense of economic well-being in the minds of the BOP consumers. This may result in a vicious circle of the poor remaining poor in the long term and may adversely affect the firms' ability to sell high value products to that segment. Evidently, the conspicuous nature of goods and services may be perceived as both an advantage and threat to the firm's reputation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Theoretical implications</head><p>Our study makes several contributions to the literature on conspicuous consumption and BOP markets. The stream of literature on Easterlin paradox argues that relative income levels may explain the lack of clear relationship between economic growth and perceived wellbeing (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,352.80,697.88,109.94,7.17" target="#b17">Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,468.34,697.88,51.31,7.17" target="#b42">Layard, 2005)</ref>. Another stream argues that consumers are likely to resort to different consumption behaviors to address the issue of relative income levels or income inequalities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,371.34,729.28,85.82,7.17" target="#b34">Jaikumar &amp; Sarin, 2015)</ref>.

Evidently, conspicuous consumption could be viewed as market device that may bring about a meaningful change, in terms of perceived economic wellbeing. While leveraging assets, a form of human agency may help households emerge out of poverty traps <ref type="bibr" coords="7,188.27,174.83,76.93,7.17" target="#b54">(Narayan et al., 2009</ref>), our study identifies another form of human agency that may improve a BOP household's perception, but may not economically help in the long term. Thus, our work may also be relevant to the growing stream of literature on human agency and transformative consumer research <ref type="bibr" coords="7,37.59,227.16,159.24,7.17" target="#b50">(Mick, Pettigrew, Pechmann, &amp; Ozanne, 2012</ref>) that focus on improving well-being of the BOP segment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Limitations and future work</head><p>In concluding, we like to acknowledge a few limitations of our study and suggest avenues for further research. First, we consider higher conspicuous consumption as an indicator of the household's ability and willingness to spend on conspicuous goods to signal higher social status and derive a sense of economic well-being. However each item classified as a conspicuous good may have a range within which the consumption motivation would be to signal social status. Due to the limitations of the secondary data, we do not segregate the expenses under each item. However, we do conduct a robustness study using just one itemjewelry and ornaments, considered highly conspicuous across its entire range (based on the argument that there is no minimum threshold for its consumption to be conspicuous). Second, while we address household specific effects on SEWB and conspicuous consumption using a panel model, we do not explicitly identify an extraneous factor to address any potential endogeneity issues. As a result we cannot rule out the presence of other time variant factors that are correlated to both changes in SEWB and share of conspicuous consumption. Further research can focus on identifying potential instruments that may be related to conspicuous consumption and eliminate reverse causal effects (SEWB affecting conspicuous consumption). Finally, our hypothesis on the BOP households rests on the assumption that poor are market-savvy and their capabilities allow them to indulge in conspicuous consumptions to experience a better sense of SEWB. However, prolonged material deprivation in the BOP may lead to 'transcendent fatalism', where the poor accept poverty as preordained by fate and lower their aspiration to cope with the situation <ref type="bibr" coords="7,438.69,268.99,61.29,7.17" target="#b33">(Hundeide, 1999)</ref>. This psychological barrier to happiness may thus adversely affect both conspicuous consumption and SEWB. Further research may probe the drivers of SEWB in households that have been under prolonged material deprivation and have low aspirations in terms of social status.</p><p>Appendix A Appendix A.

a Gini index is computed using income data from households in 2004 and 2011. To get 

a clear picture of the income inequality prevalent in the state, households with negative 
or zero incomes are converted to 0.1 to ensure that they are included in the inequality 
calculations. 
b This binary variable indicates whether the household is located in one of the six 

metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore). 
c Number of years of education of the most literate member of the household -ranges 

from 1 year (1st standard) to 15 years (Graduate and above). 
d Household assets refers to sum of 30 dichotomous items measuring household 

possessions and housing quality.
