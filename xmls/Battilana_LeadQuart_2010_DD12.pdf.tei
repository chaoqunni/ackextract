<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t</head><p>This paper bridges the leadership and organizational change literatures by exploring the relationship between managers' leadership competencies (namely, their effectiveness at person-oriented and task-oriented behaviors) and the likelihood that they will emphasize the different activities involved in planned organizational change implementation (namely, communicating the need for change, mobilizing others to support the change, and evaluating the change implementation). We examine this relationship using data from 89 clinical managers at the United Kingdom National Health Service who implemented change projects between 2003 and 2004. Our results lend overall support to the proposed theory. This finding suggests that treating planned organizational change as a generic phenomenon might mask important idiosyncrasies associated both with the different activities involved in the change implementation process and with the unique functions that leadership competencies might play in the execution of these activities.</p></div>

In this model, task-oriented skills are those related to organizational structure, design, and control, and to establishing routines to attain organizational goals and objectives <ref type="bibr" coords="2,76.65,431.47,44.08,7.54" target="#b6">(Bass, 1990)</ref>.

Person-oriented skills include behaviors that promote collaborative interaction among organization members, establish a supportive social climate, and promote management practices that ensure equitable treatment of organization members <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.05,462.87,42.62,7.54" target="#b6">(Bass, 1990)</ref>. These interpersonal skills are critical to planned organizational change implementation because they enable leaders to motivate and direct followers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,36.85,483.79,60.54,7.54" target="#b18">(Chemers, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,99.72,483.79,116.83,7.54" target="#b104">van Knippenberg &amp; Hogg, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,218.88,483.79,40.12,7.54" target="#b112">Yukl, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The task-/person-oriented behaviors model is particularly relevant and suitable for this study, for three main reasons. First and foremost, this model is particularly well suited to the study of leadership in the context of organizational change. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.90,504.71,73.18,7.54;2,36.85,515.20,24.88,7.54" target="#b81">Nadler and Tushman (1999)</ref> highlighted that task-oriented behaviors and person-oriented behaviors are key to influence organizational change. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,36.85,525.63,83.36,7.54">Beer and Nohria (2000)</ref> made a distinction between "Theory E" leaders, who are more task-oriented and "Theory O" leaders, who are more person-oriented. They proposed that these different categories of leaders adopt different approaches to change implementation. Second, task-oriented and person-oriented leadership behaviors have been shown to cover a vast majority of the day-to-day leadership activities in which leaders engage at the supervisory level <ref type="bibr" coords="2,282.16,557.05,53.33,7.54" target="#b17">(Casimir, 2001)</ref>. The task-/person-oriented behaviors model is thus particularly appropriate as we focus, in the context of this study, on change behaviors carried out by managers who were all in a supervisory role. Finally, although the introduction of this model goes back to the 1950s, recent empirical research shows that the task-/person-oriented behaviors model remains a powerful model to analyze leadership effectiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="2,408.35,588.40,69.30,7.54" target="#b56">(Judge et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,480.53,588.40,22.57,7.54;2,36.85,598.88,19.31,7.54" target="#b62">Keller, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Effectiveness at task-oriented and person-oriented behaviors requires different but related sets of competencies. Effectiveness at task-oriented behaviors hinges on the ability to clarify task requirements and structure tasks around an organization's mission and objectives <ref type="bibr" coords="2,95.13,630.24,44.87,7.54" target="#b6">(Bass, 1990)</ref>. Effectiveness at person-oriented behaviors, on the other hand, relies on the ability to show consideration for others as well as to take into account one's own and others' emotions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.84,640.72,83.28,7.54" target="#b34">(Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.12,640.72,65.02,7.54;2,36.85,651.16,20.97,7.54" target="#b37">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,59.81,651.16,73.28,7.54" target="#b93">Seltzer &amp; Bass, 1990)</ref>. Managers might be effective at both task-oriented and person-oriented leadership behaviors, or they might be effective at only one or the other, or perhaps at neither. Such variation in leadership behaviors, we argue, has implications for planned organizational change implementation. More specifically, we argue that, depending on their mix of leadership competencies, leaders might differentially emphasize the activities involved in planned organizational change implementation.</p><p>To implement planned organizational change projects, leaders undertake specific activities <ref type="bibr" coords="3,378.99,54.92,51.70,7.54" target="#b33">(Galpin, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,432.28,54.92,49.03,7.54" target="#b57">Judson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,482.91,54.92,24.63,7.54;3,41.22,65.35,20.97,7.54" target="#b67">Kotter, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,64.57,65.35,47.16,7.54">Lewin, 1947;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,114.12,65.35,50.48,7.54">Rogers, 1962)</ref> and mistakes in the execution of any of these activities or efforts to bypass some of them are detrimental to the progress of change <ref type="bibr" coords="3,178.75,75.84,104.11,7.54" target="#b1">(Armenakis &amp; Bedeian, 1999)</ref>. In this paper, based on a detailed review of the literature, we adopt a model that emphasizes three key activities involved in planned organizational change implementation: communicating, mobilizing, and evaluating. Communicating refers to activities leaders undertake to make the case for change, to share their vision of the need for change with followers. Mobilizing refers to actions leaders undertake to gain co-workers' support for and acceptance of the enactment of new work routines. Evaluating refers to measures leaders employ to monitor and assess the impact of implementation efforts and institutionalize changes.</p><p>Although these three sets of activities do not do complete justice to the complexity of the change implementation process, they have been identified in the literature on organizational change as key categories, which are conceptually distinct from each other and which cover most of the activities involved in change implementation. Prior conceptual and empirical works (despite differences among them) recurrently emphasize these three sets of activities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,345.03,170.00,91.66,7.54" target="#b7">Beckhard &amp; Harris, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,439.14,170.00,41.55,7.54" target="#b8">Beer, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,483.13,170.00,24.35,7.54;3,41.21,180.43,45.46,7.54" target="#b32">Ford &amp; Greer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.00,180.43,49.37,7.54" target="#b58">Kanter, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.71,180.43,93.14,7.54" target="#b79">Nadler &amp; Tushman, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,236.17,180.43,85.30,7.54" target="#b100">Tichy &amp; Devanna, 1986)</ref>. Building on <ref type="bibr" coords="3,371.96,180.43,54.87,7.54">Lewin's (1947)</ref> three-phase model of change, these studies distinguish between these three types of change implementation activities, highlighting that understanding how change unfolds requires understanding what induces a leader to emphasize these activities (for reviews see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,460.46,201.35,47.03,7.54" target="#b1">Armenakis &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,41.21,211.84,69.11,7.54" target="#b1">Bedeian, 1999, and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,112.70,211.84,68.11,7.54" target="#b60">Kanter et al., 1992)</ref>.</p><p>In the remainder of the paper, we examine the relationship between managers' leadership competencies and their likelihood to put emphasis on each of the three change implementation activities. More specifically, we propose that leaders who are more effective in person-oriented behaviors are more likely to focus on the communicating and on the mobilizing activities than other leaders, and less likely to focus on the evaluating activities than other leaders; and that leaders who are more effective in taskoriented behaviors are more likely to focus on the mobilizing and the evaluating activities than other leaders, and less likely to focus on the communicating activities than other leaders.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Setting: The United Kingdom National Health Service</head><p>Our field of study was the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS). The NHS is a public, state-funded health system with one million employees and a budget of more than £60 billion that offers a wide range of preventive, primary, and acute health care services. The government is responsible for financing and guaranteeing universal healthcare that is free at the point of service.</p><p>In 1997, under the leadership of the Labour Government, the NHS embarked on a ten-year modernization effort aimed at improving the quality, reliability, effectiveness, and value of the healthcare services delivered to society <ref type="bibr" coords="4,417.99,651.15,85.16,7.54;4,36.85,661.64,19.59,7.54">(Department of Health, 1999)</ref>. The goal set by the government was to "design a service centered on patients which puts them first; [the service] will be faster, more convenient and offer [patients] more choice" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,249.57,672.07,107.29,7.54">(Department of Health, 2006)</ref>. At the organizational level, the goal of creating a patient and service oriented NHS entailed reducing waiting times for emergency and hospital services, improving the quality of services for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, developing the range and complexity of primary care services, and using the work force in a more effective manner.</p><p>The NHS is a particularly appropriate setting for testing our hypotheses because of its reliance on local leaders to implement national policy (Department of Health, 1997). NHS managers play a key role in the implementation of changes because NHS policies provide, rather than a narrowly defined blueprint, a broad outline that accommodates local innovation <ref type="bibr" coords="5,439.70,96.76,67.81,7.54;5,41.21,107.24,20.97,7.54" target="#b43">(Harrison &amp; Wood, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,64.06,107.24,100.72,7.54" target="#b86">Peckham &amp; Exworthy, 2003)</ref>. Thus, although the government mandates initiatives for change, managers at the regional and organizational levels are responsible for implementing changes appropriate to local needs and circumstances. In this type of setting, local leaders' strategies for managing the change process are less likely to be constrained by actors outside the local context. These conditions make it possible to analyze the impact of leadership competencies on the way managers lead the implementation of organizational change projects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data collection and sample</head><p>We test our hypotheses with data from change projects conducted by middle or top managers from the NHS between January 2003 and December 2004. Our data were gathered from 95 managers working in 81 different organizations within the NHS who attended a two-week strategic leadership executive education program in 2003. Each program participant was required to design and implement a change project in his/her organization. Participants were self-selected into the program and free to choose the change project they implemented. Before attending the program, participants were required to write a comprehensive description of the change project they intended to initiate. They started implementing their change project right after the program and were asked to refine their change project description after three months of implementation to reflect any modification of their change project. Participants were also asked to participate in a 360-degree leadership survey that was filled out three months before they attended the executive education program. Leadership data were thus collected three months before they attended the program and three months and a half before their started implementing their change project.</p><p>After twelve months of project implementation, we administered a telephone survey to collect information about how program participants had implemented their change projects. The participants also granted us access to their resumes. Although participation was voluntary, all program participants agreed to participate in the study. Data for six participants were incomplete, leaving a final sample of 89 change projects implemented by 89 managers in 77 different organizations.</p><p>The 89 managers, 67 women and 22 men, ranged in age from 34 to 56 years (average age 43); 21 were physicians, 41 were nurses, and the remaining 27 were allied health professionals (e.g., physiotherapists, podiatrists, dieticians, and occupational therapists). All study participants had managerial responsibilities, ranging from service line manager within a single hospital to regional quality improvement managers, and came from a variety of NHS organizations. Forty-four percent worked in outpatient clinics, 45% in hospitals or other secondary care organizations, and the remaining 11% in NHS administrative bodies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Dependent variables: Emphasis on change implementation activities</head><p>To collect information about how managers implemented their change projects, we developed and pilot tested a telephone survey. This survey was designed to collect data about the three sets of activities involved in change implementation that we identified through our literature review (i.e., communicating, mobilizing and evaluating). The survey was administered to the managers after twelve months of project implementation. Survey items were uniformly structured on a 5-point Likert scale (from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree). We constructed our three dependent variables of interest (communicating activities, mobilizing activities, and evaluating activities) as the unweighted average of items that corresponded to each of the three dimensions of the change implementation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Communicating</head><p>To measure the degree of emphasis that leaders put on the communicating activities, we used a scale comprising four items: (1) communicating the vision for change was a critical aspect of the change process; (2) relative to other aspects of the change process, the focal manager devoted significant time to communicating the need for change among other organizational members;</p><p>(3) to the focal manager, effectively communicating the ideas behind the change was much more important than other aspects of the change process; and (4) the focal manager devoted a significant amount of time and energy to developing the vision for the outcomes of the organizational change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Mobilizing</head><p>To measure the degree of emphasis that leaders put on the mobilizing activities, we used a scale comprising four items: (1) the focal manager specifically sought out others in his/her organization to help shape the vision of the organization following the change; (2) the focal manager worked on this change project with considerable help and input from others in the organization;</p><p>(3) to the focal manager, seeking input from a wide variety of stakeholder groups in the organization was a key factor in smoothing the way for the introduction of the change; and (4) the focal manager spent a significant amount of time in redesigning organizational processes and systems to prepare his/her organization for the change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Evaluating</head><p>Finally, to measure the degree of emphasis that leaders put on the evaluating activities, we used a scale comprising two items: (1) the focal manager utilized a formal system of measurement to evaluate the impact of the change; and (2) the focal manager used a formal system of measurement to evaluate the need for possible refinements to the way the change was implemented in the organization.</p><p>We measured the reliability of these items using Cronbach's alpha to assess the adequacy of the scales. Scale reliability coefficients for each of the three scales were, respectively, 0.62 for communicating, 0.64 for mobilizing, and 0.86 for evaluating. Note that all three scale reliability coefficients were greater than 0.60, which is the acceptable threshold value for exploratory studies like ours <ref type="bibr" coords="6,98.25,138.59,60.29,7.54" target="#b82">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. We also ran confirmatory factor analysis to further establish the validity and reliability of our dependent variables. The result of this exercise improved our confidence in the measurement of our dependent variables. All test statistics were significant and models fit were very high, supporting our claim that change activities are modeled correctly (i.e., items are correctly stratified into each category). 5</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Independent variables: Leadership effectiveness</head><p>Data about participants' leadership competencies were collected using the Global Leadership Life Inventory (GLLI) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,472.35,211.84,30.77,7.54;6,36.85,222.27,42.10,7.54" target="#b64">(Kets de Vries, 2002)</ref>.

For each manager, we obtained between four and twelve evaluations (average, 7.9). Scale reliability coefficients (i.e. standardized Cronbach's alpha values) for each of the two effectiveness measures were 0.60 and 0.74, respectively, across category (superordinates, subordinates, and peers) averages. 6 Both leadership effectiveness variables were mean-centered in all regression analyses. Because the leadership survey was administered three months before the change projects were implemented, the risk of reverse causality was minimized. Furthermore, the potential common method variance bias does not materialize in this study as we gathered data for the independent variables (leadership effectiveness) and dependent variables (emphasis on planned change implementation activities) from different sources at different points in time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Control variables</head><p>Because managers might put varying degrees of emphasis on the different activities associated with the implementation of planned organizational change for reasons other than their leadership competencies, we controlled for a number of project-specific, organization-specific, and career-specific characteristics identified in prior work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">Project type</head><p>The type of change project might affect the degree of emphasis managers place on particular implementation tasks. Creating a new service, for example, usually requires more energy and effort than redesigning an existing service (Van de Ven, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,454.45,358.28,53.08,7.54;7,41.21,368.77,19.59,7.54" target="#b103">Angle, &amp; Poole, 1989)</ref>. Hence, managers who implement change projects that create a new service might put more emphasis on each of the three planned organizational change implementation activities. Accordingly, if we do not control for what type of project is implemented, we risk incorrectly attributing the associated variation on the dependent variables (i.e., emphasis on different activities involved in the change implementation) to leadership qualities. We thus included in our regression models a dummy for creation of a new service.</p><p>To create this variable, we coded each project into different project type categories using the change project descriptions prepared by the participants after three months of project implementation. We distinguished between projects aimed at creating new administrative or patient care services and projects aimed at redesigning existing administrative or patient care services.

As a result, they may put more emphasis on the three sets of activities involved in planned organizational change implementation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Robustness checks and supplementary analyses</head><p>A related question is whether leadership competencies have independent effects on change implementation or they act as complements/substitutes. To address this inquiry, we ran supplementary analyses, including interaction terms between the two leadership competencies for each phase. Below, we report the results of these supplementary regressions <ref type="table" coords="10,424.39,410.60,31.98,7.54" target="#tab_4">(Table 5)</ref>.</p><p>The results first show that the interaction term is insignificant on communicating. Hence, it appears that effectiveness in taskand person-oriented behaviors has independent effects on the emphasis put on the communicating activities. Second, the interaction terms are significant on both mobilizing and evaluating, indicating that the competency in one dimension has an influence on how the other dimension is associated with the degree of emphasis put on each of these two sets of activities. Third, both of these interaction terms (that is, on mobilizing and evaluating) are significant and positive. This is convergent with the finding of a number of studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="11,172.29,337.36,41.41,7.54" target="#b6">Bass, 1990)</ref> suggesting that leaders who are highly skilled in both person-oriented and taskoriented behaviors are likely to be more effective than other leaders. A potential concern regarding the robustness of the reported results is related to the observed moderately high correlation among our independent variables (i.e. leadership competencies) and its potential influence on model testing. Yet, some positive correlation among dimensions of leadership is not an artifact of our data and should in fact be expected. As highlighted in a number of studies, shared organizational, historical, and dispositional factors might affect the level and evolution of a wide range of leadership competencies at the same time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="11,168.55,400.12,115.74,7.54" target="#b5">Bartone, Snook, &amp; Tremble, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,285.50,400.12,39.13,7.54" target="#b6">Bass, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,325.92,400.12,54.06,7.54" target="#b36">Goleman 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,381.20,400.12,101.97,7.54" target="#b55">Judge, Heller, &amp; Mount, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,484.37,400.12,23.08,7.54;11,41.21,410.55,54.01,7.54" target="#b85">Parker &amp; Ogilvie, 1996)</ref>. Judge and his colleagues' (2004) meta-analysis of the showing consideration-initiating structure model is in line with these studies and our data. They report that the correlation between the two leadership dimensions is close to 0.50 in two of the most widely used questionnaires (LBDQ and LBDQ-XII) in a combined sample of over 5000 observations. By means of comparison, note that the correlation coefficient we report is 0.56 (in a sample of 89 observations). Also note that potential multi-collinearity is not a serious concern in our empirical examination, because (1) the correlation is sizable, but not critically high (i.e., over 0.8 in absolute value; <ref type="bibr" coords="11,41.21,462.88,54.87,7.54" target="#b63">Kennedy, 2003)</ref>; (2) calculated variance inflation factors (VIFs) is less than two for all regression models, much lower than the critical value of ten, indicating no serious multi-collinearity; and (3) hierarchically nested regressions are reported for all dependent variables, leaving all effects visible and open to interpretation by the reader.</p><p>To further amplify our confidence in the results, we reran our regressions using 'orthogonal' measures of leadership competencies. More concretely, we ran principal-component factors analysis on leadership competencies and applied orthogonal varimax rotation on the resulting factors. Then, based on varimax rotated factors, we calculated scoring coefficients (assuming regression scoring). We thus forced our measures to be as distinct from each other as possible within the confines of our data. In this empirical exercise, our aim was to see whether the results were robust to this treatment. The result of this analysis shows that 'orthogonal' measures slightly increase model fit, but overall do not affect sign and significance of control variables. The results on the independent variables remain unchanged (with the exception of model 4 on communicating-wherein task-oriented competencies keeps its signs and now remains significant even when entered with person-oriented competencies).</p><p>A separate concern with our empirical analysis is related to the fact that we use managers' declarations to measure the emphasis they put on the different change implementation activities. Hence, potential self-report bias (i.e., tendency of respondents to respond in socially desirable ways) is a legitimate concern. Earlier work highlights that an individual's likelihood to give a biased answer can be identified as a function of (i) the sensitivity of construct of interest (e.g. drug-use vs. coffee-consumption at work), (ii) situational pressures to give socially desirable answers (e.g., risk of getting fired and social isolation), and (iii) individuals' disposition to give answers in any particular direction <ref type="bibr" coords="11,168.20,630.23,125.99,7.54" target="#b24">(Donaldson &amp; Grant-Vallone, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,296.44,630.23,104.75,7.54" target="#b46">Himmelfarb &amp; Lickteig, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,403.36,630.23,104.10,7.54" target="#b77">Moorman &amp; Podsakoff, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,41.21,640.72,89.87,7.54" target="#b89">Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,133.11,640.72,57.16,7.54" target="#b92">Schwartz, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,192.29,640.72,51.09,7.54" target="#b96">Spector, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,245.36,640.72,80.65,7.54" target="#b114">Zerbe &amp; Paulhus, 1987)</ref>. The first two concerns (sensitivity and situational factors) are not a problem in our study, by its very design. How much emphasis put on a given issue is hardly 'sensitive' and it is not clear what the 'socially desirable' level is. Further mitigating these concerns is the way we administrated the phone survey: direct, oneto-one phone interview with the manager, under strict confidentiality (which guarantees non-release of individual data to third parties, including the members of the focal managers' organization). For independent variables, statistical significance is based on one-tailed tests. † p b 0.10; * p b 0.05; ** p b 0.01.</p><p>But, still, we cannot rule out individual's disposition to give biased answers. While we do not have any solid priors to expect a bias, we conducted further examination. In an attempt to sort out this issue within the confines of our data, we checked for the possible influence of managers' over-confidence. Over-confident managers are likely to experience a self enhancement bias <ref type="bibr" coords="12,36.85,86.27,182.25,7.54" target="#b2">(Atwater, Ostroff, Yammarino, &amp; Fleenor, 1998)</ref>. As a result, they are more likely to develop a falsely positive sense of accomplishment and thereby to give biased answers. Hence, self-report bias (if there is any) must be, at least partially, captured by the inclusion of this variable in the regressions. To create a measure of over-confidence, we took advantage of the 360°l eadership data. We first calculated leadership scores (as unweighted averages of task-and person-oriented skills), based on both the managers' and others' evaluations, and then took the difference between these two scores (i.e., self minus others' evaluation). 9 When included, this variable (over-confidence) invariably took a positive sign (indicating that over-confident managers are potentially more likely to report more emphasis on each dimension), but its inclusion did not affect the sign and significance of our independent variables in any model.</p><p>Finally, in supplemental regression models (not reported here) we included gender, professional background (i.e., physicians, nurses or allied health professionals) and hierarchical position in the organization as additional control variables. These variables (both when added separately and together) were not significant in any model, nor did they affect the sign or significance of any variables of interest. Further, we checked for alternative measures of organization size (large vs. small organization dummy), tenure (tenure in management position and tenure in the organization), and educational background (highest management degree achieved). It thus appears that our results are not an artifact of the way we measured the variables in our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we examined the relationship between two managers' leadership competencies and the likelihood that they would focus on three main activities associated with implementing planned organizational change. Supporting our expectations, the results suggest significant, yet different, relationships between effectiveness at task-oriented and person-oriented leadership behaviors and the three change implementation activities of communicating, mobilizing, and evaluating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Relationship between leadership competencies and change implementation activities</head><p>This study yields two important findings of note, (1) leaders who are more effective at task-oriented behaviors are more likely to focus on both the mobilizing and evaluating activities associated with planned organizational change implementation (than other leaders), and (2) leaders who are more effective at person-oriented behaviors are more likely to focus on the communicating activities of planned organizational change implementation (than other leaders).</p><p>Regarding the communicating activities of planned organizational change implementation, our theory posited that managers whose leadership strengths emphasize person-oriented behaviors would place more emphasis on communicating the need for organizational change, whereas leaders whose strengths lay in task-oriented behaviors would place less emphasis on this implementation activity than other leaders. Although our analyses provided empirical support for our hypothesis regarding personoriented leadership, we found no support for our hypothesis regarding task-oriented leadership. The results even offered partial support for the opposite prediction according to which task-oriented leaders would emphasize communicating activities. One explanation for this finding might relate to the notion that leaders who are effective at task-oriented behaviors are aware that they need to share their visions with others, keep members' attention on goals, and guide them through the implementation of new organizational designs <ref type="bibr" coords="12,119.34,473.36,115.74,7.54" target="#b47">(Hogan, Curphy, &amp; Hogan, 1994)</ref>. Thus, leaders who are effective at task-oriented behaviors might need to interact with peers and followers to initiate an intended new structure. Furthermore, we found that managers implementing projects in large organizations were more likely to emphasize the communicating activities associated with planned organizational change projects. This supported our expectation that larger organizations might both have more standard operating procedures and resources devoted to change programs <ref type="bibr" coords="12,138.78,515.20,68.40,7.54" target="#b52">(Huber et al., 1993)</ref> and be more resistant to change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="12,340.90,515.20,88.68,7.54">Blau &amp; Schoenherr, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,431.15,515.20,42.42,7.54" target="#b19">Child, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,475.14,515.20,27.94,7.54;12,36.85,525.63,63.00,7.54" target="#b42">Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,101.88,525.63,55.76,7.54" target="#b66">Kimberly, 1976)</ref>.</p><p>As expected, task-oriented leaders were found to emphasize the mobilizing activities that are associated with the implementation process for planned organizational change.

Such a coalition must include the different groups of organizational stakeholders, who are involved in and/or affected by the change project, not only the ones who belong to the change agent's team. Although person-oriented leaders are good at inspiring and mobilizing the members of their own teams, task-oriented leaders are able to mobilize both their team members and other stakeholders by redesigning organizational processes and systems according to the change. Furthermore, the finding that leaders in our sample with advanced management education unexpectedly placed less emphasis on the mobilizing tasks of change implementation provides some support for growing concern over the limitations of advanced management education and its impact on managers' effectiveness in organizational settings <ref type="bibr" coords="12,227.16,630.23,119.49,7.54" target="#b15">(Boyatzis, Stubbs, &amp; Taylor, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,348.83,630.23,61.43,7.54" target="#b75">Mintzberg, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,412.44,630.23,90.74,7.54">Porter &amp; McKibbin, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,36.85,640.72,50.60,7.54" target="#b94">Shipper, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,42.07,673.90,2.74,4.02">9</ref> Based on this measure, we also created a dummy variable which is equal to one if the difference is more than one standard deviation, and zero otherwise.

By showing different activities to have different correlates in terms of leadership competencies, our results support the notion of organizational change as a complex, dynamic process <ref type="bibr" coords="13,457.28,264.11,50.22,7.54;13,41.22,274.60,52.82,7.54" target="#b1">(Armenakis &amp; Bedeian, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,96.04,274.60,92.84,7.54" target="#b103">Van de Ven &amp; Poole, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Second, this study contributes to the stream of research about organizational change by linking the work of organizational theorists and more practice-oriented scholars. The field of research about change has been hampered by the schism between theory and practice <ref type="bibr" coords="13,115.76,305.95,84.30,7.54" target="#b16">(Burke &amp; Litwin, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,202.84,305.95,52.72,7.54" target="#b25">Durand, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,258.29,305.95,62.27,7.54" target="#b109">Woodman, 1989)</ref>, and although many (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,422.19,305.95,85.31,7.54" target="#b9">Beer &amp; Eisenstat, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,41.22,316.44,78.57,7.54" target="#b88">Pettigrew et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,121.55,316.44,57.77,7.54" target="#b109">Woodman, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,185.10,316.44,17.35,7.54" target="#b110">Woodman, , 1993</ref> have called for studies to try to resolve this dichotomy, organizational theorists and practice-oriented scholars have continued to work in rather isolated worlds, examining different aspects of organizational change. Organizational theorists have shown that achieving organization-level change cannot be reduced to a linear process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,487.33,337.36,20.16,7.54;13,41.22,347.79,82.71,7.54" target="#b0">Amis, Slack, &amp; Hinings, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,125.91,347.79,153.46,7.54" target="#b29">Ferlie, Fitzgerald, Wood, &amp; Hawkins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,281.36,347.79,104.53,7.54">Hinings &amp; Greenwood, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,387.94,347.79,49.03,7.54" target="#b59">Kanter, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,439.02,347.79,68.46,7.54;13,41.22,358.28,47.64,7.54" target="#b87">Pettigrew, Ferlie, &amp; McKee, 1992)</ref>. It is rather a complex and, at times, chaotic process of delays and oscillations that often yields unintended outcomes <ref type="bibr" coords="13,41.22,368.71,105.04,7.54" target="#b1">(Armenakis &amp; Bedeian, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,148.02,368.71,92.84,7.54" target="#b103">Van de Ven &amp; Poole, 1995)</ref>. On the other hand, practice-oriented scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,430.92,368.71,48.35,7.54" target="#b33">Galpin, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,481.04,368.71,26.46,7.54;13,41.22,379.20,20.97,7.54" target="#b57">Judson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,64.69,379.20,48.07,7.54" target="#b67">Kotter, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,115.25,379.20,47.22,7.54">Lewin, 1947;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,164.97,379.20,50.55,7.54">Rogers, 1962)</ref> have developed normative process models to guide managers' implementation efforts and reduce the uncertainty of the change process.</p><p>In this study, although we used normative process models of change as a foundation for our empirical work, we relied on the work of organizational theorists to challenge two of the fundamental assumptions of those models, namely, the linearity of the process of change, and managers' ability to engage in the different activities involved in the implementation of change. Instead of assuming a linear process and focusing on phases of planned organizational change implementation, we focused on different activities associated with the process of planned organizational change implementation. We then examined whether managers' leadership competencies influenced the likelihood that they would emphasize each of these activities. Some practice-oriented scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,92.47,462.87,84.10,7.54" target="#b9">Beer &amp; Eisenstat, 1996)</ref> have acknowledged that one limitation of normative process models of change is that they do not consider whether managers possess the skills needed to engage in the activities involved in planned organizational change implementation. Our study addresses this limitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Limitations and future research</head><p>Several limitations of this study deserve elaboration and point to future research directions. First and foremost, our analysis must be considered exploratory given the small, non-random sample of managers in the NHS. This poses challenges to the generalizability of our results. Our setting, the NHS, is a large, public sector organization that was undergoing massive changes during our study period. Although this makes the NHS an ideal setting for our study, it also raises question about the generalizability of our results to other contexts (e.g., the private sector or more stable industries).</p><p>Nor can we fully discount the possibility of sampling bias, since our study group consisted of self-selected individuals who applied, and were then selected for, advanced leadership executive training. One might also ask whether the findings obtained for mostly middle managers in our study would be equally likely for managers at other levels of organizations. To address these concerns will require comparisons across contexts and probabilistic samples that will enable researchers to better account for the potential interactive effects of leadership skills and contextual factors on the way leaders manage the key activities associated with planned organizational change implementation.</p><p>Another limitation is that we treat managers' leadership behaviors as fixed during our study. Although our analysis treated leadership behavior as the major independent variable, it must be acknowledged that leaders themselves (especially effective ones) adapt and change in response to the requirements of a given implementation activity. Leaders might have unobserved attributes that predispose them to exhibit particular leadership characteristics, and influence which of the activities of planned organizational change implementation they choose to emphasize. To the extent that this occurs, our results would not reflect the true causal effect of leadership characteristics on attention to specific activities. Dealing with such endogeneity issues in crosssectional studies is always challenging. These concerns are mitigated in this study by the fact that our leadership data were collected prior to the change projects and using a different instrument. The fact that leadership data were collected prior to the executive education program does not, however, enable us to control for the possible influence of this experience on participants' leadership competencies. Further work, either with instrumental variables or with alternative study designs that approach endogeneity in other ways (e.g., analysis of changes over time), could help clarify these issues.</p><p>While the choice of both the leadership and change models used in this study was justified by theoretical considerations that we detailed early on in the paper, it might be interesting to replicate this study using different leadership and/or change models. On leadership competencies, it would also be interesting to examine the relationship between other leadership competencies and change agents' likelihood to emphasize different activities involved in the planned organizational change implementation process. In particular, it would be interesting to explore the influence of transformational leadership-including individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation, idealized influence and inspirational motivation <ref type="bibr" coords="14,291.74,170.00,70.57,7.54">(Bass &amp; Avolio, 1990</ref>)-and/or charismatic leadership, which have already been shown to influence change initiatives in general and the communicating activities involved in the change process in particular <ref type="bibr" coords="14,73.13,190.92,82.12,7.54" target="#b61">(Kark &amp; Van Dijk, 2007)</ref>. A number of measurement instruments, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) <ref type="bibr" coords="14,36.85,201.35,78.76,7.54">(Bass &amp; Avolio, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,118.77,201.35,83.93,7.54" target="#b50">Howell &amp; Avolio, 1993)</ref>, could be used to do so. 10 Similarly, although the choice of the communicatingmobilizing-evaluating model was based on a careful literature review, we recognize that it does not do complete justice to the complexity of the change process that involves a multitude of activities. In future research, it might be interesting to use change models comprising more than three sets of activities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,221.05,232.76,116.34,7.54" target="#b9">Beer, Eisenstat, &amp; Spector, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,339.98,232.76,48.05,7.54" target="#b67">Kotter, 1995)</ref> and to analyze the relationship between leadership competencies and these different sets of activities.</p><p>Separately, it would be interesting to know more about the strategies leaders with different leadership competencies use to execute each of the key implementation activities. Now that we know more about the relationship between individuals' leadership competencies and the likelihood that they will emphasize particular activities associated with planned organizational change implementation, we might inquire into the relationship between the degree of emphasis change agents accord the different change implementation activities and the outcome of the change process. The normative process models of change <ref type="bibr" coords="14,451.15,295.52,52.00,7.54" target="#b33">(Galpin, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,36.85,305.95,50.17,7.54" target="#b57">Judson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,89.74,305.95,48.35,7.54" target="#b67">Kotter, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,140.82,305.95,47.50,7.54">Lewin, 1947;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,191.05,305.95,50.83,7.54">Rogers, 1962)</ref> are based on the assumption that leaders must get involved in all the change implementation activities to successfully implement change, and that efforts to bypass some of them are detrimental to the progress of change <ref type="bibr" coords="14,109.87,326.87,107.35,7.54" target="#b1">(Armenakis &amp; Bedeian, 1999)</ref>. This assumption needs to be questioned. Do leaders need to emphasize all change implementation activities to successfully implement change? Are the leaders who do so the most successful? Answers to these questions are likely to vary depending on the type of change being considered and the type of organization in which change is implemented. There is thus a need for studies examining the influence of emphasis on change activities on project implementation success and the extent to which such emphasis mediates the link between leadership competencies and the project implementation success.</p><p>We would like to also note that our definition ("measures leaders employ to monitor and assess the impact of implementation effort and institutionalize change") and operationalization of evaluating focused on formal systems of measurement. While most studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,36.85,410.55,75.49,7.54" target="#b16">Burke &amp; Litwin, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,113.92,410.55,68.17,7.54" target="#b32">Ford &amp; Greer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,183.66,410.55,46.88,7.54" target="#b33">Galpin, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,232.12,410.55,45.97,7.54" target="#b67">Kotter, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,279.58,410.55,50.45,7.54" target="#b95">Simons, 1995)</ref> that examine the evaluating activities involved in change implementation emphasize formal feedback systems (corresponding to formal systems of measurement), evaluating might also involve less formal forms of evaluation-such as one-on-one discussions with employees <ref type="bibr" coords="14,367.97,431.47,46.74,7.54" target="#b99">(Tichy, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,416.80,431.47,82.49,7.54" target="#b113">Zand &amp; Sorensen, 1975)</ref>. Future research should explore the influence that different leadership competencies have on both types of evaluating activities (formal as well as more informal ones).</p><p>Finally, our finding that their mix of leadership competencies might influence the amount of emphasis leaders put on each of the three key activities associated with the implementation of planned organizational change might have important managerial implications, which require further investigation. First, one can speculate that, in certain situations, using a team-based approach that takes account of managers' competencies related to leading change efforts might be a good strategy. In particular, in the absence of leaders who are effective at both task-oriented and person-oriented behaviors, employing multiple change leaders with complementary competencies might be an effective way to ensure that all aspects of the implementation process are addressed. Managers might be chosen, for example, based on the appropriateness of their competencies to the particular activities of the planned change implementation in which the organization is involved or that require the most attention. Different types of change projects or different change environments might require that one activity be emphasized over another. Using a team-based approach to bring complementary competencies to bear on leading change efforts might inform discussion about how leaders can divide tasks and share roles in leading change in organizations more generally <ref type="bibr" coords="14,317.87,567.47,92.37,7.54" target="#b21">(Day, Gronn, &amp; Salas, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,438.63,567.47,64.49,7.54;14,36.85,577.96,52.60,7.54" target="#b23">Denis, Lamothe, &amp; Langley, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,91.38,577.96,42.69,7.54" target="#b39">Gronn, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,140.03,577.96,16.78,7.54" target="#b40">Gronn, , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,162.93,577.96,80.33,7.54" target="#b47">House &amp; Aditya, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,245.24,577.96,82.58,7.54" target="#b74">Miles &amp; Watkins, 2007)</ref>. Such team-based approach might, however, be complicated to implement not only because of the challenges associated with team leadership <ref type="bibr" coords="14,388.62,588.39,51.99,7.54" target="#b40">(Gronn, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,443.34,588.39,59.80,7.54;14,36.85,598.88,21.68,7.54" target="#b90">Roberts &amp; Stiles, 1999)</ref> but also because of the non-linear nature of the change process. Alternatively, organizations might anticipate and adequately design other support interventions to compensate for a change leader's potential under-emphasis or over-emphasis of some change implementation activities. For example, specific leadership development programs such as in-house and outsourced 10 In parallel, cross-validation of the results with alternative survey instruments will be informative. Although the GLII (Kets de <ref type="bibr" coords="14,410.40,658.05,35.21,6.03" target="#b64">Vries, 2002)</ref> was an appropriate tool to use to capture effectiveness at task-oriented and person-oriented behavior, it would be interesting to test our model using other established measurement instruments such as the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ), the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire Form XII (LBDQ-XII), or the Leader Opinion Questionnaire (Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, &amp; Welbourne, 2004) to measure effectiveness at task-oriented and person-oriented behaviors. educational programs, rotation systems, and training initiatives might be used to increase managers' awareness of the importance of activities they might be disposed to under-or over-emphasize.</p><p>To conclude, this study explores the relationship between leadership competencies and the way leaders manage the different activities of planned organizational change implementation. Our finding that their mix of leadership competencies might lead managers to differentially emphasize the key activities of planned organizational change implementation fuels growing appreciation that organizational change is a nuanced and highly differentiated process. An important question, of course, is what are the consequences of attending selectively to the three key activities of planned organizational change implementation? Is it suggested, for example, that the change will not be fully institutionalized, that the process will be more protracted, or that outcomes will be other than the intended outcomes? All of these questions merit further exploration.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="8,36.85,55.18,460.22,134.44"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Sample statistics and bivariate correlations.</figDesc><table coords="8,36.85,80.41,460.22,109.21">Variable

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">The chi-squared statistic, a standard measure of model fit, is 35.398, with df = 32 and p-value = 0.311. This strongly shows that the model fits well. Because the chi-squared statistic is strongly dependent on sample size, a number of other measures are used in the literature to substantiate the model fit (and establish its robustness), including GFI (goodness-of-fit index-0.90 or better is considered good), CFI (comparative-fit-index-0.90 or better is considered good), and RMSEA (root-mean-square error or approximation-0.05 or less is considered good). On these grounds, too, the model demonstrates a good fit (GFI, CFI N 0.9, RMSEA b0.05).</note>
