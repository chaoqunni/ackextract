Clearly, globalization is a very complex process involving the simultaneous operation of global blending and local segregating forces. Globalization comes with a subtle interaction of tendencies toward universalism and particularism <ref type="bibr" coords="2,295.15,357.16,87.33,8.58;2,75.86,369.18,66.85,8.58">(Robertson and Khonder 1998, p. 28)</ref>, produces homogenization and heterogenization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,356.09,369.18,31.75,8.58;2,75.86,381.20,139.30,8.58">(Brady, Beckfield, and Zhao 2007, p. 317)</ref>, and is associated with clashes, conflicts, and tensions between Western and non-Western concepts of globalization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,75.86,405.18,149.34,8.58">(Robertson and Khonder 1998, p. 29</ref>).

By combining aspects of globalization with features of local templates, hybrid organizations embody alternative institutional practices that allow actors in local communities to solve the potential tensions between the global and the local <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.01,345.20,131.21,8.58" target="#b101">(Schneiberg and Clemens 2006)</ref>. As globalization acts as a boundary-blurring force triggering (partial) institutional convergence across the globe, our baseline expectation is that globalization goes hand in hand with the emergence and expansion of such hybrid organizational forms.</p><p>However, we argue that local conditions play an important role in this process. As the word "glocal" implies, the impact of globalization depends on the interpenetration of global forces and local responses <ref type="bibr" coords="3,333.47,417.20,64.46,8.58;3,85.89,429.16,60.72,8.58" target="#b95">(Robertson and Khonder 1998)</ref>.

In contrast, to understand the emergence of alternative templates, multilevel models are needed that theorize about how the higher-order context interacts with local conditions in shaping multiple outcomes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,85.89,513.18,95.14,8.58" target="#b14">Boone and Özcan 2014)</ref>.

Similarly, mainly qualitative research reveals that institutional change and the emergence of new templates are often constituted from building blocks of locally available existing institutions <ref type="bibr" coords="4,353.94,273.20,29.68,8.58;4,75.86,285.16,100.15,8.58" target="#b101">(Schneiberg and Clemens 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Our empirical context is the Turkish high school system in the period from 1985 to 2007. Education is an appropriate setting as educational systems experience strong homogenizing pressures due to globalization <ref type="bibr" coords="4,334.44,321.16,53.40,8.58;4,75.86,333.18,21.00,8.58" target="#b76">(Meyer et al. 1997)</ref>, which <ref type="bibr" coords="4,130.23,333.18,87.21,8.58">Guillén (2001, p. 244)</ref> refers to as "the worldwide spread of conformism in educational systems." Turkey is an interesting case study because there is a strong tension between the global Western version of modernism and local Islamic traditions, which is fueled by local religious polarization and secular-Islamic contestation. 2 A growing number of so-called Anatolian Imam Hatip schools can be regarded as a hybrid school form because they combine the curricula of two other school forms: Anatolian and Imam Hatip high schools. The former can be identified as cosmopolitan high schools whose educational curriculum embodies secularist and Western-oriented values, while the latter are traditional religious high schools <ref type="bibr" coords="4,318.62,441.18,69.32,8.58;4,75.85,453.19,120.18,8.58" target="#b13">(Boone, Divarci, and van Witteloostuijn 2011)</ref>. Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools are religious high schools, which also provide a Western type of education in foreign languages. Because there is considerable geographic heterogeneity in Turkey, we can study how the interplay between universalism (the extent of globalization at the national level) and different local (district-level) particularistic characteristics affects the founding rate of hybrid high schools (Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools) at the local (district) level.</p><p>2 Our references to "global" and "local" do not imply that the local is without any global aspects. After all, Islam is a religion that operates globally and that has been and still is very influential in a global context. Rather, for the sake of the argument, we use "global" and "globalization" as defined in much of the literature, with reference to Western cultural, economic, and political orientations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey</head><p>Our key contribution is that we examine organizations as carriers of ideologies related to globalization, emphasizing their important role in how communities adapt to and affect institutional change. This important role of organizations has been underemphasized in prior work in organizational sociology <ref type="bibr" coords="5,126.88,141.16,105.76,8.58">(Haveman and Rao 2006)</ref>. Consequently, we focus on the impact of the macrolevel globalization process on the microlevel emergence of organizational forms in a comparative context of different communities, emphasizing the role of local agency, interest, and resistance. Our study is a response to the "plea . . . for a comparative sociology of globalization that is sensitive to local variations and to how agency, interest, and resistance mediate the relationship between globalization causes and outcomes" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,363.91,213.16,33.91,8.58;5,85.89,225.18,51.42,8.58">(Guillén 2001, p. 235)</ref>. This research is required as we lack "theoretical perspectives that bridge the micro-macro gap, i.e., that move across levels of analysis from the world system to the nation-state, the industry, sector, community, organization, and group. . . . We still know little about . . . its consequences on such key sociological variables as organizational patterns" (p. 255).</p><p>We find considerable support for the global-local interaction hypotheses about the emergence of hybrid high schools in Turkey, which clearly underscores the saliency of recent pleas of institutional theorists that dynamic analyses of institutions and change require a focus on heterogeneity and the emergence of alternative templates <ref type="bibr" coords="5,233.75,333.18,129.63,8.58" target="#b101">(Schneiberg and Clemens 2006)</ref>. Before we present our context-specific hypotheses, we first provide a rich description of the dynamics of the Turkish high school system in a country that has experienced growing religious polarization together with a rising interconnectedness with the world system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Century of Religious Polarization in Turkey</head><p>Even though the official history of Turkey as a nation-state begins with the foundation of the secular republic in 1923, with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk as its first president, the beginning of Turkish modernity can be traced back to 1839 with the start of the Tanzimat era <ref type="bibr" coords="5,245.99,481.20,48.04,8.58" target="#b56">(Kaya 2004)</ref>. 3 During this era, the Ottoman intelligentsia began to question the reasons behind the superiority of the West. This led to the emergence of new intellectual groups such as the Young Ottomans, who established the first constitutional regime in 1876. This era already includes the traces of the Kemalist modernization project. For example, secularism became an important topic of discussion in this period <ref type="bibr" coords="5,104.94,553.20,44.18,8.58" target="#b56">(Kaya 2004</ref>). The Tanzimat era ended in 1878. Three decades later, the Young Turks (a new group based on the ideas of the Young Ottomans) succeeded to establish the second constitutional regime by launching a military coup in 1908 and formed the first modern political party, İttihat Terakki. Although the establishment of this second constitutional regime solved some of the problems in society, it also paved the way for a tradition of military coups in the history of the Turkish Republic <ref type="bibr" coords="6,261.13,153.18,48.55,8.58" target="#b56">(Kaya 2004)</ref>. The reforms during the Tanzimat period included transformations of many institutions, including the education system. Although the transformed education system was still centered on religion, the bureaucrats of the Tanzimat era also included positive sciences in the curricula in addition to the religious courses, in order to increase the quality of education <ref type="bibr" coords="6,262.89,213.16,52.24,8.58" target="#b110">(Somel 2001)</ref>.</p><p>As a military officer influenced by the Young Turks, Ataturk tried to transform the remains of the Ottoman Empire into a modern, Western-oriented state, based on secular principles with reforms that, for example, unified education, abolished the Sharia, and introduced a modern Swiss-inspired civil code after the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Gender equality was formally recognized, and women obtained the right to vote and become elected in parliament. These reforms were accompanied by several cultural and symbolic measures such as the replacement of Arabic by Latin script and the prohibition against wearing a fez. The Kemalist modernization project represented a major revolution in a basically conservative and traditional Islamic society. During the single-party era, however, there was no room for competing ideas or for any platform to express social discontent <ref type="bibr" coords="6,75.86,369.18,60.23,8.58" target="#b114">(Zürcher 2004)</ref>. The interpretation of secularism in this era was not limited to the separation of the state and religion, but also involved the removal of religion from public life and control over religious institutions <ref type="bibr" coords="6,325.93,393.16,57.82,8.58" target="#b114">(Zürcher 2004)</ref>.

In fact, the Kemalist reforms lie at the very origin of the gradual rise of political Islam in the second half of the 20th century <ref type="bibr" coords="6,75.86,441.18,74.57,8.58" target="#b97">(Sakallıoğlu 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,153.02,441.18,44.70,8.58" target="#b84">Önis 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,200.30,441.18,51.95,8.58" target="#b38">Güven 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Military officers and civilian bureaucrats-the major power holders in the authoritarian state-imposed the westernization project unilaterally during the single-party era in the republic's history until 1946 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,337.78,477.18,50.12,8.58;6,75.86,489.20,21.00,8.58" target="#b97">(Sakallıoğlu 1996)</ref>. Eventually, so much contention arose that the state had to allow parties other than the Republican People's Party into the political arena at the end of World War II. The importance of the opposition is demonstrated by the huge victory of the center-right Democratic Party (DP), which gained 53.4% of the votes in the 1950 elections-a party that claimed to represent the periphery against the secular, bureaucratic intelligentsia. One of the first actions of the new government was to relax the dominance of secularism that had been a feature of the single-party era <ref type="bibr" coords="6,269.13,573.16,60.23,8.58" target="#b114">(Zürcher 2004)</ref>. The government introduced voluntary religious courses into primary schools, restored Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey the Arabic instead of the Turkish call to prayer, and established Imam Hatip (i.e., preacher) schools and a faculty of divinity at Ankara University. For the secularists who had internalized Kemalist principles-such as civil servants, academics, and military officers-this relaxation was a threat to their cultural and political hegemony <ref type="bibr" coords="7,245.03,141.16,60.57,8.58" target="#b114">(Zürcher 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The DP government ended in 1960 with a military coup. The Turkish army has always considered itself the guardian of Kemalist principles and was uncomfortable with the DP's policies. The DP was closed down and banned from politics. After the army handed over power to a newly elected government in 1961, a period of liberalization followed. The 1960s were a decade in which ideologies clashed and became a matter of public debate <ref type="bibr" coords="7,85.89,225.18,57.12,8.58" target="#b66">(Landau 1997)</ref>. In 1970, the National Order Party (NOP), the first pro-Islamic party of the Turkish Republic, was founded. Even though NOP's party program emphasized democratic values, the party firmly stood for freedom of religion and Islamic education.

However, the NOP was banned in 1971 because it violated the secularist principles of the Turkish Constitution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Blending Force of Globalization in Turkey</head><p>Ever since the foundation of the Turkish Republic, the country has been going through economic and social changes that originally took root in the westernization movement of Ottoman society in the 19th century. However, these changes have brought along their own internal conflicts <ref type="bibr" coords="9,315.16,145.18,77.49,8.58;9,85.89,157.20,38.18,8.58" target="#b17">(Çarkoğlu and Toprak 2007)</ref>. Specifically, this process of change created conflict between the supporters of Western-style modernization and the countermovements reacting against such westernization. Moreover, even though Turkish modernization has been a project of the state since the foundation of the Turkish Republic, the integration of the Turkish economy into the global marketplace began only in the 1980s with economic liberalization <ref type="bibr" coords="9,340.05,217.18,57.82,8.58;9,85.89,229.20,62.33,8.58" target="#b60">(Keyman and Koyuncu 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Turgut Ozal, the nineteenth prime minister of Turkey and one of the architects of the Turkish Islamic synthesis, introduced a series of transformative policies paving the way for economic liberalization, as well as the reestablishment of parliamentary democracy after the 1980 military coup. The aim of the economic policies of this period was to shift from a protectionist and import-substitution approach to a liberal and market-oriented strategy instead <ref type="bibr" coords="9,118.15,313.16,158.31,8.58" target="#b43">(Harrison, Rutherford, and Tarr 1993)</ref>. The reason behind this radical shift was the fact that the Turkish economy had been suffering from structural constraints to growth for some years. The solution introduced by the liberal government was the integration of the Turkish economy into the world capitalist system (Ardiç 2009). This integration process was not only initiated by government policies but also stimulated through structural adjustment programs organized by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank <ref type="bibr" coords="9,158.06,397.18,101.79,8.58" target="#b23">(Cizre and Yeldan 2005)</ref>. As a result of the liberalization policies, Turkey developed economic relationships with several countries and gained access to a range of export markets. However, rapid economic development required large capital imports because domestic savings were insufficient for the required investment. In this period, foreign investors were attracted by Turkey's great economic potential and increasingly liberal economic policies; as a result, the amount of foreign capital invested in Turkey increased rapidly <ref type="bibr" coords="9,206.25,481.20,45.88,8.58" target="#b3">(Ardıç 2009</ref>).</p><p>The globalization process that took off with Turkey's integration into global capitalism also had political and social consequences. First, the economic international relations of Turkey improved through increasing trade and foreign direct investment. Second, as a consequence of economic development and advanced communication technologies, global connectivity and global consciousness increased. The most prominent reflections of global culture in Turkey can be seen in the patterns of consumption and in the lifestyle of its inhabitants <ref type="bibr" coords="9,176.03,577.19,75.08,8.58" target="#b52">(Helvacioglu 2000)</ref>.

The first Anatolian high schools were established by the government in 1955 as alternatives to international (e.g., French, German, or Italian) high schools that provided high-quality and foreign language education in Turkey. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,222.18,140.76,3.00,4.58">6</ref> In the meantime, as the impact of globalization intensified, these schools became more and more popular among the secular faction mainly because these schools do not force any type of religion on the students and at the same time provide high-quality education including foreign languages-both seen as a first step for a student to become connected to the rest of the world.</p><p>On the other side of the ideological spectrum, Imam Hatip high schools provide religious education. Although the aim of Ataturk was to provide one unified, secular educational system, one of the major strategies of the Islamic movement was the creation of a counterelite by gradually strengthening the Islamic stream in the educational system <ref type="bibr" coords="12,277.57,261.18,54.56,8.58" target="#b38">(Güven 2005)</ref>. 7 As a result, during the 20th century, the number of Imam Hatip high schools expanded so much that duality in education became a fact <ref type="bibr" coords="12,280.01,285.16,54.85,8.58" target="#b38">(Güven 2005)</ref>. Depending on the ruling government's views, the Imam Hatip schools went through several changes over time.

Even though Imam Hatip high schools were originally founded to educate imams and preachers, because of the resurgence of Islam during the 1950s and after a series of regulatory changes <ref type="bibr" coords="12,313.47,369.18,42.14,8.58" target="#b87">(Pak 2004)</ref>, Imam Hatip high schools have become regular educational institutions, preparing students for higher education. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,201.88,392.76,3.00,4.58">8</ref> The main characteristic of Imam Hatip high schools is that they provide vocational courses as well as standard arts and science classes.

Therefore, the Turkish state decided to establish its own cosmopolitan schools. 7 Ataturk's aim was to keep religion and religious activities under the control of the secular state; this strategy also extended to the educational system. The Ottoman Empire had a multiplicity of schools, which all had a religious component in their curriculum <ref type="bibr" coords="12,75.85,520.19,44.27,7.29" target="#b110">(Somel 2001)</ref>.

As a result, Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools can be seen as a hybrid school form. The Imam Hatip high schools include substantial religious education in addition to the standard arts and science classes while they provide scant English-language training. For the newly emerged devout bourgeois class, the question was which type of education they wanted their children to have. Because of the intensification of globalization, Imam Hatip high schools lost their attractiveness to religious parents because these schools could not accommodate the upcoming global values, norms, and practices. The new hybrid high school form offered a solution by including religious education along with the high-quality foreign language education essential in allowing their graduates to connect with the rest of the world. Yet, unlike Anatolian high schools, the curriculum of Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools includes courses such as Arabic, theology, and holy Qur'an as well as standard courses like mathematics and natural sciences (Turkish Ministry of Education, General Directorate of Religious Education). In parallel to the changes in the world and in Turkish society, conservative and religious parents preferred their children be educated in modern schools that taught foreign languages, had computer labs, and offered sports facilities <ref type="bibr" coords="13,176.66,465.16,60.34,8.58" target="#b35">(Gökaçtı 2005)</ref>.

Figures 2 and 3 provide the relative densities of the different school forms. As can be seen from the figures, the dominant high school type in Turkey is the regular high school. In 2007, 55% of all public high schools were regular high schools, but this percentage had dropped dramatically from 72% in 1985.

The relative importance of both Anatolian and Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools substantially increased over time (also demonstrated by their growing densities; see <ref type="figure" coords="14,288.34,314.91,13.00,10.00">fig.</ref> 2), at the expense of the dominant regular high schools and the traditional Imam Hatip high schools (for which growth seems to stagnate). <ref type="figure" coords="14,265.38,339.75,35.27,8.58">Figure 3</ref> exhibits the growing popularity of Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools among the religious faction.</p><p>What makes the Turkish high school system highly appropriate for our purposes is that the growth of the density of Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools varies widely across localities in Turkey, defined as districts.

This demand is met in two ways. First, the Turkish Ministry of Education, which is responsible for top-down decisions about the location, number, and type of high schools to be established in the different districts, takes into account the needs of local communities. Second, bottom-up, the local community can request a certain type of school in their district by making a demand to the corresponding governor, who in turn transmits this request to the Ministry of Education. Moreover, if the local community donates the necessary buildings and equipment to the state for a new school, then the government gives permission for the founding of the school and assigns teaching staff. As a result, the founding process of high schools in Turkey is both a top-down and a bottom-up process, implying that both local conditions and local collective actions are important drivers of new school formation. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,304.38,380.74,3.00,4.58">9</ref> HYPOTHESIS 1.-The district-level founding rate of hybrid high schools (Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools) increases with globalization.</p></div>

The perception and practice of religion, however, are not homogeneously distributed across Turkey. In some regions, the devout bourgeoisie became an important new social class (e.g., in Anatolia); in other regions, there are still many Islamic factions that strongly oppose Western-type modernity. These cultural and ideological differences between localities affect how people react to forces of globalization and, hence, the extent to which hybrid school forms will emerge (Marquis and Battilana 2009). <ref type="bibr" coords="16,181.70,549.18,48.65,8.58" target="#b58">Kern (2010)</ref> argues that adaptation to global practices requires cultural resonance.

Therefore, in the current study, we decided to employ the KOF index of globalization, which explicitly accounts for the multidimensional nature of globalization.</p><p>The KOF index represents an attempt to develop a broad measure of the extent of globalization of a country. This index has been accepted in recent empirical literature as a valid measure and was first presented in 2002, covering 123 countries and including 23 variables <ref type="bibr" coords="22,283.98,225.18,55.47,8.58" target="#b29">(Dreher 2006)</ref>. The index includes economic, political, and social dimensions of globalization. Each of these three dimensions is further divided into subdimensions. Economic globalization of a country is described by actual economic flows (trade, foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and income payments to foreign nationals, each measured as a percentage of GDP) and the absence of restrictions (hidden import barriers, mean tariff rate, taxes on international trade, and capital account restrictions). Political globalization is measured with the number of foreign embassies, memberships of international organizations, and participation in the UN Security Council missions.

These organizations can be classified as nongovernmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations. All these organizational actors play their role in global politics and are considered as an important indicator of globalization. The increase in the number of international organizations constitutes an institution-building process, reflecting the relative power of international and global political actors (Chase-Dunn 1999). Hence, the number of international organizations in a country is an indicator of this country's degree of integration into the global world.

All models are estimated using the XTGEE routine of version 10.0 of Stata.</p><p>A few other estimation-related issues are worth mentioning. First, we checked for nonstationarity of our dependent variable, as this might lead to spurious relationships. <ref type="figure" coords="26,183.29,561.20,35.44,8.58" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> plots the number of foundings of hybrid high schools over time. Visual inspection suggests that this time series is not trended and, thus, stationary. Given that there are no exit events in Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey the period under study, the founding count is, in fact, a first-difference variable of hybrid school density at time t minus t 2 1. It is well established that even nonstationary series generally become stationary after taking the first difference. A Fisher type unit root test for unbalanced panel data formally reveals that we can reject the null hypothesis that all district-level time series are nonstationary against the alternative hypothesis that at least one series in our panel is stationary. <ref type="bibr" coords="27,209.65,344.74,6.01,4.58">18</ref> We continued with Dickey-Fuller unit root tests for each district separately.

Of course, by doing so, we filter out the between-district variation that is essential from the perspective of our theoretical logic, which stresses the importance of geographical heterogeneity in explaining whether and how local communities adjust to globalization. An additional drawback of fixed effects in this setting is that we lose the observations of the few districts that never experienced a founding event (i.e., 58 district-year observations). However, notwithstanding this removal of theoretically relevant cross-district heterogeneity, which comes with drops in significance levels, <ref type="bibr" coords="27,85.89,538.13,6.00,4.58">18</ref> Note that we have 81 panels (districts).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations are reported in table 1. Table 2 provides our GEE negative binomial regression estimates of the founding rate of hybrid high schools at the district level.</p><p>We first focus on the effects of globalization and the control variables. Model 1 reveals that the main effect of globalization is significantly positive (B 5 .10; P &lt; .001), providing support for hypothesis 1 predicting that globalization spurs the founding rate of hybrid high schools. In addition, national GDP growth and percentage of educational expenditures have a positive impact on hybrid high school founding. Moreover, Marmara being the omitted region, we observe that the hybrid high school founding rate is lower in eastern, southeastern, and central Anatolian regions. At the district level, district population and the most religious votes have a positive effect, whereas secular-religious polarization has a negative impact on the emergence of hybrid high schools. 20 Density of regular high schools does not have any significant effect. The model 1 estimates further suggest that the densities of Imam Hatip and Anatolian high schools both have a positive influence on the emergence of hybrid high schools (B 5 .14 and B 5 .06, respectively; for both estimates, P &lt; .001), suggesting positive spillover effects of the parent templates.</p><p>A perhaps counterintuitive finding is the significantly negative sign of lagged hybrid school density. After all, the increase in the number of hybrid high schools in a district could have a legitimation effect, predicting a positive sign. What may explain our negative coefficient is a carrying capacity effect. That is, in a district with a certain population size, there is a natural limit to the demand for a certain high school type, which puts an upper boundary to the number of high schools of that type that can be viably established in a district. To check for this interpretation, we ran the models without the densities of other high school types: the results reported in the article do not change (including the sign of the lagged density of hybrid high schools; the results are available on request). In addition, we ran the same models by <ref type="bibr" coords="28,75.86,530.59,6.00,4.58">20</ref> The finding that the traditional Islamic votes and ideological polarization have a positive and negative main effect, respectively, on the founding rate of hybrid schools might seem surprising at first glance. However, note that in subsequent models we show that these variables significantly interact with globalization, making the interpretation of main effects not very meaningful. On a more substantive level, the overall pattern of findings reported below suggests that the impact of globalization on hybrid school foundings is very strong even in communities that might resist and that the local context mainly attenuates the overwhelming force of globalization. replacing the dependent variable (founding rate of hybrid high schools) with the founding rate of Imam Hatip high schools and Anatolian high schools, one by one, with and without the density of the other high school types (available on request). We found negative (and significant) coefficients for the lagged densities of Imam Hatip and Anatolian high schools, respectively, in all these supplementary analyses. These findings offer further support for our carrying capacity explanation of the negative sign of the coefficient of the lagged density of hybrid high schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey</head><p>In model 2, we see that the proportion of the most religious votes (traditional Islamic votes) attenuates the impact of globalization on the hybrid high school founding rate (B 5 2.002; P &lt; .05). 21 Strong support for a traditional interpretation of Islam apparently hampers the local community from adapting to global norms because of a lack of resonance between the global and the local, a finding that is in line with hypothesis 2.</p><p>In model 3, we report the three-way interaction of the KOF globalization index and the densities of Imam Hatip and Anatolian high schools to test for hypothesis 3's prediction that the joint presence of both parent forms moderates the impact of globalization by providing the institutional repertoire for hybrid high school formation. The two-way interactions of both densities with globalization separately are negative, but the three-way interaction is significantly positive as expected (B 5 .003; P &lt; .01). This pattern of findings underscores that the positive impact of globalization on hybrid high school foundings increases when both types of parent high schools are prevalent in the district.</p><p>In model 4, we find support for hypothesis 4. The effect of globalization on hybrid high school formation increases with the growth in the number of employers in a local district (B 5 .01; P &lt; .05). This finding suggests that a strong entrepreneurial climate in a district provides the economic incentives to adapt to global norms, values, and practices by blending the local with the global. Finally, the estimates of model 5 offer evidence for hypothesis 5, showing a significantly positive interaction coefficient between the KOF globalization index and ideological polarization (B 5 .21; P &lt; .001). Secular-religious polarization acts as a mobilizing force for rival ideologies, triggering the ideological incentives for local adaptation when globalization increases.</p><p>To further explore our argument, we performed a post hoc analysis by estimating model 6, which includes the interaction between religious votes (hypothesis 2), on the one hand, and the growth of the number of employers 21 Note that, for the traditional Islamic votes variable, we included only the political parties that receive a score of 10 on the religiosity scale.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness Analyses</head><p>In our main analyses reported in this article, we decided against including (lagged) GDP per capita because of the high correlation of this control variable with our (lagged) KOF globalization index (.87), which causes potential problems due to multicollinearity. It is well known that this inflates standard errors of estimates, reducing t-statistics and significance levels. However, to disentangle the effect of these variables, we compared models with both variables entered separately and simultaneously (results are available on request). Both GDP per capita and the KOF globalization index are significantly positively related to the founding rate of hybrid high schools when entered separately in the regression equation. However, when entered simultaneously, the estimate of GDP per capita becomes insignificant, even with a negative sign, whereas the effect of the KOF index is not affected compared to the estimate reported in model 1 of table 2 (i.e., B 5 .11; P &lt; .001). This comparative analysis suggests that the emergence of hybrid high schools is indeed driven by globalization, and not by the steady growth of GDP per capita during our observation window, notwithstanding the fact that both are strongly related because globalization has had a huge impact on subsequent economic growth in Turkey (see also the comparison between both time series in figs. 1 and 4 discussed above). <ref type="bibr" coords="33,182.61,392.76,6.01,4.58">22</ref> Second, we ran an analysis with the number of nonprofit international organizations (IOs) that have headquarters in Turkey as an alternative measure of globalization, replacing the (lagged) KOF globalization index with the (lagged) number of IOs headquartered in Turkey (results are available on request).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this article, we analyze the impact of globalization on the emergence of hybrid organizational forms, finding support for a positive main effect. We propose that the impact of globalization depends on three local characteristics: the potential misfit between global and local ideas, values, and practices (local resistance); the presence of institutional repertoire to blend into hybrid organizational forms (local templates); and the motivation of the local community to adapt to global ideas, values, and practices (local incentives). We test our hypotheses in the setting of Islamic education in Turkey between 1985 and 2007. In this period, Turkey experienced a growing impact of globalization in combination with the rise of an Islamic movement, with large variation across the country. This setting is highly appropriate for our purposes, with clear forces of globalization and localization operating next to one another.</p><p>Regarding the effect of local resistance, our evidence suggests that in the most religious, traditional local communities, the impact of globalization on hybrid high school formation is attenuated. The more local people vote on the most religious parties, the less likely local high schools are established that blend cosmopolitan and religious norms, values, and practices into a hybrid form in response to increasing globalization. Then globalization presents a threat to local traditions, as westernization clashes with the local, which triggers strong resistance among the large traditionalist fraction of the community against the global model of education. This in turn hampers the willingness of the local community to recombine global and traditional educational templates into a hybrid school form. Such communities are less susceptible to adapting to global boundary-blurring forces, which often demarcates traditional boundaries between the global and the local more sharply <ref type="bibr" coords="34,349.35,525.20,38.51,8.58;34,75.86,537.16,81.55,8.58">(Marquis and Batillana 2009)</ref>.</p><p>As far as the role of local templates is concerned, we find that the founding rate of the hybrid high school form increases with the number of parent high school forms, namely, Anatolian and Imam Hatip high schools. As a consequence of the experience of the local community with different organizational parent forms and the legitimacy that spills over from these parent templates to their combination in hybrid forms, the establishment of Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools is facilitated. The presence of parent forms in a local community together with increases in globalization, therefore, spur hybrid high school founding. This underscores the observation that "thinkable" alternative templates that emerge in response to societal change are often building on existing institutions <ref type="bibr" coords="36,229.04,153.18,109.27,8.58">(Haveman and Rao 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="36,341.46,153.18,46.50,8.58;36,75.86,165.19,78.20,8.58" target="#b101">Schneiberg and Clemens 2006)</ref>. Relating to local incentives, we find that the impact of globalization on the founding rate of hybrid high schools increases with the growth in the number of employers in a local district, as well as with secular-religious polarization. This provides evidence for our claim that both economic and ideological incentives trigger local communities to respond to forces of globalization by establishing hybrid organizational forms that blend the global with the local. That is, a strong local entrepreneurial culture that resonates with economic globalization stimulates adaptation to benefit economically from globalization. Local ideological polarization is another mobilizing force as this intensifies direct ideological competition among different community fractions. Because of globalization, cosmopolitan education based on scientific, rational principles gained importance all over the world. <ref type="bibr" coords="36,313.12,308.74,6.01,4.58">23</ref> In such circumstances, more traditional members of a community are incentivized to adjust to the Western model of education to keep up with the secular fraction in a globalizing world. One way is to insert key elements of the cosmopolitan template of education in Islamic education without sacrificing one's religious identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey</head><p>In post hoc analyses, we further explored the underlying mechanism by estimating the interaction between the most religious votes and growth in the number of employers. Although the proportion of the most religious votes has a negative moderating effect on the hybrid high school founding rate, we find that such local communities do adapt to the global world when the community has a strong local entrepreneurship culture. One interpretation is that adaptation is then instrumental for the traditional religious community in the sense that the local religious population is motivated to blend the global with the local in order to gain from this economically without sacrificing too much their local identity. A hybrid organizational form such as the Anatolian Imam Hatip high school serves this purpose by merging key elements of cosmopolitan education into an otherwise Islamic teaching tradition.</p><p>We ran a series of additional analyses to explore the robustness of our findings. Indeed, our results survive changes in the estimation method, the 23 Following Meyer (2000), we use "rationalism" to refer to the convergence of educational templates based on science. According to Meyer and his colleagues, both organizations and actors are subject to standardizing rationalization because of globalization that arises from a scientific analysis of nature as universal and lawful.</p><p>Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey set of control variables, or the measure of globalization. Substantively, the robustness analyses regarding the different dimensions of globalizationeconomic, political, and social-are particularly interesting. These analyses reveal that economic and, particularly, social globalization is important to explain the emergence of hybrid high school forms, whereas political globalization is not. Indeed, this finding is in line with our result that economic and ideological incentives provide the motivation to adapt to the global while preserving the local. Apparently, political globalization per se does not suffice to affect people's motivation, perhaps because such globalization does not seriously affect the local communities' norms and values. This underscores that globalization is also an ideology <ref type="bibr" coords="37,283.24,213.16,57.51,8.58" target="#b37">(Guillén 2001)</ref>, which takes time to become part of the cultural mind-set of local communities. As a result, it is unsurprising that the social dimension of globalization reveals the largest effects on the emergence of hybrid high schools in Turkey.</p><p>Post hoc, we also estimated models to further explore the effect of our main variables on the founding rate of Anatolian and Imam Hatip high schools (results are available on request). These analyses reveal that globalization has a significantly positive impact on the founding of Anatolian high schools, as these schools are the carriers of cosmopolitan values and norms ever since their foundation. However, globalization has a significantly negative effect on the founding of Imam Hatip high schools, as they are out of tune with the increasing influence of globalization. Conversely, a larger share of the most religious votes has a negative main impact on the founding rate of Anatolian high schools but stimulates the founding rate of Imam Hatip high schools. Interestingly, polarization reduces the founding rate of Imam Hatip high schools (but not that of the Anatolian schools). Overall, the results from these supplementary analyses reflect our main findings regarding Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools. The pattern of findings suggests that two trends dominate in Turkey. On the one hand, a globalization trend spurs cosmopolitan education, boosting Anatolian high school founding; on the other hand, local religious traditions oppose this trend, favoring Imam Hatip high school founding (and more so when globalization pressures increase). Only when local polarization is high do local communities (with the most religious voters) "adjust" to increasing globalization by the establishment of hybrid Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools.</p><p>In this study, we built on institutional and glocalization theories and combined those with insights from organizational ecology in order to understand the impact of globalization on the emergence and expansion of hybrid organizational forms. Hence, our article contributes to the literature in several ways. First, until recently, most institutional theory has mainly focused on how higher-order institutional pressures affect lower-level mimetic behavior leading to field-level convergence <ref type="bibr" coords="37,261.53,585.18,132.12,8.58" target="#b101">(Schneiberg and Clemens 2006)</ref>. Communities and organizations are regarded as relatively passive recipients American Journal of Sociology of top-down institutional pressures (DiMaggio and Powell 1983), giving a somewhat "deterministic" flavor to institutional theory <ref type="bibr" coords="38,304.95,105.16,78.99,8.58;38,75.86,117.17,36.72,8.58">(Marquis and Batillana 2009</ref>). Our approach underscores the important role of agency and contestation in whether and how actors are willing to adjust to these pressures. How institutional pressures, such as globalization processes, unfold depends on place-bound features and therefore requires a systematic study of the heterogeneity among communities and their organizations. The bottom line is that actors have a range of responses available when facing institutional pressure (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="38,151.60,189.18,50.64,8.58" target="#b82">Oliver 1991)</ref>. Building on glocalization theory, we show that local cultures may critically adapt or resist global phenomena and that the creation of localities is a standard component of globalization <ref type="bibr" coords="38,341.98,213.16,45.89,8.58;38,75.86,225.18,79.66,8.58" target="#b95">(Robertson and Khonder 1998)</ref>. In order to understand when, where, and why hybrid organizational forms emerge as a reaction to globalization, it is important to analyze the local characteristics that moderate the impact of globalization. Our study is one of the first systematic, comparative empirical studies analyzing the impact of this interplay on the emergence of hybrid organizational forms, focusing on the role of local resistance, local templates, and local incentives.</p><p>The usefulness of this comparative institutional approach is witnessed by the fact that it allows us to reconcile the many conflicting outcomes of globalization that have been discussed in the literature, ranging from convergence via hybridization to divergence. Indeed, our findings suggest that the specific outcome of globalization depends on local conditions in a predictable way. We also show that different versions of modernity might emerge depending on the specific interplay between the global and the local. Modernity is therefore not inherently globalizing, as <ref type="bibr" coords="38,265.38,393.16,62.48,8.58" target="#b34">Giddens (1990)</ref> argued. Globalization is an ideology subject to contestation <ref type="bibr" coords="38,265.60,405.18,55.74,8.58" target="#b37">(Guillén 2001)</ref>. What Western people define as modernity is not what other movements such as Islam and Marxism claim <ref type="bibr" coords="38,142.58,429.16,71.28,8.58" target="#b94">(Robertson 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="38,216.85,429.16,54.95,8.58" target="#b37">Guillén 2001)</ref>. Out of contestation, alternative models emerge, fueling pluralistic identities that compete for dominance. As Geertz <ref type="bibr" coords="38,150.58,453.20,56.39,8.58">(1998, p. 107;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="38,209.82,453.20,92.96,8.58">cited by Guillén 2001)</ref> observes, the world "is growing both more global and more divided, more thoroughly interconnected and intricately partitioned at the same time."</p><p>In the context of our study, the diffusion of the hybrid high school form that educates young people to become world citizens who compete for elite functions illustrates that Islam is becoming a global force itself, defining a competing logic in parallel with Western modernity. This is also demonstrated by the steady growth of the Gülen movement, a transnational religious and social force that has been described as the world's most global movement <ref type="bibr" coords="38,124.16,561.20,48.81,8.58" target="#b36">(Göle 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="38,176.77,561.20,47.42,8.58" target="#b63">Kuru 2003)</ref>. This movement, led by the Turkish Muslim thinker Fethullah Gülen, is active in education with schools in more than 140 countries and also invests in media, finance, and for-profit health clinics. The education offered by the Gülen movement is similar to that of Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey the Turkish hybrid high schools, blending global rationalized principles of education with Islam. The purpose is to form a new synthesis between science and religion, reason and revelation, and progress and conservatism inspired by Islam <ref type="bibr" coords="39,152.73,129.19,50.31,8.58" target="#b63">(Kuru 2003)</ref> and to encourage practicing Muslims to be active participants in a globalizing world. Unsurprisingly, this movement, in turn, is contested in Western nation-states, such as in the United States and the Netherlands, questioning the good intentions of the movement.</p><p>Our study also contributes to organizational ecology, which has a particular interest in explaining where and why new organizational forms emerge to understand the dynamics of organizational diversity <ref type="bibr" coords="39,318.90,201.19,78.97,8.58;39,85.89,213.16,22.50,8.58" target="#b73">(McKendrick et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="39,111.35,213.16,101.48,8.58" target="#b14">Boone and Özcan 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="39,215.78,213.16,77.12,8.58" target="#b11">Bogaert et al. 2016</ref>). This literature further recognizes that organizations are important carriers of ideology that fuel contestation, social change, and adaptation <ref type="bibr" coords="39,272.47,237.19,125.40,8.58" target="#b6">(Barnett and Woywode 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="39,85.89,249.16,107.03,8.58" target="#b108">Simons and Ingram 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="39,194.97,249.16,76.79,8.58" target="#b109">Sine and Lee 2009)</ref>. For instance, cooperative organizations often emerge in response to corporations out of anticorporate sentiments in order to defend the "commonwealth" logic against the dominant "mass market" logic <ref type="bibr" coords="39,294.69,285.16,99.01,8.58" target="#b14">Boone and Özcan 2014)</ref>. In a similar vein, the educational system responds to globalization by building hybrid schools that serve the purpose of defining and diffusing an alternative form of Islamic modernism. Clearly, organizations are important vehicles of institutional change. Therefore, the study of how organizational dynamics coevolve with institutions is of great importance, although this issue received insufficient attention in prior work <ref type="bibr" coords="39,287.49,357.16,106.21,8.58">(Haveman and Rao 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Our particular focus on explaining the emergence of hybrid organizational forms implies an additional contribution. Because hybrid organizational forms build on existing institutional templates, they represent institutional carriers that allow for incremental institutional change, as opposed to discontinuous change, where one logic is discarded and replaced <ref type="bibr" coords="39,369.30,417.20,23.80,8.58;39,85.89,429.16,79.81,8.58">(Haveman and Rao 2006)</ref>. Despite their importance, little attention has been paid to the processes that lead to the emergence of hybrid forms and under which conditions boundaries dissolve to produce hybridity <ref type="bibr" coords="39,308.30,453.20,89.57,8.58;39,85.89,465.16,20.60,8.58" target="#b65">(Lamont and Molnar 2002)</ref>. In this article, we analyze the role of globalization on institutional change that leads to the mixing of blueprints belonging to opposing categories, which is a widely neglected topic in the literature <ref type="bibr" coords="39,308.02,489.20,64.57,8.58" target="#b91">(Rao et al. 2005)</ref>. This is an important omission, as literature shows that hybrid forms meet sharp punishment, particularly if the category codes are oppositional or involve moral imperatives <ref type="bibr" coords="39,166.11,525.20,115.59,8.58" target="#b62">(Kovács and Hannan 2010)</ref>. Our study suggests, however, that if the community has a lot at stake and therefore has a strong motivation for blending oppositional categories, then hybrid forms might emerge without getting penalized. Thus, to understand the emergence of hybrids, it is essential to take into account the underlying dynamics that trigger the adaptation process, such as the strong ideological polarization in Turkey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Journal of Sociology</head><p>Finally, our study contributes to the extensive research program on the worldwide diffusion of education systems by <ref type="bibr" coords="40,259.77,105.16,70.33,8.58" target="#b76">Meyer et al. (1997</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="40,335.85,105.16,16.80,8.58" target="#b77">Meyer et al. ( , 2010</ref>. These scholars argue and report empirical evidence that the expansion of rationalized modernity leads to enormous convergence in educational systems all over the world. Although the convergence process is well reflected in the literature (Anderson-Levitt 2003), research has paid less attention to the variation across different societies and the reasons behind this variation. In our study, we focused on a more fine-grained community-level analysis, showing that variation indeed matters. Although this seems to undermine the education-system convergence thesis, it is important to stress that <ref type="bibr" coords="40,343.45,201.19,44.41,8.58;40,75.85,213.16,61.43,8.58" target="#b78">Meyer and Hannan (1979)</ref> claimed that isomorphism relates to structural similarity (socalled similarities of form), however decoupled from purpose and intentions (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="40,110.10,237.19,52.45,8.58" target="#b37">Guillén 2001)</ref>. Interestingly, this seems to fit with the Anatolian Imam Hatip high schools we studied: the scientific/rational template is copied while the local religious-inspired values defining purpose and intentions are retained.</p><p>Our study is not without limitations, which provide opportunities for further research. Here, we would like to mention three such opportunities. First, our data offer the opportunity for more detailed studies of the underlying dynamics of district-level movements and countermovements in interaction with country-level globalization. For instance, we may examine the differences in the speed of adjustment (or the strength of resistance) across different Turkish districts in response to forces of globalization. Another example is a study of reversed causalities. In our specification, we took care of this by lagging our key independent variables, but this does not exclude an impact of district-level dynamics on globalization: the founding of cosmopolitan or hybrid high schools may foster forces that may contribute to globalization.</p><p>Second, there is the question as to the extent to which our results are generalizable to other settings. Given that globalization is a very broad topic and that there are many different studies in different fields, this question is difficult to answer. However, we see that similar hybrid organizational forms emerge as a consequence of globalization in other domains of society, an example being Islamic banks <ref type="bibr" coords="40,188.05,465.16,59.72,8.58" target="#b105">(Segrado 2005)</ref>. Islamic banks operate according to the principles of Islamic law. Yet, at the same time, the products and services provided by Islamic banks are similar to the ones offered by conventional banks. Islamic banks are hybrids in the sense of combining modern methods of business and finance with Islamic laws concerning economics. Another example is the emergence of the integrated Islamic high schools in Indonesia, also in the 1980s <ref type="bibr" coords="40,200.92,537.16,49.00,8.58" target="#b45">(Hasan 2009</ref>). These schools combine Islamic education with a modern curriculum, too, and are preferred by the elite class. The reasons behind the emergence of these hybrid school forms can probably be explained by local characteristics similar to the ones in Turkey, such as the growing entrepreneurial class in Indonesia. And another driver Emergence of Hybrid Islamic Schools in Turkey may well be the ideological polarization within the different sects of the Muslim population and between different religions <ref type="bibr" coords="41,303.14,105.16,54.00,8.58" target="#b45">(Hasan 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Third, of similar interest would be to study contexts in which hybrid organizational forms fail to emerge. Only then can we really understand the boundary conditions of our theory. The examples above suggest that the emergence of hybrid organizational forms follows from the presence of both segregating and blending forces, particularly for the emergence of hybrid forms that carry rival ideologies. In the Muslim world, Turkey might be a special case because of the powerful secular movement, as initiated by Ataturk in the early 20th century. Perhaps such a national secular policy is a precondition for embracing cosmopolitan and globalized patterns. For that reason, the emergence of hybrid schools in a country like Iran is not very likely because of the absence of strong blending forces. In future work, we hope to further develop the comparative perspective implied by the theory proposed in the current study. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="10,84.64,590.32,294.97,7.29"><head>FIG. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>-KOF globalization index and its three dimensions for Turkey</figDesc></figure>
