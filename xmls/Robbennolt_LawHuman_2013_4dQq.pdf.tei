<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Previous work has explored the influence that apologies have on the settlement of civil legal disputes. This study explored 2 aspects of apologies that commonly arise in the legal setting-the fact that many apologies may be negotiated with or requested from a wrongdoer in the context of settlement discussions and the possibility that an apology may be offered by a wrongdoer's attorney rather than personally by the offender. In general, apologies given following a negligent action were found to improve perceptions of the offender and the situation. Full apologies that were given in response to a request by the injured party or at the suggestion of a mediator were viewed in ways that were similar to the same apology given spontaneously. On the other hand, full apologies that were offered by an attorney on behalf of the wrongdoer, although improving perceptions somewhat, were less effective than apologies offered directly by the wrongdoer. The motives attributed to the apologizer and general attitudes toward the civil litigation system also influenced perceptions of apologies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Even though it may be appropriate to offer an apology to someone one has injured, fears of legal liability are often said to discourage apologies (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,176.38,402.54,111.67,7.91;1,48.00,413.54,103.66,7.91" target="#b16">Gallagher, Waterman, Ebers, Frasier, &amp; Levinson, 2003)</ref>. Defendants, defense counsel, and insurers worry that statements of apology will be admissible at trial and will be interpreted by fact-finders as admissions of responsibility. In recent years, however, both legal commentators and psychologists have begun to explore the effects of apologies offered in the context of civil harms (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,190.12,468.54,97.94,7.91;1,48.00,479.54,20.50,7.91" target="#b5">Bornstein, Rung, &amp; Miller, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,70.97,479.54,67.67,7.91" target="#b8">J.

Proponents of apologies in civil litigation believe that apologies will, among other things, avert lawsuits and promote and speed settlement, while providing greater satisfaction to injured parties and offenders (see, e.g., J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,123.60,556.54,50.07,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,177.50,556.54,51.98,7.91" target="#b45">Shuman, 2000</ref>; see review in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,48.00,567.54,66.62,7.91" target="#b36">Robbennolt, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Apologies, particularly those that accept responsibility for having caused harm, can change injured people's perceptions of and reactions to harm-causing incidents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,200.90,600.54,87.16,7.91" target="#b5">(Bornstein et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,48.00,611.54,84.81,7.91" target="#b10">Davis &amp; Gold, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,137.45,611.54,67.45,7.91" target="#b36">Robbennolt, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,213.74,611.54,16.09,7.91" target="#b37">Robbennolt, , 2006</ref>. In addition, apologies may fulfill needs that are not satisfied in the same way by monetary settlements or awards-providing assurance that the offender will not reoffend, affirming the importance of the rule that was violated and the social standing of the injured person, and conveying information (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,460.26,387.27,85.78,7.91" target="#b17">Gold &amp; Weiner, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.00,398.57,57.44,7.91" target="#b45">Shuman, 2000)</ref>. Accordingly, apologies have been shown to change people's approach to settlement, affecting their bottomline goals, their aspirations, and their perceptions of what settlement outcome would be fair <ref type="bibr" coords="1,442.23,432.49,73.45,7.91" target="#b37">(Robbennolt, 2006)</ref>. These types of settlement levers have been found to act as reference points that influence final settlement decisions (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,527.52,455.11,13.90,7.91;1,306.00,466.41,51.71,7.91" target="#b22">Kahneman, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,361.06,466.41,106.59,7.91" target="#b51">S. B. White &amp; Neale, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Apologies offered in the context of civil litigation, however, entail some unique complications. First, the desire to receive an apology from an actor who has caused injury raises the possibility that many apologies will be "negotiated" between the parties as part of the settlement process. Just as criminal defendants may sometimes be compelled to apologize to their victims, usually as a condition of probation (see B. T. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,520.89,545.56,25.14,7.91;1,306.00,556.87,20.12,7.91" target="#b50">White, 2006)</ref>, so too may civil defendants find themselves subject to a request for an apology or pressured to apologize as part of a settlement (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,367.38,579.48,63.84,7.91" target="#b44">Schneider, 2000)</ref>. Second, the presence of attorneys may have important effects on the giving and receiving of apologies in this context (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,432.05,602.08,69.35,7.91" target="#b38">Robbennolt, 2008)</ref>. Of particular interest here is that a growing number of attorneys would consider offering an apology on behalf of a client in the context of settlement negotiations (see J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,445.59,635.97,50.85,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,499.44,635.97,42.57,7.91" target="#b27">Levi, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, self-presentational concerns may be particularly salient in the legal context as the possibility of litigation looms. Because apologies can function as a tool of impression management (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,363.45,681.15,115.33,7.91" target="#b43">Schlenker &amp; Weigold, 1992)</ref>, decision-maker perceptions of the motives underlying the apology may influence their responses to the apology (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,464.86,703.74,81.19,7.91;1,306.00,715.04,46.03,7.91" target="#b2">Banerjee, Bennett, &amp; Luke, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,355.39,715.04,96.21,7.91">Darby &amp; Schlenker, 1989</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negotiated Apologies</head><p>Given plaintiffs' desire for apology (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,228.93,95.12,59.12,7.91;2,48.00,106.20,20.50,7.91" target="#b16">Gallagher et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.87,106.20,132.72,7.91" target="#b48">Vincent, Young, &amp; Phillips, 1994)</ref> and the hesitance of many defendants to offer apologies (see J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,219.53,117.28,49.38,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,272.05,117.28,11.99,7.91;2,48.00,128.36,68.44,7.91" target="#b16">Gallagher et al., 2003)</ref>, it is not surprising that plaintiff demands for apologies occur in the context of settlement negotiations in civil cases. Plaintiffs may specifically request an apology from the defendant as a precondition to engaging in settlement discussions (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.96,172.68,50.72,7.91" target="#b19">Henry, 2004)</ref> or as a condition or element of the settlement itself (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,146.13,183.76,51.03,7.91" target="#b0">Babula, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.95,183.76,47.53,7.91" target="#b28">Lewis, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.27,183.76,33.77,7.91;2,48.00,194.84,40.88,7.91">"Tire Victim," 2001)</ref>. Even when the other terms of settlement have been agreed, an unfulfilled demand for an apology can be a barrier to finalizing an agreement (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,155.51,216.98,91.15,7.91" target="#b11">Dooley &amp; Blaney, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.80,216.98,38.24,7.91;2,48.00,228.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b44">Schneider, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>For a variety of reasons, it is likely that many of these demands for apology will come in the context of mediation (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,246.48,250.18,41.55,7.91" target="#b27">Levi, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,261.25,60.43,7.91" target="#b44">Schneider, 2000)</ref>. And the mediation context-in which a neutral third party assists disputants to reach an accord, but generally has no authority to impose an agreement-may be particularly suited to apologies. First, apology is consistent with the philosophy behind mediation, which focuses on assisting the parties in resolving their disputes and attends to the interpersonal aspects of the dispute (J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,98.18,327.66,48.64,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.21,327.66,47.52,7.91" target="#b35">Riskin, 1982)</ref>. Second, mediation may be a particularly "safe" place in which a defendant can apologize. In addition to evidentiary rules that prohibit admission of statements made in settlement negotiations (see, e.g., Federal Rule Evidence 408, 2011), many states also specifically protect statements made in mediation (see, e.g., Uniform Mediation Act, 2003).</p><p>Consequently, apologies commonly occur in mediation (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,416.20,54.07,7.91">Umbreit, 1994)</ref>, and it is increasingly likely that during the course of settlement negotiations, an apology will be "encouraged" by a mediator (or by a judge presiding over a settlement conference) who suggests to a defendant that an apology is in order or would break an impasse (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,130.71,460.48,41.93,7.91" target="#b27">Levi, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,175.33,460.48,60.30,7.91" target="#b44">Schneider, 2000)</ref>. When this is done in the presence of the plaintiff or with the plaintiff's awareness, this may be another form of negotiated or requested apology.</p><p>How these negotiated apologies are perceived has been a subject of some controversy but little empirical examination. Some have argued that negotiated apologies, whether they are negotiated by the parties themselves or encouraged by a third party, seem less than ideal, potentially lacking in sincerity (see J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,239.10,537.95,48.96,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,549.02,56.93,7.91" target="#b45">Shuman, 2000)</ref> and more apt to be perceived as motivated by "self-serving" concerns (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,153.94,560.09,57.61,7.91" target="#b47">Tavuchis, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, there is something compelling about compelled apologies. Even spontaneous and voluntary apologies may be insincere or offered for self-serving reasons (see generally <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,604.36,132.15,7.91" target="#b22">Keltner, Young, &amp; Buswell, 1997)</ref>. And negotiated (and even coerced) apologies, although perhaps not ideal, may still ease negative emotions, affirm community standards, require the offender to articulate those standards, express the proper moral relation of the parties, signal that the injured person is a valued member of the community and should be treated as such, and smooth the way toward settlement (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,196.90,670.77,43.57,7.91" target="#b25">Latif, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.79,670.77,44.25,7.91;2,48.00,681.84,96.87,7.91" target="#b39">Robbennolt, Darley, &amp; MacCoun, 2003</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" coords="2,183.94,681.84,49.10,7.91" target="#b26">Lazare, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Some claimants find negotiated apologies to be sincere or see them as otherwise valuable components of their settlement agreements <ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.70,715.05,94.35,7.91" target="#b11">(Dooley &amp; Blaney, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.25,715.05,76.01,7.91">"Tire Victim," 2001)</ref>. Some are less concerned with sincerity, but nonetheless see other significance in demanded apologies. To take just one example, consider Michael Dasrath, an Indian American who worked for J. P. Morgan. Dasrath was removed from an airline flight in 2001 and requested an apology, refusing to settle his case without one: I know for a fact it won't be sincere at this point. I just want them to acknowledge what they did was wrong. They may not believe it, but at least I could say I have it in writing that <ref type="bibr" coords="2,464.00,160.66,19.10,7.03">[they]</ref> admitted that what [they] did was wrong. (B. T. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.07,170.79,38.61,7.03" target="#b50">White, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.60,170.79,14.93,7.03">White, , p. 1272</ref> In an early study, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,379.22,189.27,166.82,7.91" target="#b49">Weiner, Graham, Peter, and Zmuidinas (1991)</ref> examined responses to "confessions" that included admission of wrongdoing and an apology. Confessions were either given spontaneously or in response to an accusation of wrongdoing (cheating on a test or misusing an expense account). Weiner and colleagues found that both the spontaneous confessor and the accused confessor were perceived as more trustworthy, moral, honest, and sincere than were actors who denied responsibility. Similarly, both spontaneous and accused confessors elicited more sympathy and forgiveness and less anger and desire to punish than did actors who denied responsibility for the wrongdoing. These effects, however, were larger for the spontaneous confessor than for the accused confessor. In addition, the accused confessor was perceived to be more strongly motivated by impression management than either the spontaneous confessor or the denier.</p><p>Although offering some initial insight into the effects of negotiated apologies, the apologies in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,431.70,367.42,114.34,7.91">Weiner and colleagues' (1991)</ref> study differ in important ways from the type of negotiated apologies at issue here. In particular, the spontaneous confessor not only apologized but also owned up to behavior that might otherwise not have been detected. Thus, some of the effects-particularly those involving assessments of morality and honesty-might have been driven by the confession or admission itself rather than the apology. In addition, apologies were offered in response to an accusation of injury and wrongdoing rather than in response to a request for apology in a situation in which the injury and wrongdoing are clearer.</p><p>In a closer parallel, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,392.71,489.79,100.61,7.91" target="#b34">Risen and Gilovich (2007)</ref> examined requests for apology, distinguishing between the reactions of recipients and observers of apologies in their examination of spontaneous apologies as compared with apologies offered at the urging of a third party. They found that whereas observers distinguished between actors who apologized spontaneously and those who did so in response to a demand-evidencing more liking of, less desire to punish, and greater willingness to work with a spontaneous apologizer-apology recipients evaluated spontaneous and demanded apologies similarly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Delegated Apologies</head><p>Another complication that may arise when apologies are contemplated in the legal arena relates to who has the standing, or moral authority, to apologize (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,430.07,659.42,102.23,7.91" target="#b6">Brown &amp; Robbennolt, 2006)</ref>. In the context of civil litigation, this concern is most likely to arise when the defendant's attorney offers an apology to the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant <ref type="bibr" coords="2,390.85,692.79,50.33,7.91" target="#b19">(Henry, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,443.27,692.79,98.89,7.91">"Rogers Also Fined," 2005)</ref>. For example, in one prominent incident involving an altercation between baseball player Kenny Rogers and a cameraman ("Rogers Also Fined," 2005), Rogers' attorney offered the following statement:</p><p>Kenny Rogers would like to make a statement. However, in light of the ongoing investigation, it is not advisable for Kenny to comment directly and publicly at this time.</p><p>On Kenny's behalf, though, we would like to express to Mr. Rodriguez, Ranger fans, all baseball fans and his teammates that Kenny is truly sorry for the incident that occurred and regrets that it happened.</p><p>Attorneys concerned about the admissibility of apologetic statements may be more comfortable communicating any apology themselves, particularly if they prefer a very precisely worded statement (J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,106.20,215.54,47.36,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen, 1999)</ref>. The offender may also find it easier to have another speak on his behalf (see generally <ref type="bibr" coords="3,249.79,226.54,38.24,7.91;3,48.00,237.54,19.37,7.91" target="#b12">Eisenberg, 1976)</ref>. Such apologies might occur during bilateral settlement negotiations, in lawyers' opening statements in mediation, or in public fora.</p><p>Apologies, however, are, at their core, "dyadic"-tied to the relationship between the wrongdoer and the injured: "As the offender, for example, I cannot have someone apologize on my behalf any more than I, as the offended, can forgive by proxy or have another bestow this gift without my knowledge or consent" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,325.54,86.26,7.91">(Tavuchis, 1991, p. 49)</ref>. Even a company-the Tianjin Apology and Gift Center-that makes apologies on behalf of clients admits, "Of course it is more sincere if you apologize by yourself" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,358.54,63.35,7.91" target="#b42">(Rosenthal, 2001)</ref>. Therefore, many are skeptical that such apologies by proxy can be effective <ref type="bibr" coords="3,166.02,369.54,45.75,7.91" target="#b27">(Levi, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,215.28,369.54,52.26,7.91" target="#b31">Minow, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,271.04,369.54,12.74,7.91;3,48.00,380.54,44.90,7.91" target="#b47">Tavuchis, 1991)</ref>. Indeed, the week after the apology given by his attorneys, Kenny Rogers felt obliged (against the advice of counsel) to personally offer an apology ("Rogers Apologizes," 2005).</p><p>Here again, however, as with negotiated apologies, there may be some value even in delegated apologies. First, even if the apology itself is delegated to the defendant's attorney, the offender must still approve it (J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,126.27,446.54,47.87,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen, 1999)</ref>. In addition, although the best apologies have meaning that goes beyond mere ritual, sometimes "we will settle simply for the ritual-so long as it is not transparently insincere" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,108.48,479.54,80.91,7.91">(Murphy, 1988, p. 28)</ref>.</p><p>Data from a small study of 19 medical malpractice cases that were mediated are consistent with these intuitions <ref type="bibr" coords="3,246.87,501.54,41.19,7.91;3,48.00,512.54,59.52,7.91" target="#b21">(Hyman &amp; Schechter, 2006)</ref>. Ninety-one percent (10 of 11 cases) of the cases in which defense counsel offered an apology settled as compared with only 38% (three of eight cases) of cases in which no apology was offered. These cases differed in more ways than the presence or absence of an apology: Each involved the same defense attorney who chose whether or not to apologize, and no other information about the nature of the settlements was given. Nonetheless, these results are at least consistent with the notion that apologies may help to settle cases even when they are proffered by the defendant's attorney (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.45,611.53,69.34,7.91">Mazor et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Given the paucity of research examining negotiated and delegated apologies, particularly in the legal context, this study was designed to further explore perceptions of these sorts of apologies in the context of attempts to settle a civil lawsuit.</p></div>

Respondents were told that they would negotiate with the offender about a possible settlement and were asked to indicate their aspiration price ("What is the MOST amount of money you would hope to get in an out-of-court settlement?"), their reservation price ("What would be the LEAST amount of money you would accept to settle the case out-of-court-that is, your 'bottom line'?"), and their assessment of what a "fair" settlement would be ("What do you think would be a FAIR settlement in this case?"). In addition, respondents were asked to indicate their assessment of the sufficiency of the apology; their assessments of the nature of the injuries, the other party's conduct and character, and each party's responsibility for causing the incident; the degree to which they were angry at, sympathetic to, willing to forgive, and desired to punish the other party; and their assessments of how the incident would likely affect the relationship and the other party's conduct in the future (7-point scales). Participants were also asked about the motives they ascribed to the other party (5-point scales), completed a seven-item litigation attitudes scale <ref type="bibr" coords="3,442.90,275.04,85.09,7.91" target="#b18">(Hans &amp; Lofquist, 1994</ref>; see <ref type="table" coords="3,306.00,286.04,26.74,7.91" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>), and provided demographic information.</p><p>Both the compulsion behind the apology and the standing of the person offering the apology were systematically manipulated. Control participants evaluated a version of the scenario in which no apology was offered. This version was compared with four variants in which a responsibility-accepting apology was offered (i.e., "I want to let you know how sorry I am. The accident was my fault. I was going too fast and not watching where I was going until it was too late. I am so sorry"). This apology was offered either at the offender's own instigation ("Pat contacted you and said . . ."), in response to a request from the injured party ("[Y]ou got in touch with Pat and told her that you thought she owed you an apology. She then said . . ."), at the suggestion of a mediator ("The mediator suggested to Pat that it might help if she apologized to you. Pat then said . . ."), or by the offender's attorney ("Pat's attorney contacted you and said, 'Pat wants to let you know . . .'"). Participants were randomly assigned to one of these five experimental conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptions</head><p>Participants were asked a series of questions about their perceptions of the situation and the opposing party. Based on previous work with similar questions, two scales were constructed from these measures.</p><p>The first scale (␣ ϭ .90) represented participants' overall assessment of the apology and the information it conveyed, and included participants' ratings of the sufficiency of the apology, the degree to which the offender thought she was responsible, the offender's regret, the degree to which the offender would be careful in the future, the degree to which the offender respected the participant, and the offender's morality. Respondents differentially assessed the apologies and the meaning they conveyed as measured by this scale (see <ref type="table" coords="3,414.64,671.04,27.68,7.91" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>). Failure to apologize was viewed less positively than a spontaneous apology <ref type="formula" coords="3,498.52,682.04,3.75,7.91">(</ref> The second scale (␣ ϭ .67) represented participants' response to the incident, and included participants' ratings of their anger, their sympathy for the offender, the degree to which they thought the offender was responsible for their injuries, their willingness to forgive the offender, and the degree to which they thought the offender should be punished. These emotional and intended responses to the incident differed by apology (see <ref type="table" coords="4,239.04,421.04,28.12,7.91" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>). As compared with wrongdoers who failed to offer an apology, a significantly more favorable response was elicited by wrongdoers who apologized in response to a suggestion by a mediator (d ϭ Ϫ0.76, 95% CI [Ϫ1.00, Ϫ0.51]) and marginally more favorably responses were elicited by wrongdoers who apologized on their own (d ϭ Ϫ0.62, 95% CI [Ϫ0.86, Ϫ0.37]) or in response to a request by the injured party (d ϭ Ϫ0.73, 95% CI [Ϫ0.95, Ϫ0.51)].</p><p>Participants' assessments of the offender's apology acted as a mediator of the effect of the apology on their responses. When assessments of the apology were added as covariates, the effect of apology condition on participants' evaluations of their responses became nonsignificant, F(4, 131) ϭ 0.841, p ϭ .502, whereas assessment of the apology remained a significant predictor, F(1, 131) ϭ 33.442, p Ͻ .001, p 2 ϭ .203. There were no effects of apology on respondents' assessments of their own responsibility, F(4, 139) ϭ 0.395, p ϭ .812, the severity of their injuries, F(4, 138) ϭ 0.295, p ϭ .881, or their likelihood of winning the case at trial, F(4, 139) ϭ 1.148, p ϭ .337.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Settlement Levers</head><p>Participants also provided their assessment of various settlement levers-their reservation price (or bottom line), their aspirations, and their perception of a fair settlement value for the case. Because the settlement levers data were positively skewed, all analysis of means and correlations was performed on transformed data. 1</p><p>The different apology conditions did not produce a straightforward main effect on participants' settlement levers (ps Ͼ .05). Even so, respondents' apology-related perceptions were related to their settlement levers. As shown in the top of <ref type="table" coords="4,496.33,289.04,28.60,7.91" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, and consistent with bargaining theory, the greater the likelihood the respondents thought they had of winning the case in court, the higher the value of their settlement levers. In addition, however, settlement levers were significantly correlated with participants' assessments of the apology and their responses to it. The more favorably participants assessed the apology or their response to it, the lower were their settlement levers.</p><p>To minimize the number of separate tests conducted, participants' settlement levers were combined into a single measurement of settlement posture (␣ ϭ .87). As shown in <ref type="table" coords="4,469.48,399.04,26.03,7.91" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>, participants' assessments of the apology, ␤ ϭ Ϫ.389, t ϭ Ϫ3.008, p ϭ .003, and their evaluation of their responses to it, ␤ ϭ Ϫ.428, t ϭ Ϫ4.606, p Ͻ .001, both significantly influenced settlement posture. In addition, participants' evaluation of their responses to the offender's apology acted as a mediator of the effect of their assessments of the apology on their settlement posture. When evaluations were added as a covariate, the effect of the assessment of the apology on settlement posture became nonsignificant, whereas responses remained a significant predictor (Model 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sincerity and Motives</head><p>For those conditions in which there was an apology, respondents (n ϭ 118) were also asked to assess the sincerity of the apology and to judge the strength of each of five different motives that the wrongdoer might have had for apologizing.</p><p>Apologies offered by attorneys were perceived to be less credible than apologies offered by the offender spontaneously <ref type="formula" coords="4,527.32,591.54,3.74,7.91">(</ref>  <ref type="table" coords="4,443.69,624.54,26.74,7.91" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Perceived motives were subjected to a principal components factor analysis.

The second factor did not result in a reliable scale; the two items loading on that factor (desire to avoid a lawsuit and desire to avoid a guilty conscience) were analyzed separately. As shown in <ref type="table" coords="5,107.95,320.04,27.35,7.91" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>, wrongdoers whose attorney offered the apology on their behalf were perceived to be more motivated by a desire to avoid a lawsuit than were wrongdoers who personally offered the apology at their own instigation (d ϭ 0.85, 95% CI [0.61, 1.09]) or in response to a request for an apology from the injured party (d ϭ 1.20, 95% CI [0.96, 1.44]). In addition, wrongdoers whose attorney offered an apology on their behalf were perceived to have been less motivated by a focus on the other than those who offered the apology spontaneously (at levels approaching traditional standards of statistical significance; d ϭ Ϫ0.66, 95% CI [Ϫ0.87, Ϫ0.45]).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Consistent with past research, the responsibility-accepting apologies studied here had a positive influence on attributions about the situation and the offender. Respondents believed that offenders who personally offered full apologies accepted more responsibility and experienced more regret, would be more careful in the future, were more moral, and displayed more respect for the injured party. Participants also responded to such offenders more positively, experiencing less anger and desire to punish and more sympathy and willingness to forgive. In turn, these more positive perceptions and anticipated reactions were associated with lower settlement levers.</p><p>Importantly, respondents did not seem to devalue negotiated apologies-either those requested by the injured party or those offered at the suggestion of a mediator. Both types of negotiated apologies resulted in perceptions of and responses to the situation and the offender that were better than those of an offender who offered no apology and similar to the perceptions that respondents had following a spontaneous apology. These results highlight the potential value of negotiated apologies and suggest that there is merit in the theory that mediation can be a useful place for offering apologies.</p><p>It may be that because even a negotiated apology is ultimately offered by the offender, recipients make a dispositional attribution-presuming that an actor who apologizes is actually sorryand pay relatively less attention to the circumstances that gave rise to the act of apology, a reaction that is consistent with the fundamental attribution error (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,152.01,561.04,89.28,7.91" target="#b34">Risen &amp; Gilovich, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,243.80,561.04,44.25,7.91;6,48.00,572.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b36">Robbennolt, 2003)</ref>. Indeed, respondents in this study found spontaneous and negotiated apologies to be equally sincere. So, too, may recipients desire to believe that an offender is truly sorry and follow a social script that dictates that apologies be accepted <ref type="bibr" coords="6,222.72,605.04,60.34,7.91;6,48.00,616.04,44.73,7.91" target="#b3">(Bennett &amp; Dewberry, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,95.73,616.04,89.61,7.91" target="#b34">Risen &amp; Gilovich, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>That even negotiated apologies may be valued by litigants also provides indirect support for the value of apologies offered postsettlement. Negotiation scholars have long argued for the utility of "postsettlement settlements" in which an agreed-on settlement can be replaced by a revised agreement if both parties agree (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,48.00,682.04,47.46,7.91">Raiffa, 1995)</ref>. Secure in the knowledge that a default agreement has been reached, the parties can disclose additional information and explore solutions that might make at least one (and maybe both) side better off without harming the other. J. R. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,238.28,715.03,49.75,7.91" target="#b8">Cohen (1999)</ref> similarly raises the possibility of postsettlement apologies given after a release of liability. Such apologies are less legally risky for defendants, but may still be valuable to injured parties. If negotiated apologies are not devalued by their recipients, such postsettlement apologies may have a role to play in the satisfactory settlement of some disputes.</p><p>For apologies offered via an attorney or others who might offer apologies by proxy, the story is more complex. Although respondents did view an apology offered by the attorney as better than no apology at all, respondents did not view apologies-even full, responsibility-accepting apologies-offered by the offender's attorney as positively as apologies personally offered by the offender. Apologies offered by attorneys were also viewed as less sincere and were more likely to be perceived as being motivated by a desire to avoid a lawsuit than were the same apologies offered personally by the wrongdoer. It seems likely that apology recipients are less prone to make positive dispositional attributions about the wrongdoer when he or she does not personally offer the apology. They may question why the wrongdoer did not personally offer the apology, and be less compelled to follow an apology script from which the wrongdoer has already departed.</p><p>Finally, this study builds on work by <ref type="bibr" coords="6,460.82,308.03,85.20,7.91;6,306.00,319.03,23.99,7.91">Weiner and colleagues (1991)</ref> in exploring a mechanism for how apologies influence settlement that has not been as focal in previous research-the motives that are attributed to the apologizer. In this study, the motives attributed to an actor who apologizes for having caused harm were influenced by the circumstances of the proffered apology. In particular, apologies offered by attorneys were seen as more strongly influenced by a desire to avoid a lawsuit and less strongly driven by other-focused motives. In addition, those who were more skeptical about the civil justice system were-perhaps not surprisingly-inclined to be more cynical about the motives underlying apologies offered in the context of a civil lawsuit. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,306.00,440.03,141.12,7.91" target="#b13">Exline, DeShea, and Holeman (2007)</ref> have found that the most common attribution given for one's own apologies is a desire to help the other person or the relationship. In this legal settlement context, however, the desire to avoid a lawsuit was thought to be a primary motive for another's apology.</p><p>Motive attributions, in turn, influenced other perceptions of the wrongdoer and the situation and participants' approach to settlement. In particular, when the apology was seen as more strongly motivated by the desire to avoid a lawsuit, the apology was seen as less sincere and participants made less positive assessments of the offender's felt responsibility, regret, future conduct, and respect. In contrast, when the apology was seen as motivated by a focus on the injured party, the apology was seen as more sincere and participants made more positive assessments. In addition, the less otherfocused the apology was perceived to be, the greater the value of the settlement levers set by participants. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,315.00,616.02,110.32,7.91">Weiner and colleagues (1991)</ref> found that an accused confessor was perceived to be more motivated by impression management than was a spontaneous confessor or one who denied responsibility. In contrast, the study reported here found no differences in the motives attributed to spontaneous and negotiated apologizers. Importantly, however, the context of the apologies offered in these studies differed in important ways. First, in the study reported here, the injury to the victim and the nature of the wrongdoing were fairly transparent.

Second, as noted above, the requests for apology considered here differed from the sorts of accusations studied by Weiner and colleagues. And, finally, the conduct at issue here-negligent bicycling-differed from the fraudulent behaviors examined by Weiner and colleagues. Research has shown that the type of behavior at issue-in particular, whether the breach implicates the actor's competence or integrity-influences reactions to apologies <ref type="bibr" coords="7,119.93,166.22,145.54,7.91" target="#b23">(Kim, Dirks, Cooper, &amp; Ferrin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,269.78,166.22,18.25,7.91;7,48.00,177.37,113.59,7.91" target="#b24">Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, &amp; Dirks, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>This study provides new insight into how apologies operate in the context of legal negotiation, but there are many questions remaining. Experimental data such as those presented here offer a window into the types of settlement decisions that are difficult to observe in the field and provide a way in which to isolate the impact of an apology. Of course, in interpreting these results, it is important to bear in mind the limitations inherent in such simulated decision making. In addition, although this study had acceptable levels of power for detecting moderate to large differences, it was less likely to be able to detect small to moderate effects (see J. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,56.38,336.14,47.75,7.91" target="#b7">Cohen, 1988)</ref>. Although this study found no evidence of differences between apologies offered spontaneously, at the instigation of a mediator, or at the request of the injured party, future research ought to explore the possibility of more subtle effects.</p><p>In addition, the apologies examined here-full, responsibilityaccepting apologies-may have signaled a level of sincerity that surmounted any skepticism that might have been associated with the fact that the apology was not offered spontaneously. It may be, however, that less complete apologies that are offered during the course of settlement negotiation or by an attorney will have different effects. Thus, future research ought to explore the interactions among the context and source of the apology and its content.</p><p>Another avenue for research in this area would be to explore the effects of negotiated and delegated apologies on the apologizer. Because the giving and receiving of apologies is a dynamic and interactive process involving at least two parties, it is important to consider how requests for apologies or the delegation of an apology to an attorney affects the perspective of the apologizer and his or her interactions with the injured party. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,199.58,536.79,88.45,7.91;7,48.00,547.94,23.99,7.91" target="#b20">Hodgins and Liebeskind (2003)</ref> have, for example, found that a harsh reproach by the injured party can lead to more defensiveness on the part of the wrongdoer, can cause the wrongdoer to be more pessimistic about any future relationship between the parties, and can result in the wrongdoer offering less complex apologies. If the effects of negotiating for an apology are similar, then some types of requests for apology may result in less satisfactory apologies, which are responded to more negatively by plaintiffs. Thus, attention should be paid to how requests for apologies are made in negotiation, the effects of different kinds of requests on apologizers, and the resulting effects on injured parties.</p><p>Finally, future work might explore the importance to the injured party of exercising her own agency in demanding or negotiating the apology (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,108.68,692.76,54.18,7.91" target="#b1">Bandura, 2001)</ref>. Plaintiffs may benefit from being self-efficacious in eliciting apologies from offenders, or may find comparable merit in having another person or group demand or negotiate apologies on their behalf (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,453.03,77.03,88.52,7.91;7,306.00,88.07,59.23,7.91" target="#b4">Bolivar, Aertsen, &amp; Vanfraechem, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,368.22,88.07,69.34,7.91">Mazor et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,441.43,86.64,3.50,4.83">2</ref> Decisions about whether and how to apologize and how to respond to apologies in the context of potential civil liability are complex.
