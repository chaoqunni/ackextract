<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Constructive deviance is a voluntary behavior that violates organizational rules but is conducted with honorable intentions to benefit the organization or its stakeholders. Despite emerging interest in this behavior, the antecedents of constructive deviance remain unclear, with particular ambiguity concerning the relationship between organizational identity and constructive deviance.</p><p>In this article, we address this ambiguity with the normative conflict model, which posits that organizational identity drives constructive deviance in the workplace only when people perceive normative conflict with organizational rules. In Studies 1a and 1b, we develop and validate a measure of normative conflict. In Study 2, we conduct a preliminary test of the model with employed students and find that identity is positively related to constructive deviance only when normative conflict is high. In Study 3, we replicate and extend the model to show that the moderating effect of normative conflict is mediated by experienced psychological discomfort and that organizational identity is positively related to constructive deviance among working adults only when discomfort is high. In total, our findings demonstrate the utility of the normative conflict model for explaining when constructive deviance is mostly likely to occur in the workplace.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To clarify the relationship between organizational identity and constructive deviance, we draw on a recent theory of group dissent called the normative conflict model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.74,76.25,51.91,7.18" target="#b41">(Packer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,236.98,76.25,47.99,7.18" target="#b42">Packer, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>This model explains that the effects of organizational identity on deviance depend on the extent to which group members perceive normative conflict, which occurs when members perceive a discrepancy between the group's actual, practiced norms and some better, alternative standard for behavior. The model posits that identity predicts conformity when normative conflict is low but that identity predicts dissent instead when normative conflict is high.</p><p>This interaction occurs because strongly identified group members who feel normative conflict exhibit dissent intended to help the group improve. Consequently, the model may offer insight into constructive deviance: We predict that organizational identity is only predictive of constructive deviance when people also feel high normative conflict.</p><p>Our research on the normative conflict model makes several contributions. First and foremost, we advance research on constructive deviance by resolving an emergent discrepancy in the literature concerning its relationship with social identity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.56,297.29,71.41,7.18" target="#b69">(Vadera et al., 2013)</ref>. This is an important theoretical contribution because we know little about why constructive deviance occurs, and the contradictory findings concerning the relationship between organizational identity and constructive deviance points to a need to understand the boundary conditions that change the nature of this relationship <ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.30,362.26,24.39,7.18;2,45.64,375.24,79.69,7.18" target="#b6">(Busse, Kach, &amp; Wagner, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we introduce the normative conflict model to the organizational behavior literature, which is a promising framework for understanding identity-driven behavior in the workplace. Research on the normative conflict model to date is focused on informal or opinion-based social groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.99,440.27,90.91,7.18" target="#b44">Packer &amp; Chasteen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,256.25,440.27,32.42,7.18;2,45.64,453.25,64.36,7.18" target="#b63">TÃ¤uber &amp; Sassenberg, 2012)</ref>, but we show that the model has utility for predicting behavior in the workplace, where the stakes for engaging in deviant behavior are higher. Managers in the workplace heavily weigh deviant behavior when judging performance and making personnel decisions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,117.87,505.23,93.27,7.18" target="#b54">(Rotundo &amp; Sackett, 2002)</ref>, and employees may face sanctions or lose their jobs for deviating in ways that are suppressed by the organization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.50,531.26,107.92,7.18" target="#b3">(Berry, Ones, &amp; Sackett, 2007)</ref>. The steeper consequences of constructive deviance at work accordingly allow for a strong test of the theory in a formal setting where rules are more rigidly enforced and dissent is met with greater hostility (X. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,57.09,583.24,40.68,7.18" target="#b75">Zhou, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Last, we extend the normative conflict model in this research by elaborating on the psychological experience of normative conflict. One limitation of the normative conflict model is relatively little consideration of why normative conflict motivates action; implicit in the normative conflict model is the idea that normative conflict is a distressing experience <ref type="bibr" coords="2,179.77,661.25,50.66,7.18" target="#b41">(Packer, 2008)</ref>. Consequently, we integrate the normative conflict model with cognitive dissonance theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.01,687.27,58.18,7.18" target="#b17">(Festinger, 1957)</ref>, which offers additional insight into why people experience psychological distress in the presence of normative conflict and subsequently act on it. We therefore make an important theoretical extension to the normative conflict model to better explain why normative conflict can trigger deviant behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">| Constructive deviance in the workplace</head><p>When considering rule-breaking behavior, organizations mainly focus on destructive deviance, which is voluntary behavior that knowingly deviates from organizational norms in ways that threaten the organization or its stakeholders <ref type="bibr" coords="2,436.59,109.25,109.39,7.18" target="#b53">(Robinson &amp; Bennett, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Destructive deviance is threatening because it is committed with the intention to either harm others or benefit the self <ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.74,135.49,55.92,7.18;2,306.65,148.65,18.51,7.18" target="#b71">(Vardi &amp; Weitz, 2004)</ref>. For example, behaviors such as merchandise theft conducted in the interest of personal gain, or verbal aggression intended to hurt a coworker's feelings, would be categorized as instances of destructive deviance.</p><p>Constructive deviance similarly involves willful deviation from organizational norms, but the deviation is intended to benefit the organization or its stakeholders <ref type="bibr" coords="2,436.31,227.28,62.85,7.18" target="#b37">(Morrison, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,506.04,227.28,43.59,7.18;2,306.65,240.37,64.83,7.18" target="#b60">Spreitzer &amp; Sonenshein, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,374.17,240.37,49.30,7.18" target="#b73">Warren, 2003)</ref>. Because the standards for judging deviance can be highly subjective, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.35,253.53,53.36,7.18" target="#b73">Warren (2003)</ref> submitted that deviance is only constructive if employees reject organizational norms in favor of hypernorms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.00,279.78,97.24,7.18" target="#b11">(Donaldson &amp; Dunfee, 1994)</ref>, which are defined as "globally held beliefs and values" that encompass basic principles and satisfy fundamental human needs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.92,306.02,76.36,7.18">(Warren, 2003, p. 628)</ref>. Because hypernorms typically stem from the values and practices of large, inclusive social groups and societies, they serve as a "higher authority" that reflect the needs and priorities of people both inside and outside of the organization. Relevant hypernorms that are used to judge behavior may vary across different nations, industries, organizations, and even roles. However, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,396.74,384.77,50.87,7.18" target="#b73">Warren (2003)</ref> suggested that the standards and ethical codes of relevant, large, and inclusive organizations can serve as a likely source of hypernorms. For example, the American Psychological Association's Ethical Code and Code of Conduct articulate hypernorms about protecting the privacy of clients. A psychologist could opt to constructively deviate to follow these hypernorms if she felt that her organization or workgroup's norms failed to adequately protect the confidential information divulged by clients. Thus, deviance that rejects local norms and practices, but complies with hypernorms, is constructive because it serves a greater good.</p><p>Consequently, constructive deviance is formally defined as behavior that (a) benefits the reference group, (b) deviates from reference group norms, and (c) conforms to broader hypernorms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.65,568.45,71.18,7.18" target="#b69">(Vadera et al., 2013)</ref>. A specific example of the distinction between destructive and constructive deviance can be seen in a typical customer service context. If a regular customer of a restaurant presents an expired gift certificate, an employee can decide to follow procedure and refuse it, or break rules and accept it. The decision to break rules can occur due to different motivations. In this example, the rule-breaking behavior would be considered destructive deviance if the employee opts to accept the gift certificate because it benefits himself (e.g., through a larger tip) or because he hopes it will hurt the organization to lose money. On the other hand, the rule-breaking behavior would be considered constructive deviance if the employee opts to accept the gift certificate to help the customer and organization (e.g., this customer is important and would take his business elsewhere if refused, costing the organization more in the long run).</p><p>In the latter case, the employee is still willingly deviating from an organizational rule, but his choice is made with the express aim of helping the company and complying with broader societal hypernorms concerning kindness that should be shown to others.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" coords="3,57.26,89.29,70.26,7.18" target="#b69">Vadera et al. (2013)</ref> observed, many organizational behaviors can be constructively deviant under certain circumstances, such as whistleblowing <ref type="bibr" coords="3,102.10,115.25,85.35,7.18" target="#b57">(Sims &amp; Keenan, 1998)</ref> and expressing challenging voice <ref type="bibr" coords="3,68.09,128.29,69.52,7.18" target="#b5">(Burris et al., 2008)</ref>, provided that they are conducted with the intention to help the organization or its stakeholders and comply with a broader hypernorm instead.</p><p>Constructive deviance can have important consequences in workgroups and the overall organization. Fundamentally, constructive deviance is valuable because it provides the group with alternative norms that can serve as the catalyst for change <ref type="bibr" coords="3,221.44,206.24,67.17,7.18;3,45.64,219.28,20.38,7.18" target="#b30">(Jetten &amp; Hornsey, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,70.36,219.28,80.63,7.18" target="#b52">Prislin &amp; Filson, 2009)</ref>; challenging the existing norms that characterize the status quo can introduce much needed instability that unlocks the potential for positive, adaptive growth <ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.30,245.25,60.32,7.18;3,45.64,258.28,47.65,7.18" target="#b21">(Gioia, Schultz, &amp; Corley, 2000)</ref>. Consequently, constructive deviance may result in better performance and retention within groups <ref type="bibr" coords="3,216.00,271.27,68.97,7.18" target="#b69">(Vadera et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Constructive deviance is also associated with desirable individual states, such as role breadth self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" coords="3,193.10,297.29,54.85,7.18" target="#b20">(Galperin, 2012)</ref>. However, the consequences of constructive deviance are complex and likely dependent on organizational context. For example, constructive deviance that benefits one work group may cause complications for other, interdependent work groups <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.92,349.28,70.61,7.18" target="#b69">(Vadera et al., 2013)</ref>. Also, some instances of constructive deviance that are well intentioned can nevertheless lead to negative outcomes if rule breakers do not recognize the importance of violated norms <ref type="bibr" coords="3,201.09,388.28,87.53,7.18;3,45.64,401.26,51.28,7.18" target="#b9">(Dahling, Chau, Mayer, &amp; Gregory, 2012)</ref>. Although the outcomes of constructive deviance are consequently in need of further study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,193.78,414.24,94.88,7.18" target="#b30">(Jetten &amp; Hornsey, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,45.64,427.28,75.47,7.18" target="#b69">Vadera et al., 2013)</ref>, it is clear that constructive deviance can have powerful effects in organizational settings that warrant more research attention.</p><p>Several studies have identified antecedents of constructive deviance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,97.91,479.27,72.03,7.18" target="#b9">Dahling et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.86,479.27,54.29,7.18" target="#b20">Galperin, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,230.06,479.27,54.91,7.18" target="#b37">Morrison, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,45.64,492.25,67.93,7.18" target="#b69">Vadera et al. (2013)</ref> recently published the first comprehensive review of this literature, in which they organized the predictors of constructive deviance into three conceptual categories: intrinsic motivation, felt obligation, and psychological empowerment. They also highlighted several emergent contradictions in the literature that require clarification, most notably the effect that organizational identity has on constructive deviance. As we explain in the following section, identity can theoretically exhibit a positive or negative relationship with constructive deviance. For example, organizational identity is positively related to behaviors that benefit the organization, which could include constructive deviance <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.63,622.25,91.04,7.18;3,45.64,635.23,14.81,7.18" target="#b68">(Vadera, Aguilera, &amp; Caza, 2009</ref>). On the other hand, organizational identity is also positively related to adherence to organizational norms and values <ref type="bibr" coords="3,267.70,648.27,20.98,7.18;3,45.64,661.25,18.51,7.18" target="#b51">(Pratt, 2000)</ref>. Consistent with these contradictory arguments, the empirical literature on identity and constructive deviance is split: Some studies have found a positive relationship (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,183.74,687.27,69.03,7.18" target="#b35">Mellahi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,255.06,687.27,33.65,7.18;3,45.64,700.25,69.65,7.18" target="#b40">Olkkonen &amp; Lipponen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,120.08,700.25,82.67,7.18" target="#b64">Taylor &amp; Curtis, 2010)</ref>, others have found a negative relationship (e.g., J. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,147.57,713.24,77.68,7.18" target="#b76">Zhou &amp; George, 2001)</ref>, and others have found no relationship at all <ref type="bibr" coords="3,152.39,726.28,72.88,7.18" target="#b5">(Burris et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,229.78,726.28,58.90,7.18;3,45.64,739.26,18.51,7.18" target="#b57">Sims &amp; Keenan, 1998)</ref>. What might predict, then, when organizational identity will lead an employee to adhere to norms versus break them? The normative conflict model introduces a key moderator that sheds light on this relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">| The normative conflict model of group dissent</head><p>The normative conflict model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,410.29,115.31,49.64,7.18" target="#b41">(Packer, 2008)</ref> was developed to explain the interplay between group identity and the choice to either conform or dissent from group norms. The model builds on social identity theory (SIT; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,350.93,154.26,91.99,7.18" target="#b14">Ellemers &amp; Haslam, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,446.00,154.26,44.42,7.18" target="#b61">Tajfel, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,493.57,154.26,56.13,7.18;3,306.65,167.30,18.44,7.18" target="#b62">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979)</ref>, which states that strongly identified group members usually conform to the group's salient norms and standards (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,521.46,180.28,28.17,7.18;3,306.65,193.26,42.66,7.18" target="#b65">Terry &amp; Hogg, 1996)</ref>. However, strong identifiers sometimes behave differently when they perceive that their group is threatened in some way that challenges its status or value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,440.90,219.28,78.44,7.18" target="#b8">Crane &amp; Platow, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,521.29,219.28,28.39,7.18;3,306.65,232.27,108.77,7.18" target="#b10">Dahling, Wiley, Fishman, &amp; Loihle, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,417.26,232.27,113.64,7.18" target="#b15">Ellemers, Spears, &amp; Doosje, 2002)</ref>. The normative conflict model diverges from SIT by describing what happens when the group is specifically threatened from within by its own rules or norms that have become harmful, dangerous, or ineffective to the group <ref type="bibr" coords="3,369.98,284.25,48.56,7.18" target="#b41">(Packer, 2008)</ref>. According to the model, a sense of normative conflict occurs when group members perceive a discrepancy between the group's actual norms and some better, alternative standard for behavior. For example, normative conflict might occur for a tenured professor if her university takes advantage of adjunct faculty who could instead be treated better, for a cook if her restaurant discards food that could alternatively be donated to a homeless shelter, and for a sales associate if store rules prevent her from serving customers as effectively as a competing business does.</p><p>People need to perceive a discrepancy between the actual norms practiced by the group and alternative norms to experience normative conflict, but where do these better, alternative norms come from?</p><p>According to SIT, alternative norms arise from other aspects of personal or group identities that a person holds <ref type="bibr" coords="3,458.59,453.25,49.35,7.18" target="#b41">(Packer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,509.73,453.25,39.97,7.18;3,306.65,466.29,112.11,7.18" target="#b70">van Veelen, Otten, Cadinu, &amp; Hansen, 2016)</ref>. For example, alternative norms can be derived from personal or moral values (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,467.89,479.27,81.77,7.18;3,306.65,492.25,68.90,7.18" target="#b29">Hornsey, Majkut, Terry, &amp; McKimmie, 2003)</ref>, leading to normative conflict as in the previous example of a cook who objects to wasting food when it could instead be used to help people in need. Alternative norms can also arise from the practices of other groups, much like benchmarking, as in the example of the sales associate who perceives that a competing business's norms offer a preferable standard of customer service quality <ref type="bibr" coords="3,522.48,557.28,27.22,7.18;3,306.65,570.26,18.51,7.18" target="#b41">(Packer, 2008)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,364.76,570.26,51.32,7.18" target="#b73">Warren (2003)</ref> theorized that hypernorms are drawn from the values and practices of large, inclusive groups that reflect the values of many people. These groups might include humanitarian agencies, such as the World Health Organization, that seek to serve all people or smaller groups that specify the ethical practices of a particular profession, such as the Academy of Management. Thus, alternative norms can arise from a variety of personal and social sources, and the sources of the alternative norms that people perceive to be better than their actual norms will vary widely across contexts.</p><p>Regardless of the specific way in which normative conflict manifests, this discrepancy between the group's actual, practiced norms and alternative, better norms yields a sense of tension that people are motivated to resolve. To this end, the normative conflict model explains how the effect of group identification on behavior depends on normative conflict. When normative conflict is high, identity is positively related to "dissent," which Packer (2008) defined as "nonconformist reactions motivated by a desire to change group norms and initiate improvement within the group" (p. 54). However, identity is positively related to conformity to group norms when normative conflict is low because the norms are judged as appropriate and acceptable. The model also specifies that identity is negatively related to behavioral or psychological disengagement when normative conflict is high. That is, people with low levels of group identity respond to normative conflict by simply disengaging from the group <ref type="bibr" coords="4,147.63,154.26,50.83,7.18" target="#b41">(Packer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,201.71,154.26,43.21,7.18" target="#b42">Packer, 2011</ref>). An abundance of evidence from SIT supports this proposition, demonstrating that weak identifiers tend to respond to group threats by distancing themselves from the group, to the extent that they are able to do so <ref type="bibr" coords="4,45.64,206.24,73.17,7.18" target="#b15">(Ellemers et al., 2002)</ref>. Thus, dissent should only occur for high identifiers, but only when they also feel high normative conflict.</p><p>To date, empirical research on the normative conflict model has tested the model in informal or opinion-based social groups (e.g., online chat groups; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.01,258.28,87.90,7.18" target="#b44">Packer &amp; Chasteen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,178.24,258.28,93.52,7.18" target="#b63">TÃ¤uber &amp; Sassenberg, 2012)</ref>. For example, Packer and Chasteen conducted a set of studies testing the model in informal groups of college students.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">| Integrating cognitive dissonance theory</head><p>People experience normative conflict when they detect a discrepancy between existing organizational norms and some alternative, better norms. To extend the model, we believe that the reason that normative conflict strengthens the relationship between identity and constructive deviance is that normative conflict is a psychologically uncomfortable experience and that the urge to resolve this discomfort is what generates the motivation among high identifiers to engage in constructive deviance. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,127.28,700.27,48.94,7.18" target="#b41">Packer (2008)</ref> hinted at this idea, noting that people may be "bothered by" normative conflict in ways that motivate their actions (p. 65).</p><p>In this respect, we see a possible connection between the normative conflict model and cognitive dissonance theory, which clarifies that holding conflicting or inconsistent thoughts, such as abiding by actual norms that are less desirable than alternative norms, is psychologically uncomfortable. One way that people can reduce this tension is to change their behavior, such as by taking actions that reduce the discrepancy between those inconsistent thoughts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,508.02,102.27,41.61,7.18;4,306.65,115.25,55.31,7.18" target="#b18">Festinger &amp; Carlsmith, 1959)</ref>. Empirical research strongly supports this proposition and demonstrates that feelings of tension and discomfort mediate the effects of cognitive dissonance on behavioral intentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,523.90,141.27,25.73,7.18;4,306.65,154.26,49.13,7.18" target="#b16">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,357.96,154.26,116.63,7.18" target="#b22">Glasford, Pratto, &amp; Dovidio, 2008)</ref>.

When does identity prompt constructive deviance rather than conformity to rules? We demonstrated that the relationship between organizational identity and constructive deviance depends on normative conflict and, more specifically, on the experience of psychological discomfort that is triggered by normative conflict. Studies 1a and 1b developed and validated a reliable measure of normative conflict with a stable factor structure. Study 2 provided a preliminary test of the normative conflict model to predict constructive deviance among employed students, demonstrating that identity only promotes constructive deviance when normative conflict is high. We then elaborated on these results in Study 3, which advanced the normative conflict model with a mediator, psychological discomfort, consistent with cognitive dissonance theory <ref type="bibr" coords="11,513.58,726.29,36.04,7.18;11,306.65,739.27,18.51,7.18" target="#b17">(Festinger, 1957)</ref>.

We expect that the interaction of high identity and low normative conflict would yield a significant effect on a more direct measurement of organizational loyalty or rule conformity, which is an important issue to explore in future studies.</p><p>A second explanation for this null finding is a simple floor effect; as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="13,80.39,388.28,54.01,7.18" target="#fig_2">Figures 2 and 3</ref>, our samples reported overall low levels of constructive deviance, perhaps yielding an insufficient range for a negative relationship between identity and constructive deviance to emerge when normative conflict was low. A related, third explanation stems from the normative conflict model, which explains that high identifiers with low normative conflict may still engage in occasional instances of "strategic nonconformity" <ref type="bibr" coords="13,194.57,466.29,94.09,7.18;13,45.64,479.27,22.73,7.18">(Packer &amp; Miners, 2014, p. 359)</ref>. Strategic nonconformity involves dissenting from a norm that one actually endorses for the good of the group, such as by playing "devil's advocate" to build consensus and ensure that the group is making good decisions <ref type="bibr" coords="13,127.33,518.27,48.22,7.18" target="#b42">(Packer, 2011)</ref>. Given the overall low levels of constructive deviance that we observed in our data, even very occasional strategic nonconformity might explain why we did not find a negative relationship between identity and constructive deviance when normative conflict was low.</p><p>Researchers may also gain additional insight into the normative conflict model by differentiating between self-focused versus groupfocused normative conflict <ref type="bibr" coords="13,138.50,609.26,90.57,7.18" target="#b44">(Packer &amp; Chasteen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,230.63,609.26,58.00,7.18;13,45.64,622.25,18.51,7.18" target="#b46">Packer &amp; Miners, 2014)</ref>. Self-focused normative conflict occurs when problematic rules affect only the individual employee, whereas group-focused normative conflict occurs when problematic rules affect the group. Our measure was written to reference group-focused normative conflict, but it is likely that strong identifiers are not as willing to dissent when they perceive only self-focused normative conflict. By clarifying the focus of the normative conflict that people experience, future research may further explain when employees are likely to take different kinds of action to resolve their feelings of psychological discomfort.</p><p>Goal construal also has important effects within the normative conflict model that offer promising directions for future research.</p><p>Packer and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="13,392.60,50.27,52.24,7.18" target="#b43">(Packer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,449.46,50.27,100.16,7.18;13,306.65,63.25,20.38,7.18" target="#b45">Packer, Fujita, &amp; Chasteen, 2014)</ref> have recently demonstrated that the relationship between group identity and dissent depends on participants' level of goal construal. When people consider goals at a high level of construal, they think in abstract, distal terms and are more open to the possibility of group change. In contrast, when people consider goals at a low level of construal, they think in concrete, immediate terms and prioritize group stability. Consequently, high identifiers are more likely to dissent when they adopt a high level of goal construal that makes the possibility of change and improvement salient . Future research could build on these findings in organizations by testing if constructive deviance is enhanced when high identifiers engage in activities such as strategic planning that encourage a high goal construal level.</p><p>Finally, future research should move beyond the study of antecedents to investigate the consequences of constructive deviance in organizations. Constructive deviance has the potential to yield a variety of desirable outcomes, such as enhanced efficiency <ref type="bibr" coords="13,477.47,258.27,72.20,7.18" target="#b9">(Dahling et al., 2012)</ref> and constructive organizational change <ref type="bibr" coords="13,445.55,271.26,64.09,7.18" target="#b19">(Fuller et al., 2006)</ref>. However, constructive deviance may yield unintended, negative consequences as well; rules sometimes exist for valid reasons that employees do not understand, and breaking those rules may cause broader problems despite good intentions <ref type="bibr" coords="13,394.18,323.24,73.39,7.18" target="#b69">(Vadera et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,470.89,323.24,75.09,7.18" target="#b71">Vardi &amp; Weitz, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Although the normative conflict model sheds light on the motives and intended outcomes behind acts of workplace deviance, more research is needed to examine under what conditions these behaviors yield the desired results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">| Limitations</head><p>Our research has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, our samples are restricted in some respects. Racial and ethnic minorities were underrepresented in both Studies 2 and 3 that tested the normative conflict model. With respect to work experience, entry-and midlevel employees were overrepresented in both samples. It is therefore unclear whether and how individuals with greater power and supervisory scope engage in constructive deviance. Future research should consequently replicate our findings with more diverse samples.</p><p>Second, the variables in our studies were all self-reported. We made this choice because all of our antecedent variables (identity, normative conflict, and psychological discomfort) are perceptual variables that only the focal respondent could rate. Concerning the criterion variables, we chose self-ratings because managers, coworkers, and other raters may be unable to distinguish between the motive structures underlying constructive versus destructive deviance <ref type="bibr" coords="13,306.65,622.25,74.53,7.18" target="#b9">(Dahling et al., 2012)</ref>. Fortunately, our focal hypotheses concerned interactions, which are not susceptible to CMV <ref type="bibr" coords="13,484.78,635.29,64.85,7.18;13,306.65,648.28,49.68,7.18" target="#b56">(Siemsen, Roth, &amp; Oliveira, 2010)</ref>, and our replication with a time-separated measure of constructive deviance in Study 3 also helps to allay concerns about CMV <ref type="bibr" coords="13,328.93,674.30,84.56,7.18" target="#b50">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. Nevertheless, our design would be stronger if an external observer could provide the deviance ratings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">| Conclusion</head><p>Constructive deviance may provide many benefits to organizations, such as improved organizational effectiveness and increased competitive advantage. Although research is increasingly focusing on this important criterion, conflicting findings exist concerning the relationship between organizational identity and constructive deviance. Our studies clarified this contradictory literature by applying the normative conflict model, designing a scale to measure normative conflict, and testing a mediated-moderation mechanism that explains how this experience motivates constructive deviance. We hope that our findings spark further applications of the normative conflict model to understand deviant behavior in organizations.</p><p>Copyright of Journal of Organizational Behavior is the property of John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

motivation is not constructive; Vadera et al., 2013). Most available

Consequently, it was important to demonstrate in this research that normative conflict and social identity can still motivate dissent despite the prospect of steeper consequences. Support for the normative conflict model in organizational settings bolsters the generalizability of the theory and suggests that this model has potential for predicting other organizational behaviors as well, a point that we explore below as a future research direction.Our work is also important to emerging theory concerning constructive deviance. Theory explaining the antecedents of constructive deviance is underdeveloped, and the empirical literature is presently characterized by a variety of contradictory findings<ref type="bibr" coords="12,306.65,154.25,70.78,7.18" target="#b69">(Vadera et al., 2013)</ref>. Our results clarify the ambiguities surrounding the relationship between social identity and constructive deviance by pointing to the critical moderating role of normative conflict perceptions. As we noted previously, the normative conflict model offers valuable precision for helping organizational researchers (a) understand when constructive deviance is likely to occur and (b) better differentiate constructive and destructive deviance.6.2 | Implications for practiceOur findings demonstrate that feelings of normative conflict can trigger constructive deviance among highly identified employees, which underscores that managers need to talk with employees about their understanding of rules and policies in the workplace. Managers who want to guide and control constructive deviance can do so by carefully explaining the reasoning behind organizational rules and accepting employee input concerning alternative practices that might be preferable. We expect that employees are unlikely to dissent with extreme acts of rule breaking if they can instead resolve their dissonance-based discomfort by openly expressing voice and enacting change collaboratively with their supervisors and peers</figDesc><table></table></figure>

In both Studies 2 and 3, identity had a null relationship with constructive deviance when normative conflict was low. In contrast, the normative conflict model generally posits that deviance should be lowered (or, conversely, that conformity should be increased) under these circumstances.
