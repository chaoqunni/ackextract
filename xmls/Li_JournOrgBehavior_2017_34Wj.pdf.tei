<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Drawing on gestalt characteristics theory, we advance the literature on the effect of job complexity on employee well-being by considering intra-individual variability of job complexity over time. Specifically, we examine how the trend, or trajectory, of job complexity over time can explain unique variance of employee job strain. Across two longitudinal data sets, we consistently find that, with the average level of job complexity during a given period held constant, a positive job complexity trajectory (i.e., an increasing trend in complexity) is associated with higher employee job strain. Based on job-demand-control theory and the exposurereactivity model, we further establish that job autonomy and employee emotional stability jointly moderate the relationship between job complexity trajectory and employee job strain. Specifically, for employees with high emotional stability, job autonomy mitigates the job strain brought by positive job complexity trajectory, whereas for employees with low emotional stability, job autonomy does not help to reduce the adverse effect of the increasing trend. These findings not only contribute to extend the understanding of the job complexitystrain relationship, but also suggest a promising, dynamic avenue to study the effects of work characteristics on employee well-being as well as other outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Over the past 40 years, a proliferation of research has sought to identify antecedents to employee work strain. It is widely recognized, moreover, that the design of work plays a substantial role in the process of job stress 1 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,491.87,412.85,30.12,8.80;1,62.02,424.81,64.47,8.80" target="#b23">(Griffin &amp; Clarke, 2011)</ref>. In particular, the effect of job complexity on employees' physical and psychological well-being has received much scholarly attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,254.89,436.83,77.24,8.80" target="#b12">Chung-Yan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,337.67,436.83,184.28,8.80" target="#b51">Schaubroeck, Ganster, &amp; Kemmerer, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,62.02,448.85,136.37,8.80" target="#b52">Schaubroeck, Jones, &amp; Xie, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,201.15,448.85,120.16,8.80" target="#b53">Schaubroeck &amp; Merritt, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,324.00,448.85,87.46,8.80" target="#b54">Shaw &amp; Gupta, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,414.15,448.85,76.77,8.80" target="#b65">Xie &amp; Johns, 1995)</ref>. Previous studies, using cross-sectional or predictive designs, established the relationship between job complexity and employee well-being as well as the important contingencies (e.g., proactive personality: Chung-Yan &amp; Butler, 2011) of the relationship. Along this stream of research, however, the impact of dynamic changes in job complexity on employee well-being has been largely ignored, even though researchers have been calling for studies to explore the implications of dynamics in work characteristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,297.87,508.83,84.67,8.80" target="#b22">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</ref>).</p><p>One of the promising avenues to explore such dynamics is the idea of trajectory <ref type="bibr" coords="1,394.30,520.85,123.37,8.80" target="#b41">(Mitchell, Burch, &amp; Lee, 2014)</ref>, which has its theoretical roots in gestalt characteristic theory.

The evaluation of a certain experience at a point in time is not limited to the end state or the average intensity of the transient *Correspondence to: Junchao Li, Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, U.S.A. E-mail: junchli@uw. edu experiences that constitute the profile. Instead, the dynamic property of the profile-that is, the trend of that experience over time-plays an important role in shaping individuals' expectations of the future and thereby the current experience. Recent organizational behavior studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,284.38,101.38,220.51,8.80" target="#b11">Chen, Ployhart, Thomas, Anderson, &amp; Bliese, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,44.96,113.40,170.05,8.80" target="#b27">Hausknecht, Sturman, &amp; Roberson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,218.44,113.40,183.72,8.80" target="#b34">Liu, Mitchell, Lee, Holtom, &amp; Hinkin, 2012)</ref> consistently showed that the trajectory, or trend, of an attitude/perception in a given period explains unique and significant variance in individual outcomes beyond the average level of that attitude/perception. The purpose of this paper is to extend the understanding of the relationship between job complexity and employee job strain with such a dynamic approach. Employees' perceptions of job complexity are likely to change over time. On one hand, the skills and knowledge needed at work may get routinized over time for some employees. As a result, they may gradually perceive decreasing job complexity. On the other hand, some employees may experience increasing job complexity over time when their work contents and tasks are restructured to a more sophisticated level or when they are assigned new tasks that require different knowledge and skills. Such task restructuring is especially likely when organizations/teams adopt new work procedures or new information systems in response to the competitive and dynamic market environment, or reallocate tasks because of company downsizing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.17,233.36,42.76,8.80;2,44.96,245.38,174.79,8.80" target="#b44">(Nikolova, Van Ruysseveldt, De Witte, &amp; Syroit, 2014)</ref>. In this paper, we study the intra-individual variability of job complexity over time and make the first attempt to explore whether the job complexity trajectory might exert unique influences on employees' well-being beyond the absolute (average) levels of job complexity.</p><p>Based on job-demand-control theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,205.63,281.38,64.44,8.80" target="#b32">(Karasek, 1979)</ref> and the exposure-reactivity model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,413.13,281.38,91.75,8.80;2,44.96,293.40,21.43,8.80" target="#b7">(Bolger &amp; Zuckerman, 1995)</ref>, we further explore the moderating effects of job autonomy and emotional stability on the relationship between job complexity trajectory and job strain. According to job-demand-control theory, employees' control in decisions over their job can help them better cope with job demands. Empirical studies testing job-demand-control theory have, however, provided mixed results, with only roughly half of empirical studies supporting the theorized "buffering" effect of job control (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.94,341.36,111.79,8.80" target="#b60">Van der Doef &amp; Maes, 1999</ref> for a review). As such, researchers began to realize that the provision of control helps some people-those with high self-efficacy, proactivity, and internal locus of control-cope with job demands but not others <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.27,365.40,201.81,8.80" target="#b40">(Meier, Semmer, Elfering, &amp; Jacobshagen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,434.84,365.40,70.04,8.80;2,44.96,377.36,22.70,8.80" target="#b46">Parker &amp; Sprigg, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,70.24,377.36,142.72,8.80" target="#b49">Salanova, Peiró, &amp; Schaufeli, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.55,377.36,100.88,8.80" target="#b52">Schaubroeck et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,319.01,377.36,118.49,8.80" target="#b53">Schaubroeck &amp; Merritt, 1997)</ref>. Such extension is consistent with the overarching principle that strain is a product of the ongoing interaction between situational features and individual characteristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,212.49,401.40,146.40,8.80" target="#b16">Cooper, Dewe, &amp; O'Driscoll, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,362.38,401.40,96.57,8.80" target="#b23">Griffin &amp; Clarke, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.45,401.40,42.45,8.80;2,44.96,413.36,62.25,8.80" target="#b33">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose that job autonomy 2 attenuates the relationship between job complexity trajectory and employee job strain only when the focal employee is high in emotional stability ( <ref type="figure" coords="2,368.86,437.40,31.12,8.80">Figure 1</ref>). Emotional stability captures individuals' predisposition to experience negative affect <ref type="bibr" coords="2,301.44,449.36,62.99,8.80" target="#b38">(McCrae, 1990)</ref>. We focus on emotional stability among the primary dimensions of personality because emotional stability-or its opposite form, neuroticism-is the strongest determinant of psychological distress, as shown in the meta-analysis conducted by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,457.63,473.40,47.25,8.80;2,44.96,485.36,76.85,8.80" target="#b58">Swider and Zimmerman (2010)</ref>.

Following this line of research, we suggest that employee emotional stability is particularly relevant as to whether employees can utilize job autonomy effectively to deal with the mental demands and challenges in a job.</p><p>In sum, this paper aims to contribute to literature in three ways. First, we extend the understanding of the relationship between job complexity and job strain by introducing the idea of individual trajectory, or intra-individual variability over time. We seek to establish that systematic increases or decreases in job complexity over time explain unique variance in employee job strain. Second, we demonstrate the relevance of dynamic changes in work characteristics over time when trying to understand their effects on employees. Taking trends into account can be a promising avenue to further shed light on the relationships between work characteristics and employees' well-being as well as important work behaviors (such as job performance and OCB). In short, rather than focusing only on where employees are to predict how they will be or behave, we suggest that research on work design can benefit from also taking into account what employees have been through. Third, we seek to advise managers on managing increasing job complexities for employees, such as allowing sufficient time for employees to master new skills before taking on new responsibilities, shaping employee expectation on future job complexity, and ensuring job autonomy for highemotional-stability employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory and Hypotheses</head><p>The power of trajectory Employees' experience at work unfolds and likely changes over time. For instance, employees' job satisfaction may vary with changes in compensation and task structures as well as certain positive or negative events at work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,497.71,413.36,24.25,8.80;3,62.02,425.38,46.15,8.80" target="#b11">(Chen et al., 2011)</ref>. Boswell and colleagues identified the pattern for employees to have high job satisfaction when taking on a new job, and job satisfaction may in general decline over time <ref type="bibr" coords="3,336.53,437.40,147.43,8.80" target="#b8">(Boswell, Boudreau, &amp; Tichy, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.00,437.40,34.96,8.80;3,62.02,449.36,134.45,8.80" target="#b9">Boswell, Shipp, Payne, &amp; Culbertson, 2009</ref>). In addition, research on justice perceptions reveals that individuals' perception of justice varies substantially over months or even on a daily basis <ref type="bibr" coords="3,357.96,461.38,100.82,8.80" target="#b29">(Holtz &amp; Harold, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,463.87,461.38,58.10,8.80;3,62.02,473.40,70.10,8.80" target="#b36">Loi, Yang, &amp; Diefendorff, 2009</ref>). According to gestalt characteristics theory, individuals reflect on their past experience (e.g., job satisfaction and justice) to project their future state; such projection in turn influences their current experience <ref type="bibr" coords="3,62.02,497.38,99.50,8.80" target="#b1">(Ariely &amp; Carmon, 2003)</ref>. In retrospection on their experience profile, people do not reflect on each individual component of the profile or combine the intensity of the transient states. Instead, because of limitations in human cognition, they tend to extract two gestalt characteristics of their experience profile-a static characteristic that reflects a particular key point in time (e.g., the peak or the final moment) and a dynamic characteristic that reflects the change in the intensity of the states as experience progresses (i.e., the trend of the profile). Research in behavioral decision making supports the effects of these two gestalt characteristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,339.65,557.36,117.89,8.80" target="#b2">Ariely &amp; Loewenstein, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,460.58,557.36,61.39,8.80;3,62.02,569.38,51.54,8.80" target="#b35">Loewenstein &amp; Prelec, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, some organizational behavior scholars started to examine the power of trend, or trajectory, in predicting important work outcomes. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,223.20,593.36,110.48,8.80" target="#b48">Reb and Cropanzano (2007)</ref>, via an experiment, revealed that an improving trend of performance over a given period has a strong, positive effect on the final performance evaluation, given the performance mean over the period controlled. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,255.35,617.40,102.13,8.80" target="#b27">Hausknecht et al. (2011)</ref> applied gestalt characteristics theory to address how the temporal patterns of justice perception influence important work outcomes. They established that, after controlling for the end-state levels of justice, an increasing trend (i.e., positive trajectory) in individual fairness Figure 1. Theoretical model perception is associated with higher organizational commitment, higher job satisfaction, and lower turnover intentions. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,119.40,89.36,72.53,8.80" target="#b11">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> advanced understanding of the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intentions by showing how the trend in job satisfaction influences employees' turnover intentions beyond average job satisfaction in a given period. They showed that the trajectory of job satisfaction serves to shape employees' expectations about their future in the organizations, which in turn influences their intent to leave. Later, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,44.96,137.38,65.96,8.80" target="#b34">Liu et al. (2012)</ref> extended the unique effect of job satisfaction trajectory to predict employees' actual turnover behavior. More important, they further demonstrated that the effect of job satisfaction trajectory is contingent on the social cues pertaining to the trajectory of unit satisfaction and the dispersion of satisfaction within the unit.</p><p>The accumulated research shows that the trajectory approach helps advance the understanding of some traditionally held relationships in organizational behavior, such as justice-attitudes and satisfaction-turnover. In this article, we seek to apply such perspective to the job complexity-strain relationship. As such, we not only answer to the call for a dynamic view on work characteristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,240.38,209.38,82.85,8.80" target="#b22">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</ref>), but also extend gestalt characteristic theory to the domain of work design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job complexity trajectory and job strain</head><p>Job complexity refers to "the extent to which the tasks on a job are complex and difficult to perform," and a complex job "requires the use of numerous high-level skills and is more mentally demanding and challenging" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,451.11,293.40,53.79,8.80;4,44.96,305.36,65.67,8.80" target="#b43">(Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,110.63,305.36,24.22,8.80">: 1323</ref>. The work contents are usually dynamic and flexible, rather than routine and static (Chung-Yan &amp; Butler, 2011). Consequentially, complex jobs usually require additional or sustained physical, psychological, as well as emotional effort from employees. According to job-demand-control theory <ref type="bibr" coords="4,388.98,329.40,62.48,8.80" target="#b32">(Karasek, 1979)</ref>, such excessive demands derived from complex tasks will cause significant strain in employees. In comparison, a simple job requires only a minimum level of skill and knowledge, and employees can easily fulfill the demands of their work and experience little job strain. In addition, the cybernetic model of stress <ref type="bibr" coords="4,347.25,365.40,119.32,8.80" target="#b17">(Cummings &amp; Cooper, 1979)</ref> indicates that job strain originates from the discrepancy between goals and actual conditions. In complex jobs, tasks are more difficult and complicated, which adds uncertainty to whether employees can accomplish the task. The failure to accomplish the assigned tasks will in turn cause strain.</p><p>As noted earlier, employees' perception of job complexity is likely to change over time. Employees might experience decreasing job complexity over time as they gradually master the knowledge and skills needed at work. In this case, these employees have a negative job complexity trajectory. On the other hand, some employees might experience a positive job complexity trajectory when their work contents and tasks are restructured to a more advanced level or when they are assigned new set of tasks.</p><p>To illustrate, suppose employee A and B have the same end-state job complexity. In arriving at this end state, however, employee A experienced a declining trajectory in job complexity while B experienced an increasing one. In other words, employee A used to have higher job complexity, and employee B used to have lower job complexity. From a traditional, static view, one might expect that employee A should have the same job strain as employee B, given the same end-state job complexity they experience. Nonetheless, by taking into account the dynamic nature of complexity, we speculate that employee A should experience less job strain than employee B because of the decreasing trajectory.</p><p>Gestalt characteristics theory <ref type="bibr" coords="4,172.69,557.36,96.86,8.80" target="#b0">(Ariely &amp; Carmon, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,269.55,557.36,25.86,8.80" target="#b1">, 2003</ref> posits that individuals have a strong preference for improving sequences. That is because individuals naturally draw expectations for future state based on their past and current experience, and incorporate such expectations into their evaluation of the current state-a process Ariely and Carmon term "naïve extrapolation." With a deteriorating sequence, individuals are likely to predict that the situation will continue to worsen. Such anticipated negativity, in turn, is likely to make the present experience feel worse. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,44.96,617.40,72.19,8.80" target="#b11">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> provided substantial support to such notion by showing that an increasing job satisfaction trajectory is associated with more positive expectations at work, which further reduces employees' intent to leave. Applying this idea to our context, we argue that, when an employee experiences an increasing trend of job complexity, he/she will anticipate that the job complexity will continue to increase in the future-that is, work will be more and more mentally demanding and challenging. Such negative anticipation not only directly adds to employees' anxiety, but also renders the current level of job complexity more intimidating and more draining. Comparatively, a decreasing job complexity trajectory indicates a continuous improvement over time and instills the expectation that the job will get easier and easier. Such an expectation relieves employees from anxiety and stress, and helps employees better deal with the current level of job complexity.</p><p>The trajectory also varies in degrees. A more positive (negative) trajectory indicates greater increments (decrements) in job complexity over time. Sharper declines or improvements in a perception/attitude over time are "more salient than more moderate declines or improvements because they are more noticeable, meaningful, and informative to employees" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,139.98,185.40,94.30,8.80">(Chen et al., 2011: 163)</ref>. A more positive trajectory in job complexity is associated with higher perceived job strain than a less positive trajectory. In the same way, a more negative trajectory leads to lower job strain than a less negative trajectory. Accordingly, we expect the following.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: With the average level of job complexity during a given period held constant, job complexity trajectory is positively related to job strain. Greater increments (decrements) in job complexity are associated with higher (lower) job strain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autonomy and emotional stability on job complexity trajectory → strain</head><p>The relationship above is built on the premise that dealing with mental demand and challenge inherent in a complex job represents negative experience to employees, thus the anticipation of more complexity in the future drains employees and the expectation of less complexity relieves them. Nonetheless, we recognize that the extent to which dealing with job complexity represents negative and draining experience may vary across different contexts and different individuals <ref type="bibr" coords="5,134.88,377.36,96.83,8.80" target="#b23">(Griffin &amp; Clarke, 2011)</ref>. The strength of the relationship between job complexity trajectory and employee strain is in turn contingent on certain contextual and individual factors.</p><p>In particular, job-demand-control theory posits that employees' job control, or decision latitudes, over work can mitigate the adverse effects of job demands on job strain. According to <ref type="bibr" coords="5,351.61,413.36,60.18,8.80" target="#b32">Karasek (1979)</ref>, high job demands in conjunction with high job control can make the job "active" and facilitate employees' learning and development of new skills, which are critical in sustaining employees' vitality at work <ref type="bibr" coords="5,327.35,437.40,123.88,8.80" target="#b20">(Fritz, Lam, &amp; Spreitzer, 2011)</ref>. Thus, by letting employees have control over their time and authority over their decisions at work, the adverse effect of job demands can be to some extent "buffered." In other words, dealing with the mental demands and challenges in a complex job will become less of an unpleasant experience when employees have autonomy at work. As such, the expectation of more job complexity in the future-derived from an increasing trajectory-should result in less job strain when the focal employee has high autonomy during the given period.</p><p>Accumulated research, however, presents mixed results on the constructive effect of job autonomy (Van der Doef &amp; Maes, 1999). Specifically, while some employees can take advantage of job control to cope with the adverse effects of job demands, job control may fail to help dealing with job demands for other employees. With higher job autonomy, employees enjoy more flexibility and authority to make decisions in their own work. At the same time, however, job autonomy also adds uncertainty to work and increases the focal employee's responsibility on work outcomes <ref type="bibr" coords="5,90.59,569.38,114.87,8.80" target="#b25">(Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980)</ref>. As a result, the job-demand-control model has been extended to incorporate individual characteristics into the interaction between job demands and job control. Extant research establishes that the "buffering" effect of job control tends to hold for individuals with higher self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" coords="5,430.58,593.36,91.36,8.80" target="#b49">(Salanova et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,62.02,605.38,105.81,8.80" target="#b52">Schaubroeck et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,172.06,605.38,123.48,8.80" target="#b53">Schaubroeck &amp; Merritt, 1997)</ref>, more proactive personality <ref type="bibr" coords="5,417.89,605.38,99.78,8.80" target="#b46">(Parker &amp; Sprigg, 1999)</ref>, and higher internal locus of control <ref type="bibr" coords="5,207.84,617.40,76.77,8.80" target="#b40">(Meier et al., 2008)</ref>.

Therefore, for more neurotic employees, dealing with job complexity represents a negative experience regardless of their job autonomy over the given period. As such, the anticipation of higher job complexity in the future-results from an increasing job complexity trajectory-should significantly increase employee job strain, no matter how much job autonomy the focal employee had. In contrast, high-emotional-stability individuals tend to actively cope with problems, and the decision latitudes will relieve them off time pressures and enable them to deal with the mental and skill demands in the way they feel most comfortable. That is, for less neurotic employees, dealing with job complexity will become less of a negative experience when they have higher job autonomy; therefore, the effect of job complexity trajectory on job strain should be weaker when the employee has more job autonomy over a given period.</p><p>To conclude, we contend that job autonomy can buffer the effect of job complexity trajectory on employee job strain only when the focal employee has high emotional stability; whereas such buffering effect of job autonomy tends to dissipate when the focal employee has lower emotional stability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and sample</head><p>The data to test our hypotheses comes from the Household, Income, and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey <ref type="bibr" coords="6,75.86,527.37,103.30,8.80" target="#b57">(Summerfield et al., 2011)</ref>, which is publicly available. The HILDA Survey is a broad social and economic longitudinal survey that focuses on household formation, income and work-related topics. HILDA comprises four different instruments: the Household Form, the Household Questionnaire, the Person Questionnaire, and the Self-Completion Questionnaire. The first three questionnaires are completed during an interview and the Self-Completion Questionnaire is collected by the interviewer at a later date or returned by mail. The Self-Completion Questionnaire includes mainly attitudinal questions, many of which cover topics that respondents may feel slightly uncomfortable answering in a face-to-face interview. The subjects in the data are household based. If there is more than one adult in a household, only one adult responds to the survey. The sample selection process is as follows:</p><p>More detailed information on the HILDA survey is available in the official manual <ref type="bibr" coords="7,412.78,117.37,104.89,8.80" target="#b57">(Summerfield et al., 2011)</ref>. Participants are invited to complete the survey every year from 2001 to 2010. Among the core variables in this study, job complexity, job strain, and job autonomy were collected for each person over 10 years from 2001 to 2010 (although there are missing years for some participants). As personality is considered to be relatively stable over time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="7,106.93,165.39,57.62,8.80" target="#b15">Conley, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,168.21,165.39,119.48,8.80" target="#b26">Hampson &amp; Goldberg, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,291.35,165.39,144.42,8.80" target="#b56">Specht, Egloff, &amp; Schmukle, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,439.44,165.39,82.53,8.80;7,62.02,177.41,66.79,8.80" target="#b59">Vaidya, Gray, Haig, &amp; Watson, 2002)</ref>, Big Five personality traits were assessed only in year 2005 and year 2009. Because of this restriction of the data on personality, we rely on two sets of three-year longitudinal data to test our theoretical model.</p><p>The first set of data ranges from 2004 to 2006. To test our model, we calculate a subject's job complexity trajectory based on their reported job complexity in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,246.73,213.41,84.96,8.80">2004, 2005, and 2006</ref>. The idea of trajectory is different from the traditional approach of using difference scores between Time 1 and Time 2 to operationalize change over time. Instead, trajectory is designed to model the temporal changes over multiple measurement times. Specifically, researchers use random coefficient models (also known as hierarchical linear models <ref type="bibr" coords="7,347.99,249.41,104.75,8.80" target="#b4">[Bliese &amp; Ployhart, 2002]</ref>) and calculate a Bayes slope estimate for each individual. A positive value indicates a general increase of the focal variable over time (the more positive, the greater the increase), and vice versa.</p><p>We use job complexity trajectory to predict employee job strain in year 2006, while controlling for average job complexity <ref type="bibr" coords="7,110.55,297.37,22.51,8.80">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,133.07,297.37,4.50,8.80">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,137.57,297.37,22.51,8.80">(2006)</ref>, demographic variables (age and gender in 2005), and perceived job security in 2005. For moderators, we use the average job autonomy over three years <ref type="bibr" coords="7,333.02,309.39,107.47,8.80">(i.e., 2004, 2005, and 2006</ref>) and emotional stability (measured in 2005). We test the idea of trajectory based on the three-year time frame (as opposed to 4 or above) for several reasons. First, given the fact that personality is only assessed in 2005 and 2009, using a three-year time frame allows us to conduct analyses and replications with two data sets that were not overlapping. Second, the use of three-year time frame is also consistent with the existing research studying trajectories <ref type="bibr" coords="7,445.61,357.41,76.40,8.80" target="#b11">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,62.02,369.37,95.61,8.80" target="#b27">Hausknecht et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,159.93,369.37,61.17,8.80" target="#b34">Liu et al., 2012)</ref>. Third, although at least three time points are necessary to capture a reliable change pattern over time, there is no rule of thumb as to how many time points are ideal. Nonetheless, when more time points are included, a curvilinear or quadratic pattern, rather than a linear pattern, may become more accurate in reflecting the change over time. As we theorize the linear pattern of job complexity change over time, three time points seem sufficient and appropriate for our research purpose. Fourth, the core to gestalt characteristic theory is that the previous experience will shape an individual's perception of the current state in the form of a trend. We believe that the experience of job complexity four or five years ago is no longer salient or vivid to the focal individuals.</p><p>We deal with the missing data through list-wise deletion. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,301.95,451.12,3.75,5.87">3</ref> We also exclude those respondents who change their jobs in the middle of the three years, as job changing might confound the effect of job complexity trajectories over the three years. We reran our models using multiple imputation to investigate whether the list-wise deletion of missing data could bias our results. As some variables had an extreme amount of missing data, we used a high number of imputations (Enders [2010] recommends a minimum of 20 imputations to achieve a similar level of power as missing increases past 50% on a particular variable; we applied 40 imputations as recommended by <ref type="bibr" coords="7,494.59,597.69,27.47,7.04;7,62.02,606.70,17.15,7.04" target="#b21">Graham, 2009)</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job strain</head><p>Job strain was collected in the Self-Completion Questionnaire with two items ("My job is more stressful than I had ever imagined" and "I fear that the amount of stress in my job will make me physically ill"). The 7-point Likert scale was applied to reflect the degree to which the subjects agree/or disagree ("1", strongly disagree, to "7", strongly agree). Data on job strain used in the analysis were assessed in year 2006 (Cronbach's α = .81) and in year 2010 (Cronbach's α = .80). We recognized that this two-item measure does not come from an established scale. Existing literature in general captures strain in three ways (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,268.10,218.91,122.60,8.80" target="#b60">Van der Doef &amp; Maes, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,394.58,218.91,110.32,8.80;8,44.95,230.87,76.71,8.80" target="#b62">Van Vegchel, de Jonge, &amp; Landsbergis, 2005)</ref>.

Specifically, we surveyed 82 currently employed individuals in the United States through Amazon Mechanical Turk.

The scale of emotional exhaustion asks participants how often they experienced the feelings such as "I feel emotionally drained from my work" and "I feel burned out from my work." The scale of anxiety-contentment asks participants to rate how much of the time, in the past month, their job had made them feel (1) tense, (2) uneasy, (3) worried, (4) anxious, (5) contented, (6) relaxed, (7) calm, and <ref type="formula" coords="8,306.77,422.89,11.44,8.80">(8)</ref> comfortable. Results showed that our measure is correlated with emotional exhaustion at .76, and is correlated with anxiety at .70.

All items were measured on a 9-point Likert scale, with each response gauging the extent to which each particular adjective described the respondent accurately. The actual items used in the HILDA measure are as follows: (i) Emotional stability-envious (reversed), moody (reversed), touchy (reversed), jealous (reversed), temperamental (reversed), and fretful (reversed); (ii) Extroversion-talkative, bashful (reversed), quiet (reversed), shy (reversed), lively, and extroverted; (iii) Agreeableness-sympathetic, kind, cooperative, and warm; (iv) Conscientiousness-orderly, systematic, inefficient (reversed), sloppy (reversed), disorganized (reversed), and efficient; and (v) Openness to experience-deep, philosophical, creative, intellectual, complex, imaginative. Although the HILDA dataset itself only provides the aggregated measures for each of the five traits (making our own calculation of internal consistency impossible), the HILDA organization reports <ref type="bibr" coords="9,198.59,348.91,62.23,8.80" target="#b64">(Wooden, 2012</ref>) the following internal consistency statistics for the 2005 and 2009 measures, respectively: Emotional Stability (α = .81; .81), Extroversion (α = .74; .74), Agreeableness (α = .78; .79), Conscientiousness (α = .78; .78), and Openness to experience (α = .74; .75).

Hence, Hypothesis 1 is supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis tests with 2008-2010 sample</head><p>Also, Model 8 in <ref type="table" coords="13,147.01,473.40,31.31,8.80" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows that the three-way interaction between job complexity trajectory, job autonomy and employee emotional stability is significant (B = À.32, p &lt; .05). The conditional effects of job complexity trajectory exhibit a very similar pattern to that of the 2004-2006 data. When employees have high emotional stability, the interactive effect of job complexity trajectory and job autonomy is significant (interactive effect: B = À.46, t = À2.28, p &lt; .05, 95% CI = [À.85, À.06]). Specifically, the effect of complexity trajectory on job strain is stronger for those with low job autonomy (B = 2.77, t = 6.81, p &lt; .01, 95% CI = [1.97, 3.57]) than those with high job autonomy (B = 1.53, t = 3.80, p &lt; .01, 95% CI = [.74, 2.31]). In comparison, the interaction of job complexity trajectory and job autonomy is not significant for employees with low emotional stability (interactive effect: B = .20, t = 1.01, p &gt; .10, 95% CI = [À.19, .59]). That is, the "buffering" effect of job autonomy only holds when employees have high emotional stability. Specifically, when employees have low emotional stability, the effects of job complexity trajectory on employee job strain are similar across employees with low job autonomy (B = 1.97, t = 5.63, p &lt; .01, 95% CI = [1.29, 2.66]) or high job autonomy (B = 2.52, t = 5.91, p &lt; .01, 95% CI = [1.68, 3.35]). To aid interpretation, we plotted the conditional effects for employees with high emotional stability in <ref type="figure" coords="13,73.13,629.36,38.62,8.80" target="#fig_5">Figure 3a</ref> and for employees with low emotional stability in <ref type="figure" coords="13,322.31,629.36,37.59,8.80" target="#fig_5">Figure 3b</ref>. Taken together, Hypothesis 2 is again supported in this second sample. downward trajectory, holding constant their average job complexity over time. Our study also sheds light on how this effect is jointly moderated by job autonomy and employees' emotional stability (H2). Specifically, for employees with higher emotional stability, job autonomy during the given period manages to mitigate the strain brought on by the increasing job complexity trajectory <ref type="figure" coords="15,281.77,593.36,76.04,8.80" target="#fig_5">(Figures 2a and 3a)</ref>; whereas for those with lower emotional stability, job autonomy did not make a difference in the relationship between job complexity trajectory and job strain <ref type="figure" coords="15,62.02,617.40,78.12,8.80" target="#fig_5">(Figures 2b and 3b)</ref>. Further, three empirical strengths of our study are noteworthy. First, a large sample size (more than 4000) increases the power of our study to confirm a three-way interaction effect. Second, our sample allows for generalization beyond a specific company or profession. With the nation-wide, relatively random sampling design, people in our study are sampled from different ages, races, professions, companies, etc. Third, by extracting, analyzing, and replicating our results in two different longitudinal datasets from two different time periods, we provide strong support for the theoretical model. We recognize that the variances explained by job complexity trajectory and its three-way interaction are relatively small, which to some extent casts doubt on the practical implications of our findings. We speculate that the time interval (one year) of capturing job complexity over time is likely responsible for such small variances explained. Existing organizational studies examining the effect of trajectory use much shorter timeframes. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="16,44.96,173.38,104.42,8.80" target="#b27">Hausknecht et al. (2011)</ref> captured perceived justice trajectory with three months as the interval. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,457.63,173.38,47.27,8.80;16,44.96,185.40,26.44,8.80" target="#b11">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> conducted three studies and use intervals ranging from one month to three months. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,418.74,185.40,86.14,8.80" target="#b9">Boswell et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="16,62.42,197.36,66.07,8.80" target="#b34">Liu et al. (2012)</ref> measured job satisfaction every six months, which is the longest interval adopted in existing organizational studies on trajectories. Although there is no clear guideline on the timeframe for capturing a trajectory, <ref type="bibr" coords="16,66.39,221.40,107.14,8.80" target="#b1">Ariely and Carmon (2003)</ref> note that memory decay may play a role in shaping individuals' summary assessment of a trend. When forming a summary assessment of a certain experience, how long ago would an individual recall to retrieve related information remains an open empirical question. The timeframe we adopt in this study is substantially longer than the existing experimental and organizational studies on gestalt characteristics theory. We speculate that the effect of trajectory identified in our study is diluted as a result of the year-long interval imposed by the archival data we use.</p><p>The small effect sizes of our findings may also result from the relatively limited variance of job complexity trajectory that we observe in our data (M = .06, SD = .11 in the 2004-2006 data, and M = À.02, SD = .09 in the 2008-2010 data), compared to existing research on job satisfaction trajectory that normally report a standard deviation from .15 to .31 <ref type="bibr" coords="16,143.77,329.40,77.81,8.80" target="#b11">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,225.47,329.40,66.05,8.80" target="#b34">Liu et al., 2012)</ref>. As we noted, employees are more likely to experience a salient increasing trajectory of job complexity when they face major task restructuring, which often occurs with organizational changes, work procedures improvement, new information technology adoption, and company downsizing. In other situations without major work changes or events, the change of job complexity (and other work characteristics) over time may be less dramatic. Therefore, we encourage future research to study job complexity trajectory in contexts where researchers can capture more dramatic changes in job complexity, such as newcomer socialization. Newcomers are more likely to experience increasing job complexity as they are assigned more sophisticated tasks over time. Alternatively, researchers can also study changes in job complexity in companies that are going through major organizational changes. We speculate that, by capturing more variance in job complexity trajectory, the explanatory power of job complexity trajectory and the interactive effects can be improved.</p><p>Still, our study represents an early or initial investigation on the trajectory perspective of work characteristics and its contingencies. Even with our modest explained variance, our theory grounded, theory informed, and significant results justify future research aimed at replicating, expanding upon, or simply falsifying our "early on" research. In other words, we focus more on avoiding Type 2, instead of Type 1, errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>Our paper contributes to the literature of work design, gestalt characteristics theory, and job-demand-control theory. First, this study suggests that considering the trajectory of work characteristics is a promising perspective in examining dynamics in work characteristics and can improve our understanding of the relationships between work design and relevant employee outcomes. Researchers have long called for more dynamic perspectives on examining work design <ref type="bibr" coords="16,160.27,605.38,73.03,8.80" target="#b10">(Brousseau, 1983)</ref>; one of them is to look at the reciprocal process between work characteristics and employee outcomes <ref type="bibr" coords="16,205.86,617.40,93.38,8.80" target="#b22">(Grant &amp; Parker, 2009)</ref>. As an example, <ref type="bibr" coords="16,373.73,617.40,106.72,8.80" target="#b14">Clegg and Spencer (2007)</ref> show that employees with higher performance gain more trust from managers; managers, in turn, offer more autonomy and allow them to expand their roles, which further leads to higher intrinsic motivation and consequentially higher job performance. Our research suggests another avenue in exploring the dynamics of work characteristics. Drawing on gestalt characteristics theory, we suggest that researchers can improve the prediction of employee work outcomes by going beyond using where employees are to predict how they will be or behave; instead, we should extend the focus to include where they were or what they have been through. Future research might study trajectories or trends of other work characteristics and extend the outcomes of interest to job performance, OCB, and turnover. This line of research can provide insights on managerial restructuring of employees' work. For example, although job autonomy is in general thought to increase employees' intrinsic motivation and performance, an abrupt increase in autonomy-without giving sufficient time for adaptation-might back fire and increase employees' pressure without enhancing motivation.</p><p>Second, this paper advances gestalt characteristics theory by not only extending its application to the context of work design, but, more importantly, also examining it in a context where the positivity or negativity of an experience is less clear. Early psychological studies on gestalt characteristics theory focus on unpleasant experiences such as discomfort, medical procedures, and queuing, while giving little attention to pleasant experiences <ref type="bibr" coords="17,493.52,221.40,28.39,8.80;17,62.02,233.36,69.62,8.80" target="#b1">(Ariely &amp; Carmon, 2003)</ref>. In contrast, recent organizational studies examining experience trajectory focus on positive and pleasant experiences such as job satisfaction and perceived justice. These two streams of research consistently examine the experiences that are clearly deemed as positive or negative. In our paper, we suggest that the positivity/negativity of the experience of dealing with job complexity might vary across different contexts and different individuals; thus, the effect of job complexity trajectory on job strain is in turn contingent on certain contextual and individual factors. As such, the presented research offers a new perspective on exploring the contingencies of the dynamic gestalt characteristic-that is, taking into consideration the factors that might shape the negativity or positivity of a certain experience. We believe that such perspective is critical as gestalt characteristics theory is applied to a broader range of organizational experiences that have seemingly less clear labels of positivity or negativity.</p><p>Third, the moderating role of emotional stability identified in our study contributes to job-demand-control theory <ref type="bibr" coords="17,93.03,365.40,67.04,8.80" target="#b32">(Karasek, 1979)</ref> by bridging it to emotional stability and the exposure-reactivity model <ref type="bibr" coords="17,478.38,365.40,43.59,8.80;17,62.02,377.36,73.93,8.80" target="#b7">(Bolger &amp; Zuckerman, 1995)</ref>. Job-demand-control theory is one of the most influential theories in the literature of job stress. Although the notion that job control can "buffer" the adverse effect of job demand on job strain has received substantial support since its introduction, there are also a large number of studies failing to support it. The mixed empirical evidence is to some extent attributed to differences in the measurement of job demands and strain (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,156.36,425.38,125.64,8.80" target="#b60">Van der Doef &amp; Maes, 1999)</ref>. However, there is a growing consensus that individual differences play an important role in whether job control can be utilized to counter the strain brought by job demands <ref type="bibr" coords="17,120.25,449.37,83.93,8.80" target="#b40">(Meier et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,209.31,449.37,100.43,8.80" target="#b46">Parker &amp; Sprigg, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,314.88,449.37,93.51,8.80" target="#b49">Salanova et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,413.52,449.37,108.48,8.80" target="#b52">Schaubroeck et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,62.02,461.38,123.26,8.80" target="#b53">Schaubroeck &amp; Merritt, 1997)</ref>. Our findings lend supports to this important direction for refining and improving job-demand-control theory. More important, we introduce <ref type="bibr" coords="17,337.33,473.40,139.14,8.80" target="#b7">Bolger and Zuckerman's (1995)</ref> exposurereactivity model to explain why individual characteristics make a difference in the "buffering" effect of job control-that is, job control does not help to mitigate job strain for some employees because they rely on more on passive and emotion-based coping strategies, rather than active and problem-solving strategies where job control will be useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>Our results indicate that an increasing trend of job complexity is associated with higher employee job strain. The more dramatic that increase is, the more additional job strain is brought to an employee. In some cases, task restructuring for employees occurs when organizations/teams adopt new work procedures, use a new information system, or reallocate tasks because of downsizing <ref type="bibr" coords="17,272.58,617.40,93.15,8.80" target="#b44">(Nikolova et al., 2014)</ref>. As such, new skills and knowledge are required of them, which may result in a significant increase in employees' perceived job complexity and in turn more strain.</p><p>Based on our findings, we have several suggestions for managers and organizations to minimize the adverse effect of increasing job complexity on employee job strain. First, managers and organizations should plan ahead and allow sufficient time for the employees to gradually learn the new knowledge and skills required of the tasks before taking on them. As such, perceived job complexity will increase in a much steadier manner and the focal employee will experience less strain. Second, even when such planning ahead is not available because of time urgency or unexpected request, managers may still effectively intervene by directly shaping employees' expectation of future job complexity. This is because an upward job complexity trajectory, according to gestalt characteristics theory, increases employee strain by instilling the expectation that job complexity will continue to rise in the future. Third, when managers are choosing which employee to assign for the new tasks that require complex knowledge and skills, managers should tilt toward employees with higher emotional stability and ensure sufficient job autonomy, so that the incremental job strain can be minimized. As a final note, when managers believe that assigning some new tasks to employees may increase their job complexity, it may not necessarily appear the same way in the eyes of the focal employees. Therefore, bilateral communication is needed to confirm the newly added tasks are indeed increasing employees' perceived job complexity before applying the suggestions we address above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>Our study has several shortcomings that might require further investigations in the future. First, the timeframe for the effects of individual difference and job characteristics on job strain merit further investigation. According to <ref type="bibr" coords="18,471.47,321.86,33.39,8.80;18,44.96,333.88,68.12,8.80" target="#b42">Mitchell and James (2001)</ref>, the time when X and Y are measured is crucial for estimating the true strength of the relationship. In our study, data are collected annually. We cannot be sure whether a one-year interval is the most appropriate. As noted earlier, we speculate that one year as the length of the interval may have attenuated the effects of the trajectory found in our study, and is in part responsible for the small variance explained by the three-way interactions. To address this, we suggest that future research should examine the trajectory of job complexity work characteristics by shortening the time interval between assessments, and focusing on contexts where the change of work characteristics is more salient (i.e., during organizational change, or newcomer socialization).</p><p>Second, the measure of job complexity and job strain are not from well-established scales. Nonetheless, the evidence on the convergent validity of the two measures should lessen somewhat concerns with construct validity. Future research might adopt, however, more established scales for our focal constructs in order to replicate and/or extend our study.</p><p>Third, we speculate that employees' learning goal orientation and performance goal orientation may also be important contingencies on the effect of job complexity trajectory on employee job strain. Employees with high learning goal orientation may be motivated and enthused by the opportunities to learn new skills and knowledge as job complexity continue to increase. As such, the effect of an increasing trend of job complexity on job strain might be significantly attenuated when employees have high learning goal orientation.</p></div>
