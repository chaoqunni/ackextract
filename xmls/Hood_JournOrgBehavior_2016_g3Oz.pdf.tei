<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this research, we develop a framework for understanding the emergence of transactive memory systems (TMS) in project-based teams characterized by different levels of group level positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA). With a focus on enhancing understanding of the means of transmission, we test the mediating role played by group level psychological safety (PS) in the relationship between team affectivity and TMS. From a sample of 107 software implementation project teams, in a lagged field study, we find support for a mediated model in which high group NA, but not group PA, promotes environments psychologically unsafe for interpersonal risk-taking (low PS) and which are negatively associated with TMS. This study extends prior research on the differential effects of PA and NA, by contributing to the limited research on group affectivity, environmental antecedents of TMS, and the mediating role of PS for predicting group level transactive processes and structures.</p></div>

Research on transactive memory systems (TMS), a set of structures and processes that provides teams with an effective means to manage scarce resources <ref type="bibr" coords="1,482.30,452.76,22.70,8.80;1,44.96,464.78,64.21,8.80" target="#b24">(Faraj &amp; Sproull, 2000)</ref>, suggests that teams cope with resource constraints by dividing and sharing responsibilities for expertise and tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,98.40,476.80,83.47,8.80" target="#b75">(Ren &amp; Argote, 2011)</ref>. A central theme underlying this research has been the role of learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,479.00,476.80,25.91,8.80;1,44.96,488.76,85.31,8.80" target="#b55">Lewis, Lange, &amp; Gillis, 2005)</ref>.

As such, the purpose of the current study is to contribute to TM theory by examining TMS development through the lens of interpersonal risk-taking and learning in teams.</p><p>For example, establishing the architecture central to a TMS is fraught with a number of potentially risky interpersonal behaviors such as admitting information deficiencies, declaring expertise, justifying or defending expertise when challenged, and admitting lack of desire to accept responsibility for a particular expertise domain <ref type="bibr" coords="2,62.02,89.36,83.51,8.80" target="#b35">(Hollingshead, 1998)</ref>. Although TMS depends on willingness to engage in potentially risky behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="2,480.76,89.36,41.21,8.80;2,62.02,101.38,68.49,8.80" target="#b47">(Larsen &amp; Augustine, 2008)</ref>, factors encouraging or discouraging these behaviors have been largely overlooked in the TM literature. In particular, sensitivity to and perceptions of interpersonal threat or risk are likely to influence acceptance of risks associated with TMS. As such, we propose that teams' willingness to engage in these potentially risky behaviors may be largely determined by the team's dispositional affectivity.</p><p>Affectivity has been explicitly recognized as a critical stimulus in group environments <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.53,149.40,65.34,8.80" target="#b32">(Hackman, 1992)</ref>. In particular, positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA) are differentially associated with the direction, duration, and intensity with which personal resources (e.g., time, attention, and energy) are invested in social contexts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,450.04,173.38,71.86,8.80;2,62.02,185.40,20.76,8.80" target="#b14">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1990)</ref>.

The current study contributes by developing a connection between team affectivity and TMS. Second, we also seek to deepen understanding of the drivers of this association by examining the role played by psychological safety (PS) as a mediator. Specifically, as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="2,203.53,305.36,32.15,8.80" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we propose that differences between high/low team-level dispositional PA and NA lead to team-level perceptions of PS and TMS.</p><p>We begin with a review of our primary theoretical framework, TM theory. This is followed by hypothesis development and a brief overview of multi-level theory (MLT). Understanding MLT is an essential precursor to our methods section, as it provides the foundation necessary to understand the process through which our focal constructs, which are typically treated at the individual and dyadic levels of analysis, emerge to form team-level constructs. We then provide methods, results, discussion, and implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background and Theoretical Development</head><p>Transactive memory theory According to TM theory, TM is present at the individual and dyadic levels of analysis but often forms a meaningful phenomenon at the group level via compositional processes. At the individual level, TM refers to "…memory that is influenced by knowledge of the memory system of another person" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,337.55,77.40,88.41,8.80">(Lewis, 2003 p. 587)</ref>. TM has roots in information processing-a multi-stage operation consisting of phases such as attention (e.g., information must first be perceived/recognized in order to be processed), encoding (e.g., perceived information must be labeled and properly organized to facilitate its retention), storage (e.g., once organized, information must be preserved for future use), retrieval (e.g., stored information is cued using the previously employed organizing scheme), and application (e.g., only retrieved information is available to be brought to bear on cognitive tasks) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,387.84,137.38,49.23,8.80" target="#b22">(Ellis, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,439.83,137.38,65.10,8.80;3,44.96,149.40,21.43,8.80" target="#b24">Faraj &amp; Sproull, 2000)</ref>. Because of limits on individual cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" coords="3,286.53,149.40,61.35,8.80" target="#b89">(Wegner, 1987)</ref>, group members are compelled to rely on other members to share the burden of processing information for the performance of collective tasks and achievement of shared goals <ref type="bibr" coords="3,131.98,173.38,87.65,8.80" target="#b75">(Ren &amp; Argote, 2011)</ref>. A TMS begins to emerge as two or more individuals coordinate their respective TMs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,109.76,185.40,54.32,8.80" target="#b51">(Lewis, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Transactions refer to the interpersonal interactions and communications necessary to coordinate individual TMs and to cooperatively process information. For example, transactive retrieval occurs when an information seeker provides cues that remind a target of what she was wearing or what they were both eating the day that she likely encoded and stored a needed piece of information. As these transactions become more regular and predictable, individual TMs begin to converge to form a shared cognitive directory of the tasks, expertise, and people (as well as the linkages among them) needed to accomplish group objectives <ref type="bibr" coords="3,334.89,257.40,134.77,8.80" target="#b9">(Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004)</ref>. In this way, a TMS is a compositional emergent construct consisting of two or more TMs and the set of transactive processes that facilitate memory coordination <ref type="bibr" coords="3,230.18,281.38,102.90,8.80" target="#b54">(Lewis &amp; Herndon, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Transactive memory systems and learning <ref type="bibr" coords="3,44.96,341.36,60.57,8.80" target="#b89">Wegner (1987)</ref> argued that TMS is supported by three primary processes: (a) directory updating requires members to develop a shared cognitive directory composed of members' individual and collective learning regarding who knows what; (b) information allocation occurs when expertise is passed to one member based on what another member has learned about the target's willingness and ability to store it; (c) retrieval coordination is facilitated by members' understanding of the location, accessibility, and value of the expertise held by another <ref type="bibr" coords="3,458.03,389.38,46.88,8.80;3,44.96,401.40,49.55,8.80" target="#b8">(Borgatti &amp; Cross, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,54.93,413.36,103.66,8.80" target="#b8">Borgatti and Cross (2003)</ref> highlight a number of learning-oriented correlates of transactive processing. In a study of information scientists and genomic researchers, awareness, value, and accessibility were significantly related to dyadic transactive searching, but the cost of dyadic transactive search was not. In explaining this non-finding, the authors drew on the concept of PS, arguing that: "…cost functions as a characteristic of a group as a whole, affecting whether or how often people seek information from others in general, rather than as a determinant of who is sought out" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,65.02,473.40,130.13,8.80">(Borgatti &amp; Cross, 2003, p. 441)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,54.93,485.36,111.25,8.80">Yuan and colleagues (2010)</ref> challenged some of the implicit assumptions of TM theory by arguing that awareness of another's expertise is not enough to facilitate transactive retrieval. Instead, they argued that one must also learn how best to access one's expertise in order to successfully retrieve it. That is, members may have knowledge of which members possess what expertise; however, members may vary in their perceived ability or actual ability to access this knowledge when needed. We agree with these authors and seek to contribute to TM theory by exploring perceptions of interpersonal risk-taking and safety as necessary precursors for TMS-related learning.</p><p>Consistent with this aim, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,158.97,557.36,82.62,8.80" target="#b35">Hollingshead (1998)</ref> placed emphasis on self-disclosure as a means of learning about others' expertise as well as of establishing one's own expertise in the minds of other group members. Members may initially infer expertise credibility based on stereotypes, prior experience, or formal education. However, because these assumptions may be erroneous, they may lead to suboptimal task and expertise assignments if left unchecked. To refine their initial inferences, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,221.39,605.38,81.72,8.80" target="#b35">Hollingshead (1998)</ref> argued that members must establish their expertise through actions such as asserting one's expertise, elaborating one's background and experience, declaring insufficient knowledge in a particular domain, challenging or questioning the expertise of another, or demonstrating expertise by correctly addressing others' inquiries <ref type="bibr" coords="3,226.09,641.38,83.17,8.80" target="#b35">(Hollingshead, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, when TMS is underdeveloped, members may have little basis on which to make task and expertise assignments; in the absence of tangible evidence and personal experience, members may make task and expertise assignments arbitrarily, or on "…the basis of such irrelevant cues as appearance or demeanor…" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,388.63,101.38,86.92,8.80">(Moreland, 1999, p. 5)</ref>. Moreover, groups may allow members to take responsibility for whatever assignments they like best, rather than on the basis of qualification <ref type="bibr" coords="4,113.16,125.36,68.41,8.80" target="#b62">(Moreland, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,184.42,125.36,62.34,8.80" target="#b91">Weingart, 1992)</ref>. This may result in pairing people with tasks and expertise for which they are unqualified or poorly suited to maintain. As a result, the refinement and effective operation of TMS depends on an ongoing process of learning and modifications to existing TMS structures and processes <ref type="bibr" coords="4,425.43,149.40,75.78,8.80" target="#b55">(Lewis et al., 2005)</ref>. We expect these processes to be accompanied with interpersonal risks that members will be disinclined to accept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological safety</head><p>In the context of teams, PS refers to team members' assessment that the team's environment is safe for interpersonal risk-taking <ref type="bibr" coords="4,105.87,233.36,75.13,8.80" target="#b19">(Edmondson, 1999)</ref>. PS influences willingness to engage in potentially threatening behaviors, such as many of those associated with creativity and learning in groups. Edmonson describes group level learning as "…an ongoing process of reflection and action, characterized by asking questions, seeking feedback, experimenting, reflecting on results, and discussing errors or unexpected outcomes of actions" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,313.80,269.36,103.91,8.80">(Edmondson, 1999, p. 353)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,423.94,269.36,74.37,8.80" target="#b19">Edmondson (1999)</ref> noted that "…asking for help, admitting errors, and seeking feedback exemplify the kinds of behaviors that pose a threat to face <ref type="bibr" coords="4,81.53,293.40,56.42,8.80" target="#b10">(Brown, 1990)</ref>, and thus people in organizations are often reluctant to disclose their errors <ref type="bibr" coords="4,447.12,293.40,63.22,8.80" target="#b60">(Michael, 1973)</ref> or are unwilling to ask for help <ref type="bibr" coords="4,175.40,305.36,43.66,8.80" target="#b49">(Lee, 1997)</ref>, even when doing so would provide benefits for the team or organization…" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,62.02,317.38,110.22,8.80">(Edmondson, 1999, p. 352)</ref>. Thus, when PS is low, members will be reluctant to experiment <ref type="bibr" coords="4,449.06,317.38,73.05,8.80;4,62.02,329.40,105.87,8.80" target="#b50">(Lee, Edmondson, Thomke, &amp; Worline, 2004)</ref>, less creative <ref type="bibr" coords="4,225.31,329.40,97.24,8.80" target="#b31">(Gilson &amp; Shalley, 2004)</ref>, fearful of correction, and/or reticent to personally engage <ref type="bibr" coords="4,91.72,341.36,49.72,8.80" target="#b41">(Kahn, 1990)</ref>. We expect these factors to have an adverse impact on the refinement of a group's shared memory structures and processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological safety and transactive memory systems</head><p>Group members' perceptions regarding interpersonal risk-taking should impact TMS for a number of reasons. First, in order for a team to uncover gaps and make corrections in their coverage of expertise domains (TMS structure) and patterns of expertise coordination (TMS processes), they must feel safe to question assumptions and discuss issues in an open and honest way <ref type="bibr" coords="4,158.68,449.36,77.05,8.80" target="#b19">(Edmondson, 1999)</ref>. This is especially important given that initial task and expertise responsibilities are likely to be suboptimal and in need of renegotiation and realignment. For example, it may be assumed that David has expertise in domain X because he studied under Sara, a recognized expert in domain X. However, if David makes a mistake that is uncharacteristic of someone with expertise in domain X, then David's assignment as the team's domain X expert will come into question. The situation may become problematic if it becomes apparent that no one on the team has sufficient expertise to readily assume responsibility for domain X. As such, teams often need to experiment with different and sometimes creative combinations of tasks, expertise, and role assignments in order to achieve the most equitable and optimal division of cognitive labor.</p><p>Such behaviors make the refinement and operation of TMS akin to the learning and creativity often associated with PS. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,155.00,557.36,101.45,8.80" target="#b42">Kark and Carmeli (2009)</ref> found associations between PS and involvement in creative work processes. They argued that PS supports creative work engagement by helping to reduce defensiveness and anxiety related to learning. These authors contend that "…when individuals encounter new ideas and information that disconfirm their prior knowledge, expectations, or hopes, they may experience a sense of anxiety that will hinder their ability to learn" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,128.02,605.38,126.68,8.80">(Kark &amp; Carmeli, 2009, p. 788)</ref>.</p><p>In the context of TMS, disconfirming information may emerge when a member seeks expertise from a member mistakenly perceived to be an expert or when a member rejects a request to serve as an expert in a particular domain. Such instances may be common when TMS is underdeveloped as members seek and assign expertise responsibilities on the basis of erroneous or superficial information such as gender stereotypes <ref type="bibr" coords="5,330.35,77.40,123.05,8.80" target="#b36">(Hollingshead &amp; Fraidin, 2003)</ref>. Such information, when revealed to be erroneous, may be embarrassing or insulting to one or both parties.

For some, engaging in distributed information processing by relying largely on others to remember critical information represents a new and unfamiliar way of doing things.</p><p>Second, to be effective, TMS must be validated by group members by participating in the coordination of their own and others' TMs. Drawing on previous research (i.e., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,276.78,281.38,75.92,8.80" target="#b80">Stasser et al., 1995)</ref>, Brandon and Hollingshead proposed that "…coordination requires that group members accept responsibility for certain actions, that other group members accept responsibility for other areas, and that group members implicitly know that they share the same map of these responsibilities" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,112.42,317.38,163.53,8.80">(Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004, p. 640)</ref>.

Such failures are recognized when "…information possessed by a member is not utilized by the group, when members fail to retrieve information they possess, or when members fail to cue recall of information already possessed by another member" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,290.50,365.40,108.19,8.80">(Lewis et al., 2007, p. 165)</ref>.</p><p>Third, effective TMS requires a level of transparency and engagement that is likely impacted by PS perceptions. PS promotes learning through physical, cognitive, and emotional engagements. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,414.26,389.38,50.25,8.80" target="#b41">Kahn (1990)</ref> linked PS to the display of personally engaging behaviors such that members experiencing high levels of PS are "…physically involved in tasks, whether alone or with others, cognitively vigilant, and empathically connected to others in the service of the work they are doing in ways that display what they think and feel…" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,373.55,425.38,80.70,8.80">(Kahn, 1990, p. 700)</ref>. In contrast, in the absence of PS, members are more likely to become personally withdrawn and increase self-defensive behaviors in which they "…hide true identity, thoughts, and feelings during role performance…" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,417.37,449.37,83.36,8.80">(Kahn, 1990, p. 701)</ref>. Coordination errors are more likely when members have a poor understanding of the expertise possessed by overly guarded teammates.</p><p>Finally, to have an effective TMS, members assigned responsibility to maintain expertise in domains in which they are ill-equipped must feel safe to admit their deficiencies. However, admitting weakness can be embarrassing or used to demean or harm the self-esteem of the member whose expertise is in question. PS may create an environment where people are self-conscious about the risks associated with sharing potentially damaging revelations. For example, in a study of virtual communities, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,223.49,533.39,117.15,8.80">Zhang and colleagues (2010)</ref> reported that PS has a positive effect on community members' intentions to continue sharing knowledge in the community.

Low levels of PS hinder reallocation of expertise responsibilities to the most capable, confident, and willing team members.</p><p>In sum, the social exchanges necessary for effective TMS operation such as feedback seeking, information sharing, negotiation, discussion of errors, and experimentation <ref type="bibr" coords="5,296.23,605.39,78.78,8.80" target="#b19">(Edmondson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,377.64,605.39,81.39,8.80" target="#b35">Hollingshead, 1998)</ref> are fraught with interpersonal risks that members will be more or less willing or able to accept. However, by alleviating excessive concerns regarding the acceptability of interpersonal risk taking, PS can encourage enactment of potentially risky learning-oriented behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="5,206.59,641.39,78.53,8.80" target="#b19">(Edmondson, 1999)</ref>, which support the processes and structures inherent in a functioning TMS. When PS is high, members will be more willing to reallocate expertise roles and responsibilities and experiment with new ways of processing information. In contrast, contexts characterized by low PS are likely to discourage risk taking and instead promote restricted information processing and rigid adherence to initial and oftentimes erroneous member-expertise assignments. On this basis, we predict the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Team PS is positively related to TMS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negative affectivity and psychological safety</head><p>There are a number of reasons why we expect NA to contribute to a group environment perceived to be psychologically unsafe by its members. First, NA has been linked to an avoidance orientation characterized by "…sensitivity to negative/undesirable (i.e., punishment) stimuli (present or imagined) that is accompanied by perceptual vigilance for, affective reactivity to, and a behavioral predisposition away from such stimuli" <ref type="bibr" coords="6,395.55,353.38,118.17,8.80">(Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002, p. 805</ref>). This perspective is consistent with the expectation that NA is associated with the behavioral inhibition system (BIS), a physiological mechanism that constrains actions that might lead to harmful or painful consequences <ref type="bibr" coords="6,480.70,377.36,41.26,8.80;6,62.02,389.38,50.52,8.80" target="#b15">(Carver &amp; White, 1994)</ref>. Because NA increases sensitivity to stimuli that is negative or unfavorable, high NA groups are likely to be characterized by the highlighting of members' shortcomings and missteps while simultaneously discounting or overlooking one another's strengths and successes. This initial negative sensitivity may be compounded by the tendency of NA to be accompanied by rumination over one's own or others' errors and shortcomings, as well as time, attention, and energy spent attempting to recover from actual or potential resource losses <ref type="bibr" coords="6,458.93,437.40,58.54,8.80">(Hobfoll, 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,62.02,449.36,18.16,8.80" target="#b34">(Hobfoll, , 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,87.42,449.36,92.19,8.80" target="#b86">Watson &amp; Clark, 1984)</ref>. As cognitions influenced by NA are shared, stored, and coordinated by group members, a reluctance in the group to engage in learning-oriented behaviors such as admission of error or acknowledgement of a lack of understanding may emerge.</p><p>Affectivity is likely to have an impact on both risk perceptions and memory by biasing what information is noticed, encoded, stored, and retrieved from individuals' TMs. Research on mood congruence suggests that individuals will tend to more easily recall positive information while in a state of positive affect and negative information when in a state of negative affect <ref type="bibr" coords="6,174.50,521.36,58.34,8.80" target="#b6">(Blaney, 1986)</ref>. Moreover, state dependence research suggests that individuals tend to retrieve information from memory encoded in a mood state that is consistent with their current mood <ref type="bibr" coords="6,460.12,533.38,57.55,8.80" target="#b6">(Blaney, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>As such, although heightened vigilance to negative (positive) stimuli and environmental cues is likely to facilitate memory processes, NA (PA) is likely to bias memory functioning by promoting the encoding, storage, and recall of negative (positive) information over positive (negative) information. For example, when presented with an equal number of negative and positive cues about the value and costs of transacting with another member, high NA may lead to disproportionate attention to the risks and expense of transacting. In the case of a previous negative transaction (e.g., a usually reliable source of information uncharacteristically provides incorrect information), NA is likely to cause selective recall and/or rumination on the error rather than the previous track record of success. We argue that this process aggregates up to the group level through the process of retrieval coordination, as group members cue each other throughout the memory retrieval process.</p><p>In addition to biased perceptions towards negativity, NA also is likely to cause members to act in ways that contribute to an environment others are likely to perceive as interpersonally threatening. When faced with negative cues, high NA is likely to lead to stronger reactions than low NA. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,357.62,101.38,97.96,8.80" target="#b79">Spector and Fox (2002)</ref> argued that negative emotions increase the likelihood of avoidance of or attacks directed toward perceived sources of negative emotion. Because of their tendency to perceive and experience fear, anxiety, and anger, high NAs are likely to make others feel reticent to act in ways that could potentially antagonize or prolong their negative mood states. As such, the negative perceptions and behaviors exhibited by members experiencing negative mood states may spread to infect others, and ultimately the group itself, leading to a shared experience of negative affect and an overall tendency towards avoidance <ref type="bibr" coords="7,122.57,173.38,94.59,8.80" target="#b23">(Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,220.14,173.38,94.57,8.80" target="#b40">Kelly &amp; Barsade, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>While high NA is generally associated with feelings such as guilt, fear, and anxiety, low NA is associated with feelings of serenity and calmness <ref type="bibr" coords="7,185.28,197.36,189.89,8.80" target="#b38">(Kaplan, Bradley, Luchman, &amp; Haynes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,379.00,197.36,82.27,8.80" target="#b87">Watson et al., 1988)</ref>. As such, low NA groups are likely to be perceived as less punitive and more forgiving than high NA groups. Moreover, low NA groups are likely to have a greater composition of members with lower social anxiety and/or fear of failure. This suggests that NA not only contributes to collective perceptions of the environment as being psychologically unsafe, but NA also compels members, through their persistently negative mood states, to create a psychologically unsafe environment for others. Thus, we expect team NA to be associated with avoidance of interpersonal risk taking, as the costs of such behaviors are likely to be perceived as outweighing their benefits, leading to the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 2a: Team NA is negatively related to team PS.</p></div>

Specifically, we posit that NA leads to unfavorable assessments regarding the safety and viability of interpersonal risk taking, which in turn inhibits the development and maintenance of specialized, credible, and well-coordinated expertise-the hallmarks of a mature TMS. Establishing one's credibility (a key TMS activity) is fraught with interpersonal risks that high NAs are likely to avoid. NA creates an environment in which members are hesitant to call attention to their own errors, weaknesses or to those of others. Members of high NA groups are more likely to have doubt regarding the value and relevance of their own expertise, contributing to silence regarding their relevant qualifications and prior experiences.</p><p>They also are less likely to probe other members' expertise for fear of being seen as a troublemaker. This can prevent others from updating their respective cognitive directories, as well as the group's shared directory with information regarding whose expertise is most germane to which tasks. Because high NAs tend to react strongly and negatively to their own and other's mistakes and errors, they may insist on punishing those who make mistakes by stripping them of their expertise or task assignments <ref type="bibr" coords="8,295.71,290.91,92.02,8.80" target="#b79">(Spector &amp; Fox, 2002)</ref>.

These negative actions and reactions may spread throughout the group, leading to the emergence of a shared belief that the team is unsafe for risk taking and/or incapable of shared learning and information processing.

TMS is more likely to develop under favorable affective conditions (i.e., low NA or high PA) because members are more likely to feel safe sharing and seeking information and experimenting and challenging assumptions. However, under unfavorable affective conditions (i.e., high NA or low PA), TMS is less likely to develop because of psychological insecurity associated with engagement in potentially risky social exchanges inherent to TMS, leading to the following: Multi-level theory argued that "A phenomenon is emergent when it originates in the cognition, affect, behaviors, or other characteristics of individuals, is amplified by their interactions, and manifests as a higher level, collective phenomenon" (p. 55).

In order to support the development of the causal inferences we seek to draw, team members completed surveys at separate points in time, T0 and T1. Specifically, team affectivity was assessed in a pre-project survey at T0. PS-our proposed mediator-and TMS were measured at T1. From the 668 members of 121 initial ERP teams, we received usable data from 590 members of 107 project teams. The demographics of the final sample were compared with that of the 14 projects and 78 team members removed because of missing or incomplete data. No statistical differences between these teams were observed.</p><p>We collected data from teams of information technology (IT) professionals engaged in the implementation of supply chain management "bolt-ons." Bolt-ons are technology solutions designed to help firms achieve greater efficiency with more general information systems that had less than fully integrated functional capability. Bolt-ons leverage manufacturing schedule and cost data, along with data on sales seasonality, to provide information and recommendations managers can use in supplier selection, negotiation, and contracting. In order for supply chain management bolt-on implementation to be successful, those charged with the implementation need to have a sufficient level of understanding regarding the nature of the data required by the bolt-on (i.e., where to retrieve manufacturing data and how to enable the bolt-on to digest it, where to retrieve sales data, and past contracts). If the wrong source data are connected, or the wrong kind of decision made in support of the bolt-on (e.g., if the implementation team does not truly understand what the firm needs) significant rework on the implementation is likely to be required. Moreover, it is critical for implementation teams to be sensitive to the expectations of the client. However, because implementation teams typically have some members that know more about sales and others that know more about manufacturing, and still others that more about contracting, it is also critical for team members to be sensitive to one another's needs and expectations.</p><p>Given the significant resources associated with their deployment, and the costs associated with the projects in which they were engaged, the ERP implementation teams in the current study were formally staffed and deployed by management. The members of the project teams retain some degree of expertise specialization based on experience. But, all of the members of the teams in our sample are IT employees-so all were "experts," broadly, in the systems requirements necessary to engage the specifications of the projects for which they were deployed. These teams also were essentially standardized with respect to role so that no single member, formally, retained responsibilities that were distinguishable from the other members of the team. Here, it also is critical to note that these ERP implementation teams are not standing teams in general terms. They represent a subset of the firm's IT staff, which become assigned to ERP projects, for a specified duration of time (as we note earlier), and which are then disbanded as new projects emerge.</p><p>The "tasks" for which these implementation teams are responsible may be thought of as emerging in stages across the implementation cycle, with foundational aspects of the project laid down first, and subsequent project-specific elements laid over these elements in a broadly predictable sequence. The members of these teams also operate with a significant degree of functional interdependence, as all aspects of the system are being deployed for the implementation to be effective at the conclusion of the project. Although all of the work being carried out by these teams is executed by individuals, it is executed in an integrative, interdependent way. The tasks engaged by these ERP implementation teams involve hardware and software installations, database and process integration with user interfaces, developing connections to supply chain partner systems, and the design/customization of interfaces to match users and disparate system needs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common method variance</head><p>Given the variables-in-focus in our research model, our design required data to be collected from the same source. Following <ref type="bibr" coords="11,74.38,425.38,195.88,8.80" target="#b71">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003)</ref>, we took several precautions to minimize potential methods bias. First, we assured respondents that their individual responses would be kept confidential, and any reporting of findings would be accomplished in the aggregate. Second, to minimize priming effects, data were collected at multiple points over the course of the project. In most cases, these data collections were separated by several months. Third, following <ref type="bibr" coords="11,85.55,473.40,141.34,8.80" target="#b93">Williams, Cote, and Buckley (1989)</ref>, we used structural equation modeling to explore the extent that common method variance (CMV) potentially influenced our results. Using our sample's individual-level data, we estimated two measurement models-a full measurement model and the identical model with an additional uncorrelated method factor. If the fit of the method and trait model is significantly better than the model without the method factor, then CMV is a potential issue. Fit statistics indicate that the full measurement model fit the data well (X 2 = 3037.19, p = .00, CFI = 0.95, NFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.068). The addition of the methods factor resulted in minor improvement across some indices (X 2 = 1337.89, p = .00, CFI = 0.99, NFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.035). The results from an X 2 difference test indicated that the difference was significant (X 2 diff (42) = 1699.30, p &lt; .0001). To determine the extent of CMV influence, we followed previous conventions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="11,387.38,569.38,117.49,8.80;11,44.96,581.40,23.22,8.80" target="#b18">Direnzo, Greenhaus, &amp; Weer, 2015)</ref> that use the sum of the squared loadings to index the total variance explained by the method factor.

(1989)</ref> and in line with a number of recent studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="11,397.42,605.38,107.44,8.80;11,44.96,617.40,22.70,8.80" target="#b27">Fugate, Prussia, &amp; Kinicki, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,72.00,617.40,175.22,8.80" target="#b46">Kraimer, Shaffer, Harrison, &amp; Ren, 2012)</ref> and considerably less than others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="11,418.97,617.40,85.92,8.80;11,44.96,629.36,68.89,8.80" target="#b3">Baron, Franklin, and Hmieleski, 2013)</ref>.

The purpose of the current study was to build on and extend TM theory by exploring the dispositional and psychological drivers of TMS. Our results provide unique insight regarding how generalized tendencies toward negative or positive experiences impact the extent to which members evaluate their environments as being safe for accepting the inherent interpersonal risks associated with coordinated information processing. The extent that team members are willing and able to participate in the division of labor required for TMS reduces individual members' cognitive burden and increases the collective availability of knowledge and information <ref type="bibr" coords="14,493.23,297.37,28.75,8.80;14,62.02,309.39,21.93,8.80" target="#b51">(Lewis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,86.81,309.39,96.25,8.80" target="#b54">Lewis &amp; Herndon, 2011)</ref>.

Although we find that PA is significantly, positively related to PS, PA was not significantly related to TMS. We also find that NA is significantly, negatively related to both PS and TMS. Finally, we find that group PS is significantly, positively associated with TMS, and mediates the relationship between group NA and TMS.</p><p>This pattern of results is consistent with extant research demonstrating different causal mechanisms associated with NA and PA (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,159.71,417.39,81.66,8.80" target="#b38">Kaplan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,245.09,417.39,153.17,8.80" target="#b57">Lyubomirsky, King, &amp; Diener, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,401.96,417.39,120.01,8.80;14,62.02,429.41,77.56,8.80" target="#b82">Thoresen, Kaplan, Barsky, &amp; de Chermont, 2003)</ref>. That is, NA and PA are not opposite ends of an affective continuum. Instead, NA has its impact on outcomes through the BIS (e.g., avoidance orientation, bias towards risk/negativity), whereas the effects of PA are transmitted through the BAS (e.g., approach orientation, bias towards rewards/positivity). As a transmitter of affectivity, PS is likely to be more closely associated with the BAS than to the BIS. Further, because PS involves assessments of interpersonal risk (not reward), the effects of PA are not carried over to TMS through PS. In fact, PS exhibited no direct relationship with TMS. These results offer insights into the extent to which individual differences at the group level impact the extent that groups develop specialized, credible and well-coordinated expertise <ref type="bibr" coords="14,100.69,513.37,56.10,8.80" target="#b51">(Lewis, 2003)</ref> through learning and interpersonal risk taking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications and extensions</head><p>Given the lack of association between PA and TMS in our study, our strongest results orbit the relationship we uncover between NA and TMS. NA catalyzes selective attention toward-and strong reactivity to-negative environmental and interpersonal information. We contend that in contrast to low NA teams, high NA teams are more likely to spend a disproportionate amount of time focused on members' failings and deficiencies. NA can lead to a psychologically unsafe environment where teams are reluctant to engage in the social exchange of critical task and architectural information undergirding TMS. Members also are unlikely to feel comfortable-or even able-to ask other members for help with work-related tasks with which they have less experience or expertise or to take risks establishing the location of expertise among their group members. On the one hand, high NA teams are likely to be characterized by high levels of anxiety, fear, and caution while on the other by feelings of hostility and irritability. This may lead to an inward focus and skepticism of others' intentions, diminishing information exchange. It will be important for future research to disentangle the role played by the more passive aspects of NA (fear, anxiety, and caution) from its more aggressive aspects (hostility, anger, and distress) and the respect impact of these elements of NA on group level PS and TMS.</p><p>Although our study was focused at the group level, our findings also provide guidance for extant research on dyadic perspectives of PS and the concept of face (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,279.39,173.78,53.18,8.80" target="#b85">Tynan, 2005)</ref>. For example, this research suggests that heightened threat sensitivity may diminish the ease and timeliness with which members communicate self and other potentially face-threatening information <ref type="bibr" coords="15,233.01,197.76,56.07,8.80" target="#b85">(Tynan, 2005)</ref>. Face refers to self and others' image, whereas face saving refers to efforts to avoid harm to one's own or another's face in the presence of threatening circumstances <ref type="bibr" coords="15,44.96,221.80,56.53,8.80" target="#b85">(Tynan, 2005)</ref>.

When faced with the need to communicate facethreatening information, initiators are likely to seek to conserve resources by delaying, distorting, or avoiding unpleasant communications. Consequently, high levels of NA in a team are likely to lead to delays, distortions, or failure to deliver unfavorable information (e.g., manifestations of low PS). The withholding of critical information and open feedback limits members' ability to make accurate or complete assessments regarding which members possess the most relevant expertise for particular group tasks. Moreover, because NA diminishes the attractiveness and increases the threat associated with interpersonal interactions, it also is likely to impede the emergence of the task structures and processes central to effective TMS functioning (e.g., high levels of cognitive interdependence, trust, and coordination- <ref type="bibr" coords="15,123.24,389.78,99.00,8.80" target="#b54">Lewis &amp; Herndon, 2011)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>Results from both laboratory and field research indicate that teams operating a TMS can apply more task-critical knowledge, more effectively coordinate their interactions, and perform better than groups without a TMS (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,476.51,484.00,28.41,8.80;15,44.96,496.08,22.32,8.80" target="#b1">Austin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,70.30,496.08,64.79,8.80" target="#b48">Lee et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,137.99,496.08,51.57,8.80" target="#b51">Lewis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,192.59,496.08,51.57,8.80" target="#b52">Lewis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,247.13,496.08,72.89,8.80" target="#b56">Liang et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,323.04,496.08,65.76,8.80" target="#b62">Moreland, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,391.70,496.08,83.50,8.80" target="#b63">Moreland et al., 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,482.59,496.08,17.85,8.80" target="#b64">Moreland et al., , 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,44.96,508.15,130.33,8.80" target="#b65">Moreland &amp; Myaskovsky, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,178.41,508.15,74.65,8.80" target="#b95">Zhang et al., 2007)</ref>. Managers seeking to stimulate an effective cognitive division of labor through the promotion of positive and rewarding team environments are likely to be frustrated when their efforts fail to generate an operative TMS. Instead of offering rewards and incentives to foster TMS, managers should consider reducing perceived risks associated with learning-oriented behaviors such as declaring expertise, experimentation, or asking for help.</p><p>Training focused on educating managers regarding the functional distinctions between NA and PA can play an important role here. Specifically, research reveals that NA and PA, which reflect two separate continua <ref type="bibr" coords="15,473.05,580.66,31.84,8.80;15,44.96,592.80,49.57,8.80" target="#b38">(Kaplan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,98.42,592.80,107.06,8.80" target="#b57">Lyubomirsky et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,209.37,592.80,89.13,8.80" target="#b82">Thoresen et al., 2003)</ref>, may help managers more effectively target their environmental shaping initiatives. Interpersonal risk-taking and learning may be motivated by reduced hostility, fear, and guilt (i.e., NA) rather than the promotion of enthusiasm, excitement, and pride (i.e., PA). For example, research <ref type="bibr" coords="15,72.96,629.08,96.57,8.80" target="#b11">(Carrington et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,172.41,629.08,127.89,8.80" target="#b68">Peters, Benson, &amp; Porter, 1977)</ref> suggests that the application of within-work mediation procedures may improve employees' subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" coords="15,307.50,641.16,57.09,8.80" target="#b17">(Diener, 2000)</ref>, diminishing correlates of NA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and directions for future research</head><p>Although the current study has several strengths, it is important to consider limitations of our study design that impact our ability to draw definitive inferences from our results. First, our model rests on the expectation that favorable perceptions of PS support learning behaviors that stimulate specialized, credible, and coordinated expertise. The value of this contribution is mitigated by the fact that we assumed (i.e., in accordance with assumptions in the TMS domain-Lewis &amp; Herndon, 2011) the presence of learning but did not capture actual learning behavior. It will be important for future research to explicitly capture the learning behaviors TMS researchers broadly assume account for TMS, such as help giving and seeking, expression of voice, and experimentation. Second, given conceptual similarities in the nature of the constructs we examine (i.e., both TMS and PS are cognitive emergent states), it will be important for future research to incorporate a broader set of antecedent factors. Third, we employed a lagged design that incorporated a conceptually coherent data collection, with our independent variable (group affectivity) collected prior to our mediator (PS) and dependent variable (TMS). However, as we did not incorporate a longitudinal design encompassing change over time, our data do not allow us to draw definitive causal inferences regarding the relationships between affectivity, PS, and TMS. Moreover, TMS is likely subject to dynamism; the decision to engage in transactive processing with another is driven by one's momentary perceptions of the location, content, value, cost, and accessibility of another's expertise. These factors are dynamic, such that once a team member learns something, gains a new skill, makes a mistake, and so on; other members of the team need to transfer this learning by updating their respective cognitive directories as well as the group's overall directory. In this way, a team may have a shared understanding of "who knows what" at one moment in time, but fail to transfer learning through directory updating, leading to a subsequent divergence in group member's "shared" understanding. It will be important for future research to examine patterns of group affectivity, PS, and TMS over time to evaluate these relationships. Future research also should explore variables representing both risks and rewards as potential mediators of NA and PA on TMS.</p><p>Finally, although our study adopted a compositional approach by taking individual level perceptions and aggregating them to the group level, this approach does not provide guidance regarding the impact of perceptual dispersion among members of a group. For example, consider a four-person group in which one member is high in NA, while the other three members are low in NA. Aggregation of these individual perceptions to the group level might suggest that the group on average is a "low-NA" group and is likely to be experienced as less threatening and subsequently better positioned to develop TMS. However, our theory suggests that because of heightened sensitivity to risk and threat, the high NA member is likely to have a less accurate and complete understanding of the content, location, and accessibility of the other three members' expertise-a condition that can potentially retard the development of TMS. Specifically, a strong TMS could be present among the three low NA members but could be weak or non-existent between the high NA member and each of the three NA members, respectively. Although such possibilities are outside of the scope of the current study, we encourage future research to account for such perceptual differences by exploring the affectivity, PS, and TMS pathways from a multi-level, social network perspective. Indeed, recent research has begun to explore PS using such a lens <ref type="bibr" coords="16,80.28,497.38,84.13,8.80" target="#b77">(Roussin et al., 2014)</ref> and can provide a useful framework for extending ideas we advance in the current study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Although a great deal of research has focused on the performance consequences of TMS <ref type="bibr" coords="16,418.68,569.38,103.32,8.80" target="#b54">(Lewis &amp; Herndon, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,62.02,581.40,85.04,8.80" target="#b75">Ren &amp; Argote, 2011)</ref>, less attention has been devoted to TMS antecedents. Moreover, previous research has provided little guidance on the effects of interpersonal risk perceptions and learning on groups' TMS. Our study advances a framework that incorporates group level dispositional affectivity and PS as precursors to TMS. We demonstrate that TMS is reliant not only on the predominant theme of TMS regarding knowledge of "who knows what," but also a willingness to be vulnerable to negative interpersonal consequences stemming from engaging in the types of behaviors that allow one to learn "who knows what" and continuously monitor "who may have recently learned what." Moreover, members' experience of NA and PA influence the extent to which they evaluate and subsequently approach or avoid such interpersonal risks. Because TMS depends on members' willingness to engage in these kinds of risky exchanges, understanding the dispositional, social, and psychological drivers of these patterns of information exchange contributes to our understanding of TMS antecedents.</p></div>
