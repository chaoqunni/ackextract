<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>Consumers can experience relatively low prices with the dramatic diffusion of online shopping even with customized products, which are commonly more expensive than regular products, due to unique functions of customized product order processes in online environments. This paper investigates how two psychological antecedents, (1) need for uniqueness and (2) status aspiration, can influence consumers' attitude with regard to forming procedures toward e-customized products and how perceived risk, another psychological factor, on purchasing e-customized products plays a role of moderating factor. A self-administered online survey of 321 Japanese consumers is conducted to examine a proposed conceptual model with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The analysis using results indicates that the need for uniqueness directly impacts on attitude toward e-customized products while it mediates the effect of status aspiration. A multi-group analysis to test a moderating effect of the perceived risk on purchasing e-customized products highlights the significant effects of psychological factors. The result also provides potential guidelines to e-tailors on possibility of segmenting markets as well as promoting their customized products using these psychological criteria of their target consumers.</p></div>

While traditional customization has been an important part of consumer and retailing research for decades, there seems to be no clear conceptual boundaries with online customization for products (i.e., e-customization) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,119.91,575.88,151.00,7.54" target="#b20">(Duray, Ward, Milligan, &amp; Berry, 2000)</ref> although empirical studies have dealt with issues of concerns of online customization to manufacturers and retailers such as customization levels, systems, enabling technologies, and process methodologies <ref type="bibr" coords="1,33.74,617.72,147.48,7.54" target="#b60">(Silveira, Borenstein, &amp; Fogliatto, 2001)</ref>, and online customization for web contents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,100.98,628.16,88.30,7.54" target="#b27">(Guo &amp; Salvendy, 2009)</ref>. Despite the fact that ecustomization processes during online purchasing may require that they be educated about related skills for instance use of the Internet as well as have relevant knowledge about the product, still a growing number of customers seek for e-customized products. For example, when trying to purchase an e-customized laptop computer on Dell.com, customers should not only be accustomed to using the Internet, but also need to obtain knowledge to choose relevant features based on basic computer knowledge such as its operating system, hard drives, types of chips and main board, and so forth. Given that much research has concentrated on suppliers' perspectives on technology, there is a scarcity of research that deals with consumers' internal psychological properties that shape attitudes toward purchasing of e-customized products. The researchers for this study sense that factors fabricated due to the different medium, the Internet vs. in person, between traditional customization product order process and e-customized order product process must be one of the critical variables that would impact on attitude toward e-customized products and purchasing intention of e-customized products.</p><p>For online e-customized product shopping, consumers more likely seek for personalized search products than experience products <ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.72,628.18,111.82,7.54" target="#b43">(Moon, Chadee, &amp; Tikoo, 2008)</ref> and sense higher benefits on purchasing customized products than standardized products when they have better perception and understanding into their own preferences <ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.72,659.59,115.17,7.54" target="#b24">(Franke, Keinz, &amp; Steger, 2009)</ref>, and they are able to express their preferences with higher product involvement.</p><p>Regardless of the complicated process and more expensive price, nonetheless, there is significant demand for customized products due to the unique characteristics of the products such as uniqueness <ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.71,711.92,122.96,7.54" target="#b12">(Chan, Berger, &amp; Van Boven, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,426.88,711.92,105.86,7.54" target="#b35">Kastanakis &amp; Balabanis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,534.86,711.92,17.85,7.54;2,42.52,57.81,43.57,7.54" target="#b68">Zhan &amp; He, 2012)</ref> or reflecting image/status <ref type="bibr" coords="2,183.16,57.81,110.40,7.54" target="#b35">(Kastanakis &amp; Balabanis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,68.24,64.38,7.54" target="#b43">Moon et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,108.90,68.24,167.73,7.54" target="#b65">Wiedmann, Hennigs, Varelmann, &amp; Reeh, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Cutting edge online technologies are able to aid retailers to support personalized e-customized products' sales and provide these products to their customers better than ever with configuration tools for both mass and pure customization.

Assuming that taking a risk is one of the Internet's natural characteristics, it is also important to consider the effect of perceived risk on how consumers form their attitude toward e-customized products. With the feasible competitive advantage of e-customization, it is important to investigate which factors lead consumers to shop for e-customized even though customers are likely to confront some barriers such as a higher price, complicated processes, or uncertainty of receiving the right products and risk of online shopping itself.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Structural equations analysis</head><p>Prior to the structural equation analysis, the basic descriptive analysis revealed that the sample confirmed the assumptions of normality, collinearity, and outliers' presence. In addition to the descriptive analysis, an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the indicators are loaded strongly on the designated constructs. Most of the constructs had factor loading greater than 0.70 and there was no indication of cross loading factors. As there was no single recommended measure of fit for SEM, a variety of model fit measures were applied to determine the model's appropriateness. Provided in <ref type="table" coords="4,355.15,549.53,25.23,7.54" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, the χ 2 /df value for this model was 2.432, which is below the generally desired cut-off value of 3.0. Additionally, in terms of Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) and Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI), the values in this model indicated 0.932 and 0.900 respectively, displaying greater than the satisfactory level of 0.9 for the GFI and 0.8 for AGFI. However, with regard to Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) the fit index was 0.067, which is below the recommended cut-off level of 0.08. Still with these multiple fit indices indicating a reasonable fit for this model, the results of the structural model analysis can be considered to show a good fit of the proposed model to the data.</p><p>In terms of the basic model, the relationship between need for uniqueness (NU) and attitude toward e-customized products (AeCP) is statistically significant (β = 0.706; t-value = 8.715), as hypothesized. With regard to the relations connected to status aspiration (SA), the relationship with NU is significant (β = 0.025; t-value = 7.362); however, its influence on attitudes toward e-customized products is not significant (β = 0.025), with a 0.05 significance level and a relatively low t-value of 0.411. Lastly, AeCP had a strong and significant impact (β = 1.592; t-value = 13.558) on purchasing intention on e-customized products (PIeCP).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and implications</head><p>With the dramatic diffusion of the Internet, consumers can purchase e-customized products within a reasonable time frame at a relatively reasonable price. At the same time, suppliers can provide e-customized products with relatively low costs while satisfying consumers' needs and be able to keep track on existing customers' trends and needs through online tools which also helps choose future markets. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,336.19,390.95,106.06,7.54" target="#b34">Kaplan and Haenlein (2006)</ref> defined e-customization as a strategy that creates value through interactions between suppliers and consumers and companies provide customized products to differentiate their products and services and to gain customer loyalty while generating sales lead <ref type="bibr" coords="5,403.30,432.80,50.90,7.54">(Hogue, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Under the development of e-customization, much research has been done on building efficient e-customization processes for suppliers. Since there is scarcity of e-customization research exploring cognitive approaches to consumers' e-customized product consumption, this research attempted to investigate meaningful psychological constructs (i.e. needs for uniqueness and status aspiration), which were anticipated to play a role in consumers' purchase of e-customized products. Ultimately, scarcity and uniqueness have been necessary reflecting conspicuous and status or prestige seeking consumption. The products that consumers utilize to distinguish themselves may be scarce and unique enough to be distinguishable from other standardized mass products. Consumers' desire for uniqueness can be fulfilled with consuming e-customized products and in these days, however, consumers NU: needs for uniqueness; SA: status aspiration; ACP: attitude on e-customized products; PIeCP: purchasing intention on e-customized products; PR: perceived risk on customized products. **Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed). no longer have to rely on expensive prestige brands to acquire unique and scarce products.</p><p>According to the results presented in the previous section, it appears that the need for uniqueness has a significant influence on customers' attitudes toward e-customized products, while status aspiration has a limited influence on customers' attitudes toward e-customized products, and its effect is mediated by the need for uniqueness.</p><p>When it comes to the moderating effect of perceived risk, consumers perceiving a higher level of risk for purchasing products on the Internet are more likely depending on psychological needs when forming attitudes toward e-customized products than consumers with a lower level of perceived risk. On the other hand, people who perceive a lower level of risk for online purchases tend to engage in a strong relationship between attitudes and purchase intention toward e-customized products. This indicates that people who perceive a high risk are not likely to purchase e-customized products even when they have positive attitudes toward e-customized products. In contrast, for people with a low purchase risk to purchase e-customized products on the Internet, their positive attitudes toward e-customized products may directly associate with purchase behavior of e-customized products.</p><p>This research showed that the need for uniqueness and the status aspiration have a significant impact on forming favorable attitudes toward e-customized products. By enlightening the psychological antecedents of adoption of e-customization products, this study fills up the deficiency of the psychological approaches related to e-customization. This psychological approach is crucial to help marketers construct marketing strategies including segmentation defining their target consumers. More recently, marketers have put more importance on psychological segmentation criteria such as motivation, attitudes, perceptions, and personality rather than on demographic characteristics. Thus, the authors urge the researchers to consider the influences of psychological factors on e-customized products or services which need to be investigated from consumers' perspectives. Besides consumers' perception toward online shopping becoming a significant psychological factor, the moderating role of perceived risk on shopping on the Internet suggests that researchers and practitioners need to learn to decrease consumers' perceived risk by presenting the evidences of strong security controls of their websites and designing user-friendly websites which should be emphasized especially dealing with e-customized products as it adds one more risk issue, receiving incorrect products. Online marketers need to enhance ease of ordering and build trustworthy relationships with consumers by adopting effective privacy and security policies on the way of earning their royalty. Given the amount of explanatory power in predicting purchasing intention of e-customized products with two psychological antecedents, the utility of the model seems promising as the model evolves and further develops.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Limitations and future research</head><p>To our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine consumers' psychological antecedents for purchasing e-customized products on the Internet at the same time proposing a model testing the psychological antecedents.</p><p>First, this study proposes the model tested using a Japanese sample group which considered a less individualistic but a collectivism country <ref type="bibr" coords="6,340.61,318.48,129.31,7.54" target="#b0">(Abe, Bagozzi, &amp; Sadarangani, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,471.85,318.48,64.40,7.54" target="#b43">Moon et al., 2008)</ref>; however, the model needs to be reassessed using additional samples to generalize the findings on more individualistic countries such as USA. It is also possible that this sample coming from Japan could have limited the ability to detect some findings although there is evidence that individual difference, rather than cultural difference determines the extent (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="6,413.80,381.25,130.03,7.54" target="#b64">Suh, Diener, Oishi, &amp; Triandis, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The second limitation of this study is the scenario using only shoes and clothing, considered relatively low cost and tangible products. Whether the products are customized or standardized, the price difference could be minimal and receiving incorrect products would not be a big problem to many people. Studies testing this model using different products in different price ranges and for different companies (with high royalty vs. low royalty) need to be done.</p><p>Another limitation of this study was the data collection method which can be subject to errors; it was collected through selfadministered questionnaires measuring customers' perception and intention as oppose to collection of their actual purchasing behavior. As an effort to minimize large errors of survey method nature, the researchers presented scenarios for participants to imitate a real life purchasing behavior.</p><p>The fourth limitation is using a relatively homogenous sample. The researchers attempted to target a wide range of age groups, but most of the participants were young university students than other associates of the universities. However, the purpose of this study was accomplished because to test a theory driven model, the best sample is a homogenous sample <ref type="bibr" coords="6,432.44,590.39,73.18,7.54" target="#b30">(Huang et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,508.53,590.39,49.24,7.54" target="#b45">Mullen, 1995)</ref>. The objective of this study was not to test Japanese consumers' e-customization product consumption, but testing the proposed model, using a sample that, on a regular basis, purchases customized products online.</p><p>Future studies need to be done testing this proposed model using different types of products, and applying this study broadly, crosscultural effects on e-customized products need to be examined with different samples from different regions and cultures as well as for different occupations and income levels. Specifically, moderating effects of perceived risk on e-shopping in a relationship with those two psychological factors need more research as consumers in individualism countries are predicted to purchase more e-customized products and willing to pay more than consumers in collectivistic countries <ref type="bibr" coords="6,536.86,726.41,24.70,7.54;6,310.51,736.90,40.96,7.54" target="#b43">(Moon et al., 2008)</ref>.
