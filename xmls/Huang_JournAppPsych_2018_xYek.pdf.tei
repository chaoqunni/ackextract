<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Departing from past research on managers' responses to employee voice, we propose and examine a nonlinear linkage between promotive/prohibitive voice and managers' evaluations of voicers (i.e., manager-rated voicers' promotability and overall performance). Drawing from social persuasion theory, we theorize that managers tend to give more positive evaluations to employees who engage in a moderate frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice than those who either rarely speak up or speak up very frequently. In Study 1, based on a sample from a Chinese bank, we found that leader-member exchange quality (LMX) moderated the inverted U-shaped linkage of prohibitive voice with manager-rated promotability of voicers, whereas the frequency of promotive voice was not related to promotability, irrespective of levels of LMX. In Study 2, using employee-reported voice frequency, rather than the manager-rated measures adopted in Study 1, we largely replicated the main findings of Study 1 based on a sample from an information technology firm in the United States. In Study 3, using another U.S. sample, from a financial services firm, we found that manager-perceived voice constructiveness mediated the curvilinear interactive effect of prohibitive voice (rather than promotive voice) and LMX on managers' evaluations of employees' overall performance.</p></div>

It remains undetermined, however, whether employees engaging in such voice behavior tend to receive favorable or unfavorable responses from managers.

Although these meta-analytic findings are enlightening, recent voice research has suggested that managers' responses to employee voice are determined not only by the content of voice (e.g., messages with or without a solution), but also by the characteristics of voicers (e.g., expertise of voicers) and the voicing context (e.g., organizational norms; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,409.33,512.22,132.46,7.91;1,306.00,523.49,46.35,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting, Maynes, Podsakoff, &amp; Podsakoff, 2012)</ref>.

Rather, we propose employees' frequency of voicing (an observable voicer characteristic) and their leader-member exchange quality with their supervisors (LMX, a relational context) as two salient variables that regulate the effects of promotive voice and prohibitive voice on managers' evaluations.</p><p>Specifically, frequency of voice, defined as how often an employee takes the initiative to raise various work-related issues to his or her immediate supervisor, ranging from never doing it to voicing very frequently, signals a salient characteristic of voicers: the extent to which they make efforts to initiate changes that may benefit the organization. We propose that frequency of promotive and prohibitive voice has an inverted U-shaped relationship, rather than a linear relationship, with managers' evaluations. This is because managers tend to appreciate and reward employees who exhibit a moderate level of challenging voice more than those who show either few such initiatives or overly persistent efforts to challenge the status quo (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.30,198.04,125.74,7.91;2,48.00,209.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b21">Fuller, Marler, Hester, &amp; Otondo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.17,209.04,118.94,7.91" target="#b25">Grant, Parker, &amp; Collins, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,194.78,209.04,93.25,7.91;2,48.00,220.04,66.36,7.91">Lam, Rees, Levesque, &amp; Ornstein, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,116.92,220.04,135.49,7.91" target="#b50">Milliken, Morrison, &amp; Hewlin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.97,220.04,33.07,7.91;2,48.00,231.04,47.77,7.91" target="#b60">Schilit &amp; Locke, 1982)</ref>.

By proposing a nonlinear effect of voice frequency on managers' evaluations, we offer a new way to address the mixed findings regarding the effects of challenging voice on managers' evaluations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,167.39,308.04,51.35,7.91" target="#b7">(Burris, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.85,308.04,66.20,7.91;2,48.00,319.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b9">Chamberlin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,70.51,319.04,117.75,7.91" target="#b61">Seibert, Kraimer, &amp; Crant, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.27,319.04,97.76,7.91" target="#b72">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,330.04,133.59,7.91" target="#b75">Whiting, Podsakoff, &amp; Pierce, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, following social persuasion theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,227.99,341.04,60.06,7.91;2,48.00,352.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b5">(Bri√±ol &amp; Petty, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,70.64,352.04,85.05,7.91" target="#b49">Menon &amp; Blount, 2003)</ref>, we cast LMX as a salient relational context that exerts an overriding influence on managers' responses to promotive/prohibitive voice.

Our model thus challenges the idea that challenging voice, in general, and prohibitive voice, in particular, results in managers' less favorable evaluations, especially for outgroup employees <ref type="bibr" coords="2,259.56,462.04,28.49,7.91;2,48.00,473.04,60.25,7.91" target="#b49">(Menon &amp; Blount, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,111.24,473.04,75.35,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the cognition in persuasion model, an extension of social persuasion theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,141.46,495.03,67.89,7.91" target="#b1">(Albarrac√≠n, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.01,495.03,75.04,7.91;2,48.00,506.03,20.50,7.91" target="#b2">Albarrac√≠n &amp; Wyer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,71.91,506.03,63.08,7.91" target="#b26">Hart et al., 2009)</ref>, posits that cognitive processes, such as message recipients' cognitive assessments of the beneficial outcomes of messages, play a central role in explaining how various social persuasion factors (e.g., source, content, and context characteristics) jointly influence receivers' responses to persuasion.</p><p>Drawing from this theory, we propose and examine the mediating role of manager-perceived voice constructiveness, defined as the extent to which managers regard the voiced issues as making positive contributions to the organization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,456.29,110.03,76.14,7.91" target="#b74">(Whiting et al., 2012)</ref>.

In line with this reasoning, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,397.29,385.04,96.90,7.91">Chamberlin et al.'s (2017)</ref> meta-analytic study demonstrated that when the content of challenging voice is framed as expressing opportunities to enhance organizational functioning by doing new things in new ways in the future (i.e., promotive voice; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,372.18,429.04,68.64,7.91" target="#b40">Liang et al., 2012)</ref>, managers tend to appraise voicers' overall performance more favorably.

Accumulated evidence in the social persuasion research has suggested, however, that message recipients' assessments of messages' beneficial outcomes and their subsequent reactions are affected not only by the content, but also by source and context characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="3,104.43,143.04,62.06,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1985)</ref>. In a seminal work on social persuasion, for example, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,144.01,154.04,144.04,7.91" target="#b57">Petty, Cacioppo, and Goldman (1981)</ref> showed that the content of the message (e.g., strength of arguments) gave way to the source characteristic (e.g., expert status) in influencing message recipients' judgments of the quality of the message within the context of low thinking, suggesting that peripheral cues can play an important role in shaping social persuasion processes. Extending this idea to the voice context, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,249.94,220.04,38.11,7.91;3,48.00,231.04,36.22,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting et al. (2012)</ref> proposed specific conditions that influence managers' evaluations of the voice and the voicers. Using a series of laboratory studies, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,94.66,253.04,76.11,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting et al. (2012)</ref> demonstrated, for example, that source, message, and context characteristics independently influence managers' assessments of the voiced issues and thus their evaluations of voicers' overall performance.</p><p>Because of the nature of laboratory studies, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.56,297.04,59.49,7.91;3,48.00,308.04,23.99,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting et al.'s (2012)</ref> model is particularly relevant to managers' reactions to a single "incident" of voice. In reality, however, challenging voice is not an one-off endeavor. Employees may voice out challenging issues and interact with their supervisors over a relatively long period of time. Hence, managers' evaluations of voicing employees are shaped not only by how employees frame their voice (promotive vs. prohibitive), but also by employees' habit of voice behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="3,85.55,385.04,75.72,7.91">(Lam et al., in press)</ref> and by employees' ongoing social interactions with their supervisors <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.53,396.04,94.39,7.91" target="#b16">(Dutton &amp; Ashford, 1993)</ref>. We therefore propose that, in organizational settings, the effects of promotive and prohibitive voice on managers' evaluations may not follow a linear pattern, as depicted in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,190.33,429.04,97.71,7.91">Chamberlin et al.'s (2017)</ref> study but instead are influenced by voicers' frequency of voicing that reflects important characteristics of voicers and their LMX quality with managers, which captures a salient voicing context at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency and Content of Challenging Voice</head><p>In the workplace, some employees may remain silent; some may speak up occasionally; others may frequently voice up issues that challenge the status quo . Prior research has suggested that individual characteristics, such as work experience, conscientiousness, and proactive personality, predict how often employees speak up at work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.03,572.04,95.99,7.91" target="#b39">(Li, Liang, &amp; Crant, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,583.04,151.82,7.91" target="#b64">Thomas, Whitman, &amp; Viswesvaran, 2010)</ref>. In a recent paper, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,271.55,583.04,16.50,7.91;3,48.00,594.04,55.85,7.91">Lam et al. (in press)</ref> developed a theoretical framework to depict how employees may form stable "habits" of voicing. They argued that some individuals may lack situational awareness and controllability and are concerned about efficiency. As a result, these individuals tend to develop a "habit" of voicing and engage in voice behaviors more frequently than others. According to social persuasion theory, certain characteristics of message senders can communicate important cues that trigger message recipients' judgmental shortcuts or heuristics of processing the messages, determine message recipients' favorable or unfavorable thinking about the messages, or serve as arguments for or against the persuasive attempts <ref type="bibr" coords="3,80.75,715.04,81.01,7.91" target="#b5">(Bri√±ol &amp; Petty, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,164.02,715.04,88.38,7.91" target="#b55">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986)</ref>. Thus, in line with this theory, we regard frequency of voice as an easy-toobserve characteristic of voicers that may provide salient peripheral cues, shaping managers' assessments of promotive and prohibitive voice. We anticipate that low, moderate, and high frequency levels may signal qualitatively different characteristics of the voicer, causing an inverted U-shaped relationship between the frequency of promotive and prohibitive voice and managers' evaluations of the voicing employee.</p><p>Compared to employees exhibiting moderate frequencies of promotive/prohibitive voice, a low frequency may signal to managers that the voicing employees are exerting relatively little effort to initiate changes and challenge the status quo to improve the organization's functioning.

This is because managers tend to degrade employees who do not take the initiative to engage in their work and contribute to the organization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,512.14,275.04,33.90,7.91;3,306.00,286.03,36.53,7.91" target="#b21">(Fuller et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,347.56,286.03,72.45,7.91" target="#b25">Grant et al., 2009)</ref>. Managers may thus form less favorable assessments of the voiced issues from employees with low voice frequency and may be less likely to reward their voice behavior with positive evaluations.</p><p>A moderate frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice may inform managers that the voicing employees are exerting relatively more effort to initiate changes and challenge the status quo for the organization than those who rarely voice up.

Instead of predicting a linear and stronger positive effect of promotive/prohibitive voice on managers' evaluations, we suggest that managers may not view promotive/prohibitive voice positively at high frequencies. Rather, this informative characteristic of voicing employees might cause managers to form unfavorable judgments of voiced issues from these employees. This is because managers tend to resist employees who persistently and frequently challenge the status quo, and thus they may devalue their voice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,371.73,605.03,80.50,7.91" target="#b50">Milliken et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,456.06,605.03,86.12,7.91" target="#b60">Schilit &amp; Locke, 1982)</ref>.

This is because managers may think that these employees have not given sufficient thought to the voiced issues, and thus they may see the employees' voice as less valuable and constructive. Hence, high frequency of voice provides a salient cue that might exert a negative influence on managers' assessments of challenging voice from these employees and thus their evaluations of the voicers, irrespective of the voiced content.

In other words, in high LMX contexts, regardless whether these ingroup subordinates engage in low or high frequencies of challenging voice and regardless whether the content is promotive or prohibitive, managers tend to view their voiced issues in a positive light and thus reward them with more favorable evaluations.</p><p>By contrast, in low LMX relationships, formal hierarchical status is rigidly emphasized, supervisors and subordinates keep a power distance from each other, and supervisors treat subordinates as outgroup members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,405.25,462.78,65.01,7.91" target="#b41">Liden et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,472.27,462.78,73.76,7.91;4,306.00,473.79,19.37,7.91" target="#b69">Uhl-Bien &amp; Maslyn, 2003)</ref>.

Therefore, in low LMX dyads, promotive/prohibitive voice may be positively associated with managers' evaluations of voicers at low-to-moderate frequency levels. Yet, managers may not tolerate a high frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice from these outgroup members. Very frequent attempts to challenge the status quo from outgroup members may induce stronger resistance from managers and may give managers the impression that the voicers put insufficient effort into considering the voiced issues, causing managers to dismiss the potentially beneficial outcomes of voice from these outgroup members. As a result, managers are less likely to reward outgroup members who voice very frequently by giving them positive evaluations. In short, we anticipate that in low LMX dyads, there is a salient inverted U-shape relationship between the frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice and managers' evaluations of voicing employees.

We then contended that because of strong ingroup favoritism, high LMX may have an overriding positive influence on managers' evaluations of voicers, irrespective of frequency levels and voice contents (Hypotheses 2a and 2b). In high LMX dyads, even for employees who engage in prohibitive voice behavior frequently, managers may view their voice in the same positive light as they view promotive voice. Following this logic, at high frequency levels, high LMX forms a powerful relational context that buffers the strong negative effects of prohibitive voice on managers' evaluations. By contrast, as managers are more receptive to promotive voice even when it is voiced very frequently, the buffering effect of LMX for promotive voice may be relatively weaker. We therefore predict that the moderating effect of LMX may be stronger for prohibitive voice than for promotive voice. Taken together, we hypothesize, Hypothesis 2c: The moderating effect of LMX on the curvilinear link between prohibitive voice and managers' evaluations is stronger than that between promotive voice and managers' evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Mediating Role of Manager-Perceived Voice Constructiveness</head><p>Central to our arguments is the idea that voice frequency, voice content, and LMX may jointly shape managers' cognitive assessments of voiced issues and that such cognitive assessments translate into how managers evaluate employees. In this section, we delve further into this cognitive process. Indeed, the recent development of social persuasion theory has highlighted the critical role of cognitive processes underlying the effects of different types of persuasion information on message recipients' attitude formation and change <ref type="bibr" coords="5,91.51,583.04,89.64,7.91" target="#b4">(Bohner &amp; Dickel, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,187.53,583.04,64.99,7.91" target="#b1">Albarrac√≠n (2002)</ref> proposed the cognition in persuasion model, an extension of social persuasion theory, to argue that message characteristics (e.g., voice content) and peripheral information cues (e.g., voicer characteristics and voicing context) tend to jointly affect message recipients' assessments of the messages' beneficial outcomes, which form an important basis for their favorable or unfavorable reactions to persuasion. For instance, in their seminal work on cognitive processes of social persuasion, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,152.41,671.04,104.98,7.91" target="#b2">Albarrac√≠n and Wyer (2001)</ref> demonstrated that although message characteristics, such as the strength of arguments, tend to induce message receivers' positive assessments of the messages' personal and social benefits, persuasion context (e.g., presence or absence of distraction) can alter these assessments, which in turn influence their subsequent behavioral reactions (i.e., accepting the messages or not).</p><p>Following the same line of reasoning as that of the cognition in persuasion model, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,376.88,110.04,80.20,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting et al.

We thus posit that the frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice and LMX should interact to generate managers' judgments either for or against the constructiveness of voiced issues. When challenging voice occurs in dyads with high LMX, such a favorable relational context is likely to cause managers to judge their ingroup employees' voice as constructive, irrespective of its frequency level and content. By contrast, in low LMX dyads, we anticipate that supervisors' judgments of voice constructiveness from outgroup members is shaped by information cues drawn from subordinates' voice frequency and how they frame the content. Hence, following our earlier arguments, in low LMX contexts, we expect an inverted U-shaped relationship between frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice and manager-assessed voice constructiveness. Taken together, we expect similar quadratic-by-linear interactive effects of promotive/prohibitive voice frequency and LMX on managerperceived voice constructiveness as those on managers' evaluations, as we predicted in Hypotheses 2a to 2c. We also expect that, at high frequency levels, LMX may play a more important role in buffering the negative effect of prohibitive voice than that of promotive voice on managers' judgments of the beneficial outcomes of voiced issues.</p><p>Hypothesis 3a: LMX moderates the curvilinear link between the frequency of promotive voice and manager-perceived voice constructiveness, in that the positive relationship between promotive voice and voice constructiveness is more likely to become negative at high frequencies of voice in low LMX dyads than in high LMX dyads.</p><p>Hypothesis 3b: LMX moderates the curvilinear link between the frequency of prohibitive voice and manager-perceived voice constructiveness, in that the positive relationship between prohibitive voice and voice constructiveness is more likely to become negative at high frequencies of voice in low LMX dyads than in high LMX dyads.</p></div>

In Study 2, to address potential for common source bias (i.e., voice and managers' evaluations were all rated by managers) and the cross-cultural generalizability of our model, we replicated Study 1 by asking employees rather than supervisors to report promotive/prohibitive voice frequencies and by using a sample collected from the United States. In Study 3, using another U.S. sample, we examined the complete model by testing the mediating role of voice constructiveness. In the voice literature, managerial evaluations of voicing employees have been widely used to reflect the extent to which managers reward voice behaviors.

We conducted Study 1 in a stateowned commercial bank in a northern city of China. 1 This study received approval from the ethics committee with the project code 592913 (Back Stabbing and Supervisory Retaliation: Consequences of Voice) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Respondents were front-line employees and their supervising managers from the retail banking and the counter service in different branches of the bank. Their main job responsibility was to provide customers with financial services, such as transactional accounts, personal loans, and mortgages. HR managers of the bank helped us invite all employees and immediate supervisors from 31 branches to participate in our survey. And all these employees and supervisors were informed that participation was voluntary and confidentiality was ensured. Each supervisor supervised three to seven employees. The last author and his assistants conducted the pencil and paper surveys in each branch in two time waves. At Time 1, supervising managers were asked to report employees' promotive voice and prohibitive voice, and employees were asked to rate LMX with their supervising managers. We also collected data on the control variables at Time 1. When we executed the surveys during working hours, subordinates were asked to gather in a meeting room in groups. They received a questionnaire, a return envelope, and a letter of introduction. Their immediate supervisors were asked to answer a separate questionnaire in another meeting room. To ensure confidentiality, respondents were instructed to seal the completed questionnaires in the return envelopes and return them directly to the researchers on site. At Time 2, 3 months later, managers were asked to evaluate employees' promotability.</p><p>We distributed surveys to 164 employees and 31 supervising managers. The final sample consisted of 147 employees and 31 managers. The effective response rates were approximately 90% for employees and 100% for managers. For the employee sample, 39.6% were male, and 95.9% had received a college education or above. The mean age and organizational tenure were 27.7 years and 3 years, respectively. For the manager sample, 33.6% were male, and 93.2% had received a college education or above. The mean age and organizational tenure were 35.3 years and 6.6 years, respectively.</p><p>Measures. All measures used in this study were developed originally in English. These measures were translated into Chinese and back-translated into English by bilingual experts. The backtranslated English version was compared with the original English version for equivalence and agreement <ref type="bibr" coords="6,468.32,369.54,77.74,7.91;6,306.00,380.79,63.63,7.91" target="#b6">(Brislin, Lonner, &amp; Thorndike, 1973)</ref>. Promotive voice and prohibitive voice were each measured using a five-item, 7-point scale developed by <ref type="bibr" coords="6,525.05,392.04,21.00,7.91;6,306.00,403.29,43.62,7.91" target="#b40">Liang et al.

Subordinates assessed LMX using the 5-point LMX-7 scale <ref type="bibr" coords="6,510.72,470.72,35.32,7.91;6,306.00,481.96,57.77,7.91" target="#b24">(Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995)</ref>. A sample item is, "How would you characterize your working relationship with your leader?" (1 œ≠ extremely ineffective, 5 œ≠ extremely effective; ‚ê£ œ≠ .91). In Study 1, we captured managers' evaluations of voicing employees in the form of manager-rated promotability of the employees. We assessed promotability using a three-item, seven-point scale adapted from Burris (2012; 1 œ≠ strongly disagree, 7 œ≠ strongly agree; ‚ê£ œ≠ .81). We used two items directly from Burris's measure ("If a position were available, I would recommend this person for a promotion" and "If this person was promoted, I would expect him to perform in his new position"). Because the third item could not fully capture the construct of promotability ("How would you rate this person's performance based on what you know"), we replaced this third item using a modified one in Chinese. This modified item now reads, "This employee has greater potential to be promoted in the future."</p><p>1 The data presented in this study were part of a broader data collection effort.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Before testing our hypotheses, we performed a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to examine the measurement model, which included promotive voice, prohibitive voice, LMX, and promotability. Results suggested that the four-factor measurement model yielded a better model fit (comparative fit index [CFI] œ≠ .98, incremental fit index [IFI] œ≠ .98, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] œ≠ .98, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] œ≠ .05) than the three-factor model that combined both types of voice into one factor (CFI œ≠ .89, IFI œ≠ .89, TLI œ≠ .88, RMSEA œ≠ .11), with a significant chi-square difference (‚å¨ 2 (3) œ≠ 273.91); or the two-factor model with two types of voice as one factor, and LMX and promotability combined as the other factor (CFI œ≠ .78, IFI œ≠ .78, TLI œ≠ .75, RMSEA œ≠ .16; ‚å¨ 2 (5) œ≠ 518.38); or finally, the single-factor model (CFI œ≠ .53, IFI œ≠ .54, TLI œ≠ .47, RMSEA œ≠ .24; ‚å¨ 2 (6) œ≠ 1142.25).</p><p>Descriptive statistics and correlations for the study variables are presented in <ref type="table" coords="7,96.80,436.47,27.52,7.91" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The sample of Study 1 had a nested data structure: Employees were nested within supervisors of their work groups. We calculated ICC 1 from a one-way random-effects ANOVA model with <ref type="bibr" coords="7,134.11,469.92,60.03,7.91" target="#b3">Bartko's (1976)</ref> formula. The ICC 1 for promotability was .27 (p œΩ .001), suggesting substantial variance of promotability at the group level. Therefore, we used multilevel analysis to test the model to control for between-groups variances <ref type="bibr" coords="7,48.00,514.51,104.27,7.91" target="#b58">(Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. We centered the independent variable at its grand means before evaluating the regression equations (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,63.32,536.80,79.48,7.91" target="#b0">Aiken &amp; West, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,145.88,536.80,138.26,7.91" target="#b11">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003)</ref>. And we used this centering procedure in all three studies.</p><p>Hypotheses 1a and 1b predicted that the frequencies of promotive and prohibitive voice, respectively, have inverted U-shaped relationships with managers' evaluations of voicing employees. As shown in Model 1 of <ref type="table" coords="7,128.09,592.54,26.69,7.91" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we entered the control variables in the first step. Employee gender (‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.30, p œΩ .05), employee past performance (‚ê§ œ≠ .76, p œΩ .001), and manager's attribution (‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.15, p œΩ .05) were significantly related to manager-rated promotability. In Model 2, we entered promotive voice and prohibitive voice, which were not significantly related to promotability. In Model 3, we entered the quadratic terms of promotive voice and prohibitive voice and found that neither promotive voice nor prohibitive voice had a nonlinear relationship with promotability. Thus, Hypotheses 1a and 1b were not supported. Hypothesis 1c predicted that, at high frequency levels, the negative effect of prohibitive voice is stronger than that of promotive voice. As we did not find curvilinear main effects of either promotive voice or prohibitive voice, Hypothesis 1c was not supported.</p><p>Next, we tested the moderating effect of LMX on the curvilinear relationship between the frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice and managers' evaluations of voicing employees (Hypotheses 2a and 2b). As presented in <ref type="table" coords="7,397.95,133.06,26.51,7.91" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we entered the moderator LMX in Model 4 and then the linear interaction of voice frequency (promotive and prohibitive voice) and LMX in Model 5. None of these terms was significant for promotability. In Model 6, the interaction term of quadratic promotive voice and LMX was not significant (‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.01, ns), and thus Hypothesis 2a was not supported. Yet, the interaction term of quadratic prohibitive voice and LMX was significant (‚ê§ œ≠ .32, p œΩ .01, ‚å¨R 2 œ≠ .15). We thus performed additional analyses to test Hypothesis 2b by examining the simple slopes of the regression lines corresponding to all possible combinations of different frequency levels of prohibitive voice with high and low levels of LMX (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,465.97,256.31,76.20,7.91" target="#b0">Aiken &amp; West, 1991)</ref>. Results of simple slope tests (see <ref type="table" coords="7,427.40,267.52,26.56,7.91">Table 3</ref>) showed that, in the case of high LMX, the simple slope of the regression lines was significant for promotability only at a very high frequency level (‚ê§ œ≠ .97, p œΩ .05, 2 SD above the mean). By contrast, in the case of low LMX, the very low (‚ê§ œ≠ 1.79, p œΩ .01, 2 SD below the mean) and low frequencies of prohibitive voice (‚ê§ œ≠ .96, p œΩ .01, 1 SD below the mean) were positively related to promotability; the medium (‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.14, ns) and high (‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.69, ns, 1 SD above the mean) voice frequencies were not significantly related to promotability; and the very high frequency of prohibitive voice (‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.85, p œΩ .05, 2 SD above the mean) was negatively related to promotability. To facilitate the interpretation of this quadratic-by-linear interaction effect, we visualize the interaction in <ref type="figure" coords="7,458.96,401.87,34.79,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure 2A</ref>. As shown in the figure, when LMX was high, the effect of prohibitive voice became positive rather than negative at the very high frequency level. When LMX was low, there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between the frequency of prohibitive voice and promotability. Thus, Hypothesis 2b was supported.</p><p>Hypothesis 2c predicts that the moderating effect of LMX on the curvilinear linkage between prohibitive voice and managers' evaluations is stronger than that between promotive voice and managers' evaluations. To compare the moderating effects of LMX on these two linkages, we performed a relative weight analysis (Johnson, 2000) by using RWA-Web <ref type="bibr" coords="7,426.43,525.00,115.72,7.91" target="#b66">(Tonidandel &amp; LeBreton, 2015)</ref>. Confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the relative weight of each interactive effect and all corresponding significance tests were based on bootstrapping with 10,000 replications. The results indicated that the quadratic-by-linear effect of prohibitive voice and LMX was the most salient predictor, explaining roughly 35% of the variance of promotability (relative weight [RW] œ≠ .35 [.02, .15]). Moreover, a relative comparison analysis showed that the relative weight for the quadratic-by-linear interactive effect of 2 To examine the robustness of our findings, we controlled for different sets of variables across the three studies. We performed additional tests to see whether we would obtain different results by removing the control variables in the three studies. If we removed all the control variables, we obtained essentially the same results in all three studies. Also, as prior employee performance is strongly related to managers' responses to employee voice across all three studies, we did another set of analyses by controlling for prior performance only. Again, we found essentially the same results in all three studies.

Therefore, Hypothesis 2c was supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In summary, in Study 1 we did not find any significant main curvilinear effects of the frequency of promotive and prohibitive voice on manager-rated promotability <ref type="figure" coords="8,185.89,365.79,98.71,7.91">(Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c)</ref>, but we did find support for Hypotheses 2b and 2c. Specifically, we found robust results for the inverted U-shaped link between voice frequency and promotability under the condition of low rather than high LMX, and for prohibitive voice rather than promotive voice. Study 1 had two weaknesses, however. First, the independent variable and the outcome variable were both rated by supervisors, leading to a concern about common source bias, even though we used a time-lagged design. Second, we collected data from China, which has a large power distance culture <ref type="bibr" coords="8,466.06,269.79,58.40,7.91" target="#b27">(Hofstede, 2001</ref>) that may predispose employees to remain silent in organizations and managers to be less tolerant of employees' challenging voice <ref type="bibr" coords="8,306.00,302.79,182.67,7.91" target="#b31">(Huang, Van de Vliert, &amp; Van der Vegt, 2005)</ref>.

We first obtained a letter of support from the Company's Chief Operating Officer and then invited participants to complete paper-and-pencil surveys during working hours. All invited participants were briefed about the purpose and procedures of this survey study. And all these employees and supervisors were informed that participation was voluntary and confidentiality was ensured. On average, the managers' span of control was about eight people (ranging from four to14). Individuals were nested in teams which typically specialized in the same functional area, or similar/relevant areas. We invited 779 employees and 97 supervising managers from the same location to participate in our survey. Respondents were from different functional teams (e.g., business operations, data service consulting, cloud operations, small business solutions, mobile solutions, global sales, enterprise application services, and brand communication). The final sample consisted of 289 employees and 48 managers. The effective response rates were approximately 37.1% for employees and 49.5% for managers. For the employee sample, 40.8% were male, and 25.6% held a master's degree or above. The mean age and organizational tenure of the employees were 29.8 and 4.6 years, respectively. For the manager sample, 70.9% were male, and all manager respondents held a bachelor's degree or above. The mean age and organizational tenure of the manager sample were 38.2 and 11.7 years, respectively. Measures. We used the same measures as those in Study 1, except that we used a different measure for promotability. We used only two items from Burris' (2012) measure of promotability and removed the third item, which focused on overall performance. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients was .81 for promotive voice, .87 for prohibitive voice, .88 for LMX, and .92 for promotability. Like in Study 1, we controlled for employees' demographic variables and past performance (‚ê£ œ≠ .91). We did not control for impression management because we were not allowed to add additional variables into our questionnaires and also impression management did not substantially affect our results.</p></div>

Therefore, Hypothesis 1a was not supported. In contrast, the quadratic term of prohibitive voice was negatively related to promotability (‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.17, p œΩ .01). The simple slopes of the regression line for promotability at the very low, low, medium, high, and very high frequency levels of prohibitive voice (‚ê§ œ≠ 1.29, p œΩ .001; ‚ê§ œ≠ .82, p œΩ .001; ‚ê§ œ≠ .34, p œΩ .001; ‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.14, ns; ‚ê§ œ≠ œ™.61, p œΩ .001) indicated an inverted U-shaped relationship. These findings lent support for Hypothesis 1b. The fact that we found a significant inverted U-shaped relationship for prohibitive voice but not for promotive voice also lent initial support for Hypothesis 1c.</p><p>As shown in Model 6 of <ref type="table" coords="9,408.45,491.18,26.78,7.91" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>, we did not find a significant quadratic-by-linear interactive effect of promotive voice and LMX on promotability. Thus, Hypothesis 2a was not supported. We did find, however, that the quadratic-by-linear interaction of prohibitive voice and LMX was significant for promotability (‚ê§ œ≠ .09, p œΩ .05, ‚å¨R 2 œ≠ .04). As shown in <ref type="table" coords="9,428.86,547.15,25.85,7.91">Table 3</ref>, simple slope tests found a significant inverted U-shaped link between prohibitive voice and promotability in low rather than high LMX dyads (also see <ref type="figure" coords="9,522.55,569.53,23.50,7.91;9,306.00,580.72,7.88,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure  2B</ref>). These findings again supported Hypothesis 2b. Also, LMX was found to moderate the curvilinear effect of prohibitive voice rather than that of promotive voice on managers' evaluations, which lent initial support to Hypothesis 2c. We then performed a relative importance test by using RWA-Web <ref type="bibr" coords="9,489.41,625.50,56.64,7.91;9,306.00,636.69,58.01,7.91" target="#b66">(Tonidandel &amp; LeBreton, 2015)</ref>, as we did in Study 1, to further confirm Hypotheses 1c and 2c. Results indicated that the quadratic effect of prohibitive voice explained more variance of promotability (RW œ≠ .15) than the quadratic effect of promotive voice did (RW œ≠ .03 [œ™.08, œ™.01]), thereby supporting Hypothesis 1c.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Using employee-rated voice behavior in Study 2, we not only replicated the significant results reported in Study 1 that supported Hypotheses 2b and 2c, but also found new evidence to support Hypotheses 1b and 1c. The key limitation of Studies 1 and 2, however, is that we did not examine the mediating effect of manager-perceived voice constructiveness. We therefore conducted Study 3 to test this mechanism using another sample.</p><p>Also, in Study 3, we attempted to address three additional methodological limitations of Studies 1 and 2. First, the differences in the results of Studies 1 and 2 could have been caused by either cultural differences (China vs. the United States) or differences in how voice was measured (manager-rated vs. employeerated voice). Hence, in Study 3, using another U.S. sample (hold-ing national culture constant), we measured challenging voice using manager-rated voice, which is more in line with our theory: Managers should be aware of the frequency of employees' challenging voice. Second, in Studies 1 and 2, we examined managerrated promotability as the indicator of managers' evaluations. Although promotability may reflect managers' evaluations of employees, it is important to examine whether our model can be extended to predict managers' evaluations of employees' overall performance, because past studies have used overall performance as another major indicator of managers' evaluations of employees <ref type="bibr" coords="10,306.00,646.04,52.31,7.91" target="#b7">(Burris, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,362.37,646.04,72.68,7.91" target="#b8">Burris et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,439.10,646.04,106.92,7.91" target="#b46">Maynes &amp; Podsakoff, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,306.00,657.54,70.99,7.91" target="#b75">Whiting et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,383.63,657.54,15.50,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting et al., , 2012</ref>. Hence, in Study 3, we used managerrated overall performance of voicing employees as the dependent variable. Third, one possible criticism of Studies 1 and 2 is that the results may have been confounded with some individual difference variables of both subordinates and supervisors, such as subordinates' proactivity and managers' negative affectivity and openness This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>to voice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Method Sample and procedure. We invited employees and their supervising managers working at a large financial services company in the United States to participate in this study. This study was conducted under Institutional Review Board Protocol #16 -438 EP1703 (The Impact of Prosocial Behaviors on Workplace Outcomes) at Auburn University. We first obtained a letter of support from the company's Human Resources Department and then invited participants to complete online surveys. All invited participants were briefed about the purpose and procedures of this survey study. In addition, all these employees and supervisors were informed that participation was voluntary and confidentiality was ensured. The managers' average span of control was 8.8 people, ranging from five to 14. Individuals were nested in teams special-izing in the same functional area, or similar/relevant areas. The invited participants worked in a number of areas, such as home and auto insurance, corporate finance, asset management, financial planning, investment accounting, operations, and communications. Survey data were collected in one location at two time points that were separated by approximately four weeks. At Time 1, we invited 565 employees to answer questions about their proactive personality and LMX. We received 392 completed questionnaires (69.4%). We then asked the 63 supervising managers of these 392 employee respondents to answer questions about their subordinates' past performance, promotive voice, prohibitive voice, and voice constructiveness, as well as their own negative affect and openness. We collected 206 matched questionnaires from 46 supervising managers (73.0%). At Time 2, we asked those 46 manager respondents to rate their subordinates' overall performance. All 46 managers returned their questionnaires (100%). Therefore, our final sample consisted of 206 employees nested under 46 supervising managers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Study 3, we not only replicated the findings of Studies 1 and 2 that supported Hypotheses 2b and 2c, but also obtained empirical evidence supporting Hypotheses 3b, 3c, 4b, and 4c. These findings support our key proposition that the frequency of challenging voice, voice content, and LMX context jointly predict managers' evaluations of voicing employees through influencing how managers perceive the constructiveness of voice. In Study 3, the pattern of the interactive effects of prohibitive voice and LMX on manager-perceived voice constructiveness and manager-rated overall performance was very similar to the pattern of those effects on manager-rated promotability found in Studies 1 and 2. This result remained robust even when we included a few more control variables, such as employee proactivity, managers' openness, and managers' negative affectivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Discussion</head><p>The central contention of the current research is that the frequency of challenging voice and managers' evaluations of voicing employees are not related in a linear manner, as previously assumed <ref type="bibr" coords="15,108.57,616.04,53.25,7.91" target="#b7">(Burris, 2012)</ref>. Rather, as findings across our three studies have largely supported, there exists an inverted U-shaped relationship between the frequency of challenging voice and managers' ratings of voicers' promotability (Studies 1 and 2) and their overall performance evaluations (Study 3), especially when the content of challenging voice is prohibitive rather than promotive in nature and when the voicers have a low rather than high level of LMX with managers. In Study 3, we also found that, in the case of low LMX, manager-perceived voice constructiveness mediated the curvilinear effect of pro-hibitive voice on manager-rated overall performance of voicers.

Second, our findings suggest that the mixed results regarding the consequences of challenging voice reported in the literature can be explained not only by identifying its boundary conditions but also by modeling a nonlinear effect of the frequency of voice. Specifically, some previous studies have reported that challenging voice sometimes receives positive reactions <ref type="bibr" coords="16,184.90,410.29,50.22,7.91" target="#b7">(Burris, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,237.10,410.29,50.96,7.91;16,48.00,421.29,19.37,7.91" target="#b74">Whiting et al., 2012)</ref>, whereas other studies have reported that it receives negative reactions <ref type="bibr" coords="16,83.77,432.29,51.53,7.91" target="#b7">(Burris, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,138.59,432.29,73.84,7.91" target="#b61">Seibert et al., 2001)</ref> or even no reaction (Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998) from managers.

Departing from this linear approach to understanding the consequences of voice, our studies have demonstrated the critical yet overlooked role of the frequency of challenging voice and its nonlinear effect on managers' evaluations of voicing employees.

In addition to taking the content of challenging voice (promotive and prohibitive) into account as <ref type="bibr" coords="16,412.27,243.40,92.45,7.91" target="#b9">Chamberlin et al. (2017)</ref> suggested, our results show that it is also important to model the differential effects of the two types of voice in a nonlinear manner. Indeed, across the three studies, we found a significant quadratic-by-linear interactive effect of prohibitive voice and LMX on managers' evaluations, although we did not find a nonlinear effect of promotive voice in either high or low LMX dyads. In other words, the hypothesized inverted U-shaped effect can be observed for prohibitive voice but not for promotive voice in low LMX dyads. Although <ref type="bibr" coords="16,342.62,343.17,96.10,7.91">Chamberlin et al.'s (2017)</ref> meta-analytical study clearly shows that prohibitive voice tends to lead to managers' negative evaluations in general, our nonlinear model has further advanced our understanding of managers' responses to prohibitive voice by showing that managers may appreciate prohibitive voice from outgroup members when these employees refrain from speaking out very frequently.</p><p>It is theoretically interesting to contemplate why we did not find consistently significant effects of promotive voice. Because promotive voice focuses on suggesting solutions and new ideas, perhaps the quality of these solutions and ideas may be more critical in affecting managers' evaluations of their constructiveness as well as their evaluations of the voicing employees. It is easier to point out problems than to come up with good solutions. Thus, it is possible that promotive voice induces managers' positive eval- Note.

Indeed, in Study 3, we found a significant linear interaction of promotive voice and LMX, in that the positive effect of promotive voice frequency on manager-rated overall performance is stronger in high LMX dyads than in low ones. This is perhaps because managers tend to make positive assessments of the voice quality of ingroup members. As LMX may not fully capture the quality of voice from ingroup employees, we did not find this linear interaction consistently across the three samples. To confirm this speculation, future research should directly examine whether the effect of promotive voice is shaped by moderators, such as perceived quality of voice. Fourth, our findings highlight the role of LMX in shaping the consequences of challenging voice for managers' evaluations of voicers. Social persuasion theory suggests that people are more likely to accept influence from their ingroup members than from outgroup members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="17,142.67,253.04,82.19,7.91" target="#b5">Bri√±ol &amp; Petty, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,228.51,253.04,59.54,7.91;17,48.00,264.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b10">Clark &amp; Maass, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,71.73,264.04,80.43,7.91" target="#b13">Crano &amp; Chen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,155.39,264.04,88.31,7.91" target="#b49">Menon &amp; Blount, 2003)</ref>. Across all studies, we found that LMX was strongly and positively correlated with managers' evaluations of employees and perceptions of voice constructiveness. Moreover, the moderating effects of LMX found in the three studies point to the overriding role of LMX in shaping managers' positive responses to challenging voice. It therefore would be desirable for future research to take into account the influence of LMX when investigating the consequences of challenging voice for managers' evaluations.</p><p>Fifth, Study 3 demonstrated that manager-perceived voice constructiveness is a key mechanism that may help explain the joint effects of voice frequency, voice content, and LMX on managers' evaluations. Also, as shown in <ref type="table" coords="17,162.27,396.04,30.75,7.91" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>, LMX had a strong main effect on voice constructiveness, corroborating our key logic: Relational contexts shape managers' cognitive assessments of the beneficial outcomes of voice, which in turn influences managers' responses.

The findings of the three studies offer evidence for the cross-cultural generalizability of our model. Given the large power distance culture of China, subordination is socially expected by both managers and employees <ref type="bibr" coords="17,259.79,561.03,28.24,7.91;17,48.00,572.03,156.06,7.91" target="#b28">(House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, &amp; Gupta, 2004)</ref>. One could argue that, in such a context, Chinese managers may be less accepting of challenging voice from employees than are their counterparts in the West. Likewise, managers from a small-power-distance culture may not see engaging in challenging voice as an act of insubordination; instead, they may regard such behavior as constructive to organizations. Countering these views, we indeed found a significant main curvilinear effect of prohibitive voice in Study 2 and a significant quadratic-by-linear interactive effect of prohibitive voice and LMX in Studies 2 and 3. These findings suggest that U.S. managers, like their Chinese counterparts, do not tolerate high frequency prohibitive voice from outgroup employees. Although we are not entirely certain that our findings can be generalized to nations other than China and the United States, based on our theoretical reasoning and the robust empirical findings, we do expect that this curvilinear effect of challenging voice would be found in different cultures in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Despite the strengths of using three independent samples, timelagged surveys in all studies, and both supervisor-rated (Studies 1 and 3) and subordinate-rated (Study 2) voice, our research has three limitations. First, in Studies 1 and 3, our independent variables, the mediator, and the dependent variables came from the same source: the supervisors. This may raise concerns about common method bias. To partially address this limitation, we used subordinate-reported measures of challenging voice in Study 2 and found results similar to those in Studies 1 and 3. Using subordinate-rated voice remains problematic too, however. It is methodologically reasonable to ask supervisors to report their perceived employees' voice behavior. In reality, managers sometimes may not be aware of employees' voice behavior. More important, according to our theorization, managers' evaluations of voicing employees are driven by their observations of particular employees' frequency of voice. To establish this relationship, we need to make sure that managers are aware of their employees' voice behavior. If we ask employees to report their own voice behavior, we cannot fully capture managers' perceived frequency. To accurately measure employee voice while also avoiding common source problems, future research should consider using labbased studies to manipulate employee voice frequency.</p><p>Second, managers' evaluations of promotability, overall performance, and voice constructiveness could be influenced by another key voice characteristic: the quality of voice. Quality of messages, which is often operationalized in terms of the strength of arguments, has been widely used in experimental settings to predict message receivers' reactions to a single "incident" of persuasion <ref type="bibr" coords="17,306.00,458.76,82.03,7.91" target="#b5">(Bri√±ol &amp; Petty, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,390.62,458.76,87.39,7.91" target="#b17">Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1998)</ref>. In organizational settings, however, managers' evaluations of voicing employees are less likely to be influenced by the quality of a single incident of voice. Also, it is difficult to judge the quality of voiced messages, because, unlike in experimental settings, it may take time for managers to learn the quality of voice from employees. In field settings, voice quality can be conceptualized as either a voicer characteristic or a voice characteristic. It is a voicer characteristic when it is conceptualized as an employee's "history" of voice quality. It becomes a voice characteristic if the quality of voice is conceptualized in terms of whether the voiced issues are within the voicers' functional area of expertise <ref type="bibr" coords="17,444.96,581.38,97.21,7.91" target="#b16">(Dutton &amp; Ashford, 1993)</ref>. Given its conceptual and operationalization complexity in field settings, we did not incorporate quality of voice in our model. Nevertheless, we encourage future researchers to theorize and investigate how quality of voice plays a role in the nonlinear relationship between frequency of challenging voice and managers' evaluations of voicers.</p><p>Finally, voice constructiveness was measured using a two-item scale adopted from <ref type="bibr" coords="17,382.78,670.49,53.75,7.91" target="#b22">Gorden (1988)</ref>.

Future research should develop a scale that can better reflect this cognitive process. Our results may suggest some new directions for studying the effects of challenging voice on managers' evaluations of voicers. First, we cast LMX as a key relational context moderator in our model, focusing on how managers respond differentially to ingroup voicers and outgroup voicers. Research studies, however, have suggested that the triadic relationship between a manager, an ingroup subordinate, and an outgroup subordinate can be more complex than previous research on LMX has assumed <ref type="bibr" coords="18,245.76,176.04,42.28,7.91;18,48.00,187.04,47.64,7.91">(Sherony &amp; Green, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,98.54,187.04,138.84,7.91" target="#b68">Tse, Lam, Lawrence, &amp; Huang, 2013)</ref>. The manager's responses to the voice behavior of an ingroup subordinate may be influenced by the outgroup subordinate's responses to the voice behavior, or vice versa. Future research could extend our model by examining the potential influences from a third party in the work group. Second, in addition to message, source, and context factors, social persuasion theory also suggests that receiver characteristics play a key role in receivers' reactions to persuasion <ref type="bibr" coords="18,250.31,264.04,37.73,7.91;18,48.00,275.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1985)</ref>. Thus, another direction of expanding our model would be to consider a set of managers' key characteristics (receiver factors) such as managers' proactive personality <ref type="bibr" coords="18,198.04,297.04,51.12,7.91" target="#b54">(Parker, 1998)</ref>, that may influence the curvilinear effects of challenging voice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Our findings have several useful implications for practitioners. First, it is essential for subordinates to understand the true risks of voicing out challenging issues to their managers. The findings of the current study suggest that challenging voice, such as prohibitive voice, may not be as risky as previously assumed. A moderate frequency of prohibitive voice can project a positive image to managers, even when the voicing employees are not members of the managers' ingroup. More important, subordinates who have low LMX with their managers should be aware that only very frequent prohibitive voice tends to induce managers' unfavorable responses. Second, in concert with what we know from the LMX and voice literatures, the most effective way for subordinates to influence managers is to develop high levels of social exchange relationships with them. Third, managers can learn from our study that the frequency of employees' voicing may influence their evaluations of the voiced messages, causing them to overlook some very important issues. Managers tend to have unfavorable evaluations of the voice of outgroup members in general, yet our findings show that managers may indeed appreciate voice from outgroup members when these members voice up challenging issues at a moderate frequency. Managers, however, tend to degrade those outgroup members who voice up challenging issues very frequently. As such, managers may inadvertently discourage outgroup members from raising important issues and miss opportunities to identify critical problems that may affect their organizations' functioning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="10,117.00,489.20,360.03,7.03;10,117.00,499.20,165.96,7.03"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Results of the quadratic-by-linear interactive effect of prohibitive voice and leader-member exchange quality (LMX) on promotability (Studies 1 and 2).</figDesc></figure>
