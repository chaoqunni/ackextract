			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The authors draw on the phenomenon of processing fluency to develop a memory-based account of target and nontarget market effects related to consumer evaluations of culture-specific website designs. The test of the study's hypotheses relies on longitudinal experimental data from Tunisian minority and French majority consumers in France. The psychological mechanisms that drive website evaluations appear to differ for the two populations. French majority consumers are alienated by culturally incongruent website design, but this negative effect is alleviated by repeated exposure. Tunisian minority consumers tend to prefer website design with a French look and feel, and repeated exposure enhances this effect. The results from an explorative post hoc study echo these findings and suggest that effects of culture-specific website design on consumer website evaluations are contingent on the website product category.</p></div>

Studies show that culture-specific advertising can generate unfavorable reactions in some consumers who consider that they are not being targeted or may feel alienated <ref type="bibr" coords="1,147.80,544.69,136.98,7.54" target="#b0">(Aaker, Brumbaugh, and Grier, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,33.73,555.12,45.93,7.54" target="#b56">Torres, 2007)</ref>.

A website has high WCC when it displays cultural markers of a target culture in terms of typical colors, symbols, heroes, or rituals <ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.72,440.08,108.80,7.54" target="#b10">(Bartikowski and Singh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,412.72,440.08,79.15,7.54" target="#b17">Cho and Cheon, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,494.07,440.08,58.69,7.54;1,301.72,450.52,21.09,7.54" target="#b39">Luna and Gupta, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,326.15,450.52,134.47,7.54" target="#b40">Luna, Peracchio, and De Juan, 2002)</ref>. The authors propose a memory-based account of WCC effects in which they differentiate two dimensions of processing fluency: conceptual and perceptual. The test of the hypotheses relies on longitudinal experimental data from Tunisian minority and French majority consumers in France. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,523.56,492.36,29.19,7.54;1,301.72,502.84,87.70,7.54">Johnson and Grier (2011, p. 253)</ref> call France an "ideal multicultural marketing laboratory for targeting without alienating" because of the particular context that favors integration of immigrants and imposes cultural assimilation.</p><p>The study complements and extends previous research in several ways. First, it offers insights into target and nontarget market effects of culture-specific website design. A large body of research almost concordantly suggests that consumers respond positively to higher levels of WCC, but no study tests these effects for ethnic minority consumers. Such insights are particularly relevant because of the increasing importance of the Internet to reach ethnic minority consumers <ref type="bibr" coords="1,506.89,607.44,45.89,7.54;1,301.72,617.87,65.03,7.54" target="#b11">(Becerra and Korgaonkar, 2010)</ref>. Moreover, nontarget market websites are just one click away and can be easily reached by members of both ethnic minority and majority consumers. Second, the study offers new insights beyond what is known on the psychological processes that drive ethnic minority and majority consumer evaluations of culture-specific marketing communication. Extant studies use cross-sectional designs and emphasize the important role of cultural memory to explain target and nontarget market effects <ref type="bibr" coords="1,398.38,691.12,73.77,7.54" target="#b0">(Aaker et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,475.60,691.12,77.17,7.54" target="#b7">Antioco et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.72,701.61,68.75,7.54" target="#b14">Brumbaugh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,373.38,701.61,106.93,7.54" target="#b24">Grier and Brumbaugh, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,483.13,701.61,69.58,7.54;2,42.52,57.81,19.68,7.54" target="#b33">Johnson and Grier, 2011)</ref>. However, no study manipulates this memory experimentally. Therefore, by considering two dimensions of processing fluency and testing the theoretical model with longitudinal data, the authors respond to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,77.90,89.16,76.52,7.54" target="#b14">Brumbaugh's (2002)</ref> call for more research on alternative modes of processing of culturally targeted marketing communication. Third, by focusing on WCC as a central variable, the current study broadens the scope of previous research that used models with different ethnicities to study target and nontarget market effects <ref type="bibr" coords="2,241.68,131.06,51.95,7.54;2,42.52,141.49,21.09,7.54" target="#b7">(Antioco et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,67.46,141.49,96.44,7.54" target="#b33">Johnson and Grier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,167.69,141.49,57.30,7.54" target="#b34">Karande, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,228.81,141.49,60.76,7.54" target="#b38">Lee et al., 2002)</ref>.

Finally, the authors explore the findings from their experimental study in a qualitative post hoc test. The results echo the importance of considering repeated exposure or habituation effects and suggest that effects of culture-specific website design on consumer website evaluations are contingent on the website product category.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Processing fluency</head><p>To portray a theoretical framework for explaining WCC effects, the authors draw on the processing fluency phenomenon, which according to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,51.42,622.69,130.06,7.54">Alter and Oppenheimer (2009, p. 219</ref>) is a "ubiquitous metacognitive cue in reasoning and social judgment".

For example, consumers who do price or product comparisons frequently surf the same websites again, whether they liked them or not on a first exposure.</p><p>Notably, fluency effects exist independently of one's cultural values or felt ethnic identity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,393.56,674.96,164.02,7.54" target="#b4">(Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, and Eyre, 2007)</ref>.

Arguably, this category can isolate potential interactions with WCC that may emerge in relation to culturally laden categories, such as ethnic clothes or food. The mock website displayed the invented brand name LTLC and promoted altogether 117 products in seven subcategories (computer, peripherals, consumables, MP3, games, software, and digital cameras).</p><p>One version of the mock website featured cultural markers of the Tunisian culture (WCC minority ) and the other version featured cultural markers of the French culture (WCC majority ), with otherwise identical content. The WCC minority site used design elements that are reminiscent of the Tunisian culture, such as a dominantly red color (the Tunisian national color) together with typical symbols and Tunisian references. The WCC majority counterpart used French national colors (white, blue, and red) along with typical French symbols and pictures of well-known French references. On the WCC minority site, the LTLC brand name was displayed in red, with a squiggle font (oriental style); on the WCC majority site, LTLC was displayed in blue color, with a rectilinear font style. Both website versions used the.fr country code top-level domain to suggest that the company operates in France.</p><p>The manipulation check involved WCC evaluations from 33 French (49% female; 73% are 34 years or younger) and 31 Tunisian (58% female; 74% are 34 years or younger) consumers.

The WCC composite scores show that participants from both cultures perceived the WCC minority site as more culturally congruent to the Tunisian culture than the WCC majority site, and inversely the WCC majority site as more culturally congruent to the French culture than the WCC minority site. Paired-sample t-tests show that these mean score differences are highly significant (p b .01) for all four pairs (ethnic affiliation × WCC), in support of the effectiveness of the WCC manipulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data collection</head><p>The authors recruited study participants over social media network sites. Online questionnaire links were posted on large minority online communities such as "Les Tunisiens à Paris" (Viadeo.fr) or "La communauté Tunisienne en France" (Facebook.fr), and respectively on mainstream French online communities. The participants entered randomly one of the four treatment conditions (WCC × repetition) and were asked to browse the assigned website to gather product and purchasing information. The instructions stated that the mock website is an online shop in France under construction (no real purchase could be made). Participants in the low perceptual fluency condition (only one exposure) filled a French language questionnaire that measured the variables of interest on their first (and only) visit of the mock website. Participants in the repeated exposure condition were first asked to respond to some filler questions. We recontacted them four weeks later and asked them to browse the same website again and answer the questions that measure the three dependent variables.</p><p>The measures for the dependent variables came from previous studies and were adapted to the present context (see Appendix A). The scales underwent a translation and back-translation procedure with two bilingual (English-French) speakers, and were pretested and refined with data gathered from a convenience sample of 30 graduate students and two colleagues. The whole data collection lasted approximately six months, during which responses were gathered from 150 French (54% female; 76% are 34 years or younger) and 151 Tunisian (51% female; 61% are 34 years or younger) study participants.</p></div>

One item of the 6-item trust scale showed a poor factor loading (λ b .5) and was excluded from the subsequent analyses (see Appendix A). The measurement model with the remaining items achieved a good fit (RMSEA = .08, SRMR = .06, CFI = .92, χ 2 /df = 3.14). All indicators load in both groups strongly and significantly (p b .01) on their respective target factors. As <ref type="table" coords="4,490.00,235.65,27.63,7.54" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows, the Cronbach's alpha values (α) and composite reliabilities (ρ) are greater than .8 for all scales, and the average variances extracted (AVEs) are greater than .5, suggesting convergent validity for these constructs <ref type="bibr" coords="4,310.51,277.49,115.81,7.54" target="#b6">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>.

Hence, H1a receives no support. Again overall, the effect of repeated website exposure is H2 stated that repeated exposure enhances website evaluations particularly for low WCC websites. As expected, the mean score differences between single and repeated exposures are larger for low than for high WCC sites, notably for trust (3.61-3.1 = .51 vs. 3.47-3.32 = .15), for attitude (3.81-3.06 = .75 vs. 3.8-3.33 = .47), and for purchase intention (2.64-2.4 = .24 vs. 2.71-2.73 = −.02). The WCC × exposure interaction is significant for trust (F(1, 293) = 4.42, p b .05), but not for attitude (F(1, 293) = 2.06, p N .05) and not for purchase intention (F(1, 293) = 1.23, p N .05). Hence, although the effects are in the expected direction for all three dependent variables, the statistical tests suggest only partial support for H2.</p><p>With H3 we assumed the strength of WCC effects on website evaluations to be stronger for majority than for ethnic minority consumers, which is clearly supported for all three dependent variables. The interactions between cultural affiliation and WCC are highly significant for trust (F(1, 293) = 28.65, p b .01), for attitude (F(1, 293) = 25.58, p b .01), and for purchase intention (F(1, 293) = 28.45, p b .01). Inspections of η 2 for the two cultural groups suggest that the WCC effect sizes are consistently stronger for the French majorities than for the Tunisian minorities for all three dependent variables, namely for trust (η 2 = .11 vs. .07), for attitude (η 2 = .15 vs. .04), and for purchase intention (η 2 = .14 vs. .05). Although these results support H3, the direction of the effects is opposite to the predictions made in H1a. The data shows strong positive effects of high WCC for French majority consumers, namely for trust Finally, H4 suggested that negative effects of low WCC will be attenuated by repeated exposure, in particular for majority consumers. For the French majorities, the data reveals significant WCC × exposure interactions in the expected direction for trust (2.97-2.6 = .37 vs. 3.24-3.42 = −.18; F(1, 146) = 3.93, p b .05) and for purchase intention (1.86-1.63 = .23 vs. 2.36-2.78 = −.42; F(1, 146) = 3.63, p b .05). The effect is also in the hypothesized direction for attitude, but the interaction is statistically not significant (2.96-2.6 = .36 vs. 3.43-3.4 = .03; F(1, 146) = 1.75, p N .05). By contrast, for the Tunisian minorities, the WCC × exposure interaction is non-significant for any of the dependent variables, notably for trust (4.25-3.51 = .74 vs. 3.71-3.22 = .49; F(1, 147) = 1.03, p N .05), for attitude (4.65-3.51 = 1.14 vs. 4.19-3.27 = .92; F(1, 147) = .57, p N .05), and purchase intention (3.42-3.16 = .26 vs. 3.08-2.67 = .41; F(1, 147) = .22, p N .05). In combination, the results suggest support for H4 because repeated exposure attenuates negative effects of low WCC sites for French majority consumers, but there is no such effect for Tunisian minority consumers <ref type="figure" coords="5,471.62,382.09,20.96,7.54" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2</ref>). It appears that the psychological processes that are activated by WCC and repeated website exposure work very differently for members of these two groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Post hoc study</head><p>Some unexpected results from the experimental study require further explorations. Why do both Tunisian minority and French majority consumers prefer electronic retail websites with a French look and feel? Can the same effect be expected for websites that sell cultureladen products, such as traditional Tunisian food, clothing, furniture, or handicrafts? The post hoc study was set up to answer these questions and gain further insights into how consumers think about culturespecific website design.</p><p>To ensure a deep understanding, the authors recruited 16 consumers (eight French and eight Tunisians, all living in France) as informants who agreed to conduct a 30-min individual interview during which they were exposed to four experimental websites. The websites varied with respect to the product category (consumer electronics versus typical oriental products) and culture-specific design (French versus oriental-looking). The number of pages (each website had four pages), the navigation logic, and the way products or services were presented were kept constant for all sites in order to avoid response biases related to these technical aspects.</p><p>Half of the informants first surfed the two versions of the electronic retail website and the other half first started with the two versions of the site with oriental products. The interviews were conducted by two trained research assistants. The interview procedure followed closely <ref type="bibr" coords="5,301.72,685.45,83.82,7.54" target="#b65">Zhou and Belk's (2004)</ref> reader-response approach to study global and local advertising appeals. Informants were allowed to surf the websites as long as they wanted and to look at them as many times as they wanted. The interview started after exposure to the first category. When respondents provided no more new responses they were asked to surf the two website versions of the other category and the interview  continued. The interviews were unstructured, but began by asking the informants to tell what they thought about each website. Follow-up probes sought to learn whether informants liked or disliked each site, which version was preferred, whether there were any confusing aspects, and most important, why they gave the answers they gave. Overall, the results suggest that website design preference is contingent on the product category (p b .05): for electronics, all eight French and five Tunisian informants clearly preferred the French design. The results were almost in the opposite direction for oriental products with all eight Tunisians preferring the oriental design and four French preferring the French design. Hence, although the majority of respondents (81%) preferred the French design for electronics (exact binomial p (twotailed) = .022), the oriental design was preferred by most (75%) for the websites with oriental products (exact binomial p (two-tailed) = .077). In addition, Fisher's exact test reveals that these preferences are not contingent on the informants' cultural affiliation (p N .05), in particular for electronics (p = .199) (confirming results from the experimental study, see H1a) or for oriental products (p = .077).</p><p>The main arguments in favor of the French design for electronics relate to service and product quality (e.g., "I think that the French website offers better after-sales services"), usability aspects (e.g., "The French design looks more sober and does not distract me from searching information"), feelings of trust (e.g., "I fear that the oriental-looking site sells counterfeit products"), as well as habituation effects (e.g., "I am not used to seeing Arabs sell electronics in France"). Three Tunisian respondents who preferred the oriental design noted that they felt more attracted by the site's warm colors and that Tunisian references suggest "cultural openness and tolerance of a firm that operates in France".</p><p>For the websites with oriental products, the Tunisian informants repeatedly noted that the French design "does not make sense" or is "unsuitable for typical oriental products". French informants credited the oriental design for enabling them to "virtually travel and visit an oriental bazaar", which suggest to them that "the products are more authentic". Both French and Tunisian respondents expressed concerns about the oriental website's service competences and online payment security. They argued that the French design "looks more serious and more transparent", and encourages them "to buy in France instead of in a foreign country". In particular the French informants noted that the French design "looks more familiar, which makes it easier to use", again supporting the important role of habituation memory for consumer website evaluations. Interestingly, one Tunisian informant noted that typical ethnic food products, such as Harissa (a red spicy sauce) or dates are of best quality when they are bought in French stores in France. This, according to the informant, is related to the production and quality selection processes that are controlled by French companies in Tunisia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Summary and implications</head><p>The study sheds light on how Tunisian minority and French majority consumers respond to culture-specific website design, in particular, and the role of memory to explain these responses in general. Two dimensions of processing fluencyconceptual and perceptualare proposed as psychological mechanisms to study target and nontarget market effects in multicultural marketing. The experimental results with electronic retail websites show that majority consumers are alienated by culturally incongruent website design, but ethnic minority consumers are not. This asymmetry resonates with different sets of cultural knowledge held by the two groups, which enable conceptually fluent processing to different degrees. Repeated exposure enhanced website evaluations for both groups, in line with the perceptual fluency account. Repeated exposure also alleviated nontarget market effects for majority consumers. A similar finding, in terms of habituation memory, occurred from the qualitative post hoc study. Firms that are unsure about whether culturally adapted website design is needed may simply consider spending marketing dollars to enhance awareness and encourage consumers to visit a website again. They may counterbalance these costs against the costs for creating and maintaining culture-specific website designs.</p><p>The post hoc study also suggests that WCC effects are contingent on the product category. Website design that aligns with the majority population tends to be preferred for electronic retail websites, but for ethnic products a typical ethnic design seems more appropriate. These results are not clear-cut, but they suggest that some product categories are more predestined to culture-specific marketing communication than others. Future research should explore category effects in greater detail. In many instances cultural differences between ethnic minority and majority consumers are so strong that culturally differentiated communication is indispensable. For example, France's huge Muslim population is a big business for producers of halal food and halal food certification (cf., <ref type="bibr" coords="6,327.57,225.16,108.73,7.54" target="#b32">Jamal and Sharifuddin, 2014)</ref>. The holy month of Ramadan is characterized by innovative and aggressive marketing to Muslims. Particularly for religious themes, the important role of culture-specific communication simply cannot be ignored.</p><p>A definite recommendation of whether or not marketers should target ethnic minority and majority consumers with culture-specific website designs cannot be given, although it seems that higher WCC levels are generally more important to majority than to ethnic minority consumers. Multicultural websites that depict symbols and values of culturally diverse populations simultaneously may represent a golden mean. However, more research is needed to clarify this idea <ref type="bibr" coords="6,529.00,329.76,32.54,7.54;6,310.51,340.24,59.01,7.54" target="#b33">(Johnson and Grier, 2011)</ref>. Most important, it appears clear and evident from the experimental study and the explorative post hoc test that repeated exposures and habituation memory matter a great deal. In this sense, the findings deliver new insights beyond what is known from extant cross-sectional studies into target and nontarget market effects of culture-specific advertising and studies into WCC effects in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Limitations and avenues for future research</head><p>The study is subject to several limitations that offer opportunities for additional research. First, as in most experimental studies, the results are threatened by a number of biases and errors that may reduce external validity. Replications in other countries and with other ethnic groups, particularly outside of France, are encouraged. Second, the experimental manipulation of perceptual fluency may have provided participants with an opportunity to think about the stimulus. Strictly speaking, the study design failed to isolate unconscious processing and habituation memory from other repeated exposure effects that potentially led to cognitive processing. It is practically difficult to avoid such effects in experimental tests because consumers must surf and interact with websites to experience them. Future studies may use different exposure sequences or vary exposure frequencies to deliver further insights <ref type="bibr" coords="6,358.01,570.42,102.79,7.54" target="#b5">(Anand and Sternthal, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,462.90,570.42,42.29,7.54" target="#b55">Tellis, 1997)</ref>. Tachistoscope techniques may be employed to provide stronger tests of unconscious processing in relation to target and nontarget market effects of noninteractive culture-specific advertising.</p><p>Ethnic minority and majority consumer responses to culturespecific marketing communication may be influenced by various factors that are not considered in the present study. These include feelings of ethnic identity, patriotism, ethnocentrism, or minority consumer levels of acculturation. Some authors deemphasize the role of minority consumer ethnic identity <ref type="bibr" coords="6,391.52,664.53,76.53,7.54" target="#b7">(Antioco et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,470.38,664.53,91.10,7.54" target="#b33">Johnson and Grier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,310.51,675.02,61.66,7.54" target="#b38">Lee et al., 2002)</ref>. Future studies should consider that consumers may identify with multiple cultural identities simultaneously <ref type="bibr" coords="6,534.94,685.45,26.64,7.54;6,310.51,695.94,103.63,7.54" target="#b1">(Alden, Steenkamp, and Batra, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,416.29,695.94,106.07,7.54" target="#b19">Cleveland and Laroche, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,524.52,695.94,37.03,7.54;6,310.51,706.37,95.94,7.54">Cleveland, Papadopoulos, et al., 2011)</ref>. Authors should also focus on the reasons why ethnic consumers move to a foreign country. Migrants frequently strive to enhance their living conditions; in some cases, they may reject ethnic cues that remind them of unfavorable experiences in their home country or culture, such as bad living conditions or religious persecution. Finally, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,80.50,68.24,92.01,7.54" target="#b63">Winkielman et al. (2003)</ref> studied relationships between mood and the desire for fluency. They found that happy people are less interested in familiar, fluent stimuli (abstract visual patterns) than sad people. This suggests that effects of WCC-based fluency may be contingent on people's life satisfaction, an assumption that future research may test.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,260.67,738.96,65.23,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Research model.</figDesc></figure>
