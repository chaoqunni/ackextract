<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>Theories of embodied cognition emphasize the importance of sensorimotor schemas linked to external world experience for representing conceptual knowledge. Accordingly, some researchers have proposed that the spatial representation of numerical and non-numerical sequences relies on visuomotor routines, like reading habit and finger counting. There is a growing interest in how these two routines contribute to the spatial representation of ordinal sequences, although no investigation has so far directly compared them. The present study aims to investigate how these routines contribute to represent ordinal information in space. To address this issue, bilingual participants reading either from left-to-right or right-to-left were required to map ordinal information to all fingers of their right dominant hand. Critically, we manipulated both the direction of the mapping and the language of the verbal information. More specifically, a finger-mapping compatibility task was adopted in three experiments to explore the spatial representation of numerical (digit numbers and number words) and non-numerical (days of the week, presented in Hebrew and in English) sequences. Results showed that numerical information was preferentially mapped according to participants' finger counting habits, regardless of hand posture (prone and supine), number notation and reading habit. However, for non-numerical ordinal sequences, reading and finger counting directions both contributed to determine a preferential spatial mapping. These findings indicate that abstract knowledge representation relies on multiple over-trained visuomotor routines. More generally, these results highlight the capacity of our cognitive system to flexibly represent abstract ordered information, by relying on different directional experiences (finger counting, reading direction) depending on the stimuli and on the task at hand.</p></div>

Indeed, processing the position of a number in a sequence, rather than its relevant magnitude, is a sufficient condition to observe the well-known compatibility effect between numbers and space (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,136.46,203.90,82.78,7.53" target="#b70">van Dijck &amp; Fias, 2011</ref>; see for a proposal that distinguishes spatial-numerical associations in terms of cardinality and ordinality, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,127.05,224.88,139.63,7.53" target="#b52">Patro, Nuerk, Cress, &amp; Haman, 2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Combining directions: the present study</head><p>The literature supports finger counting and reading habits as determinant cultural visuomotor routines for representing ordinal information in space. However, no study has so far investigated whether the spatial representation of numbers and, more generally, of ordinal sequences relies on finger counting (FC), on reading direction (RD) or on an interplay of both. In the present study, we directly explored the strength of the ''finger-representation account" and of the ''reading-representation account" in a series of three experiments, by requiring participants to map ordinal information to all fingers of the dominant hand. Moreover, to emphasize the impact of reading direction on the spatial representation of ordinal information, Israeli participants reading both from left-to-right and from right-to-left were involved.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we tested whether Spatial-Numerical Associations (SNAs) are determined by FC direction or by the standard Western left-to-right orientation of the MNL. 1 In particular, participants performed a finger-mapping task with Arabic numbers, with the direction of the finger-digit mapping systematically varied from left-to-right or from right-to-left (i.e., 1-5: thumb-little finger vs little finger-thumb). Additionally, to test the strength of FC account we further manipulated the direction of the mapping, by requiring participants to perform the task with their right hand in both pronated and supinated posture. In Experiment 2, we explored whether SNAs on the hand space are determined by FC or by RD. Specifically, we investigated whether SNAs might adapt flexibly to situational factors, by requiring participants to map number words, presented both in English and in Hebrew, to specific fingers. Finally, we investigated the role of FC and RD in the mapping of non-numerical ordinal 1 A recent study by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,380.47,731.93,74.50,6.03" target="#b67">Shaki and Gevers (2011)</ref> found a regular SNARC effect with Arabic numbers in bilingual Israeli participants. On these grounds, in the present paper we refer to the MNL as flowing from left-to-right. information, i.e., days of the week, presented in both languages. Thus, in all experiments, we explored the spatial representation of ordinal information on the hand space, i.e., on fingers.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we hypothesized that if numbers are associated to specific fingers through long-term memory representations, responses should be faster when numbers are mapped according to participants' FC routine, independently from hand posture and from the standard orientation of the MNL. Indeed, finger-numeral representations are particularly emphasized in the current task setting, which requires a fine discrimination between all fingers of the dominant hand at the response level. Similarly, in Experiment 2, number words should be preferentially mapped according to participants' FC routine regardless of language direction, due to long-term memory finger-number associations. These patterns of results would therefore suggest that fingernumber associations are not sensitive to the direction of the cultural reading and writing habit, leading to the same response pattern in both prone and supine postures. Finally, since the mapping of non-numerical ordinal information has been shown to be modulated by RD, and since the present task setting particularly emphasizes FC, we expect both routines to contribute to the preferential spatial mapping. This hypothesis was tested in Experiment 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, participants performed a finger-number mapping compatibility task with Arabic numbers in palm-up and in palm-down postures <ref type="bibr" coords="3,113.38,366.95,77.40,7.53" target="#b17">(Di Luca et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,193.04,366.95,49.48,7.53">Experiment 2)</ref>. However, while Di Luca et al. (2006) adopted a ten-finger response setting, emphasizing both directions within and between hands, in the present study we specifically focused on numerosity 1-to-5, by requiring participants to map numbers to fingers of their right dominant hand only. In fact, a recent study by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,182.38,419.22,101.41,7.53" target="#b57">Riello and Rusconi (2011)</ref> tested the relation between MNL and FC representations by means of a unimanual classification tasks (i.e., two fingers of the same hand used to respond in different postures). Faster RTs were found only when directions of the two representations were compatible (i.e., when the right hand is pronated or the left hand is supinated, since both FC and MNL run from thumb-to-little fingers and thus from left-to-right). <ref type="bibr" coords="3,107.38,492.47,99.65,7.53" target="#b57">Riello and Rusconi (2011)</ref> suggested that this pattern might have been driven by the existence of two vectors (MNL and FC) having similar force but opposite direction in the non-compatible conditions (i.e., when the right hand is supinated or the left hand is pronated). Furthermore, they attributed the difference between their own and Di Luca et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,199.53,544.80,60.19,7.53">'s results (2006)</ref> to the response setting greatly differing in terms of finger discrimination. It remains to be established whether unimanual responses might reduce the influence of FC routine (see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,190.38,576.15,89.39,7.53" target="#b57">Riello &amp; Rusconi, 2011)</ref>.

All of them were native-born Israelis with Hebrew as their mother language and with good English skills: they were all familiar with a left-to-right language, since they started to learn English in the fourth/fifth grade of primary school (Arabic digits are typically written from left-to-right in Hebrew). They also judged them-selves as fluent in the second language and therefore we considered them altogether as bilingual or bidirectional participants.

The stimuli were presented on a Dell E198PF 19 00 LCD monitor. Participants were seated approximately 60 cm from the screen and answers were given by key press on a standard QWERTY keyboard. More specifically, participants adopted a typical typing position on the keyboard to ensure a comfortable posture for the hand and arm and a good inline positioning of the fingers (keys H, J, K, L), except for the thumb, which was lowered slightly (key B). All the non-responding keys were removed from the keyboard to facilitate finger movement. For the palm-up posture condition, the keyboard was turned upside-down and was fixed on the table. The left, non-responding, hand was always placed on the ipsilateral knee, with the same posture of the hand used to execute the task.</p></div>

Likewise, in the supine condition we had mapping C, associating 1 to the thumb and 5 to the little finger, and mapping D, associating 5 to the thumb and 1 to the little finger. Mappings resulted, therefore, as completely compatible (A) or incompatible (B) with both participants FC and MNL orientations, whereas mapping C and D were only compatible with the FC or MNL, respectively. The four mappings were assigned in a counterbalanced order across participants. A block was composed of 10 (not analyzed) practice and 50 experimental trials. The order of presentation of the stimuli was pseudorandomly determined (at least three items before the repetition of the same digit).

It was followed by the same drawing with a finger pseudorandomly darkened, that remained on the screen until the participant answered with the corresponding finger, and then ended with a blank screen lasting for 500 ms before the next trial started (see <ref type="figure" coords="4,311.53,681.43,22.20,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b</ref>).

The finger D was then subtracted from the average RT of each finger in each experimental mapping, resulting in a corrected finger RT. A further correction was applied to avoid confounding effects of hand posture. Due to the faster performance in the prone posture, for each participant the average RT of each finger in the prone posture was subtracted from its average RT in the supine posture (i.e., posture D).

However, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,497.65,422.74,55.11,7.53;5,301.72,433.17,24.96,7.53" target="#b7">Brozzoli et al. (2008)</ref> further showed that irrelevant numbers influenced a tactile detection task in a way compatible only with the MNL representation. These apparently contrasting results may be attributed to different experimental methods leading to different activation of the finger-space representation. Indeed, while in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,472.76,475.01,80.00,7.53;5,301.72,485.50,24.96,7.53">Brozzoli et al.'s study (2008)</ref> participants answered to a tactile stimulation of the hand finger with a foot response (i.e., passive hand), here a finger motor response was required (i.e., active hand). These differences might have modulated the competition between MNL and FC representations, likely resulting in higher competition when fingers representation is crucial to the selection of the response (see for a discussion, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,345.37,548.25,86.22,7.53" target="#b57">Riello &amp; Rusconi, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>

This preferential mapping can be explained by the influence of participants' previous experience with finger counting. Finger counting routine, indeed, would consolidate a systematic association between a specific finger and a specific ordinal position of the numerical sequence. To test the role of FC routine in the mapping of non-numerical information we therefore designed , as a function of the finger-number words mappings both in the English (i.e., mappings A-D) and in the Hebrew conditions (i.e., mappings E-G).

Thus we predicted that the fastest mapping should result when both routines are compatibly oriented.</p><p>6.1. Method</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.">Apparatus</head><p>We used the same apparatus as in Experiment 1. ). The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1. Eight mappings were obtained combining 3 variables: (a) days direction, referred to Sunday-Thursday finger-association (thumb-little finger, little finger-thumb), (b) hand posture (prone, supine) and (c) language (English, Hebrew). Thus, with English days in the prone condition, mapping A consisted in associating SUNDAY to the thumb and THURSDAY to the little finger, while mapping B in associating THURSDAY to the thumb and SUNDAY to the little finger. Likewise, in the supine condition we had mapping C associating SUNDAY to the thumb and THURSDAY to the little finger, and mapping D associating THURSDAY to the thumb and SUNDAY to the little finger. Therefore, in the English condition, mappings resulted as completely compatible (A) or incompatible (B) with FC and RD, whereas mapping C and D were compatible only with the FC or RD, respectively. The same mappings were also obtained for Hebrew days (see <ref type="figure" coords="8,432.40,486.80,22.20,7.53">Fig. 6b</ref>). As in Experiment 1, hand posture was assessed in two separated daily sessions. Moreover, mappings of the same language were assessed subsequently within the same session. Hence, as in Experiment 2, participants had to complete four different blocks in each session (e.g., day one: A-B-E-F; day two: C-D-G-H). The order of the eight mappings was counterbalanced across participants. To control for possible motor speed differences among fingers and hand posture, participants performed a baseline reaction time task, as in Experiment 1 and 2.</p><p>Finally, at the end of the second session the personal finger counting strategy was assessed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Discussion</head><p>In Experiment 3, we explored whether the spatial mapping of non-numerical ordinal information relies (a) on FC, (b) on RD or (c) on a combination of both. Results showed that the preferential mapping resulted when both FC and RD routines were compatible, thus supporting the alternative (c). While previous investigations with bilingual participants showed an impact of language direction on the spatial representation of ordinal information in bilingual participants <ref type="bibr" coords="10,90.37,664.19,84.80,7.53" target="#b67">(Shaki &amp; Gevers, 2011)</ref>, the present study shows that also FC contributes to shape this spatial representation. Indeed, participants responded faster in A than in all the other mappings with the English days, while they responded faster in G with the Hebrew days. Altogether, these results show that both FC and RD play a critical role in the spatial representation of non-numerical ordinal information. More specifically, these results indicate that the representation of non-numerical ordinal sequences on the hand space relies on multiple visuomotor routines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">General discussion</head><p>Robust evidence points to directional visuomotor routines, such as finger counting and reading habit, as relevant for representing numerical information in space. However, no study has so far investigated the routine on which we rely on more. The present study addressed this issue by requiring bilingual participants, reading either from left-to-right or right-to-left, to map ordinal information to all fingers of their right dominant hand. Results of Experiments 1 and 2 show that the spatial representation of numerical information relies mainly on finger counting routine. Moreover, results of Experiment 2 indicate that this representation is not sensitive to the contextual manipulation of the numerical code (Arabic vs verbal numerals; Hebrew vs English number words), suggesting that it is stored in long-term memory as a consequence of the repeated visuomotor activity throughout the lifespan. Finally, Experiment 3 unveils that the spatial representation of non-numerical ordinal sequences, i.e., days of the week, relies on both finger counting and reading habit. This suggests that when ordinal information is not consolidated with space through a specific visuomotor routine, the representation of abstract ordered information relies on different directional experiences (finger counting, reading direction) depending on the stimuli and task at hand. Overall, the present study shows that the spatial representation of ordinal sequences on the hand space relies on directional routines and, particularly, on finger counting. These findings might have broad implications for current models of numerical representation and, more generally, for an experience-based view of cognition.</p></div>

Using a number-to-finger mapping task, in the present study we show that participants responded faster to Arabic digits and to number words when numerical information was mapped according to participants' finger counting routine. These findings are in line with evidence suggesting a strong influence of finger counting routine on SNAs on the hand space <ref type="bibr" coords="11,166.39,141.15,77.25,7.53" target="#b17">(Di Luca et al., 2006)</ref> and, more generally, they provide further evidence for a reliable contribution of FC on the spatial representation of numbers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="11,231.02,162.07,52.76,7.53" target="#b25">Fischer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,32.71,172.55,87.91,7.53" target="#b57">Riello &amp; Rusconi, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,120.62,172.55,158.97,7.53">). However, while Di Luca et al. (2006</ref> reported a predominance of the finger counting mapping over the orientation of the MNL, recently <ref type="bibr" coords="11,181.53,193.47,102.26,7.53" target="#b57">Riello and Rusconi (2011)</ref> found that both FC and MNL need to be congruently oriented for generating faster mappings. These apparently contrasting findings might result from different task settings and from a different emphasis on fingers representation. Indeed, while in the study of <ref type="bibr" coords="11,32.71,245.80,101.07,7.53" target="#b57">Riello and Rusconi (2011)</ref> participants were required to classify parity numbers with two fingers only (i.e., index and middle fingers), the present study adopted a five keys response setting resulting in increased finger discriminability. The larger emphasis on the hand space, due to the use of all fingers of the hand, thus might have led to greater contribution of FC.</p><p>A current debate in the literature concerns whether the direction followed in finger counting is influenced by cultural factors, such as reading direction, or by biological factors, such as handedness (see, for a discussion, <ref type="bibr" coords="11,134.31,339.91,76.36,7.53" target="#b56">Previtali et al., 2011)</ref>. Indeed, the finger counting strategy is to a certain degree culturally shared, since young children can observe and learn from their peers how to use fingers for counting <ref type="bibr" coords="11,124.04,371.32,85.49,7.53" target="#b5">(Bender &amp; Beller, 2012)</ref>. On these grounds, some authors proposed that the visuomotor scanning linked to reading and writing direction might provide a critical cue for the starting point and the overall direction of the finger counting routine (see <ref type="bibr" coords="11,67.69,413.16,87.69,7.53" target="#b40">Lindemann et al., 2011)</ref>. At the same time, however, also handedness represents a sound candidate for shaping finger counting direction, with previous studies indicating a tight association between the starting hand of FC and hand dominance (see for a discussion <ref type="bibr" coords="11,63.32,454.99,76.53,7.53" target="#b56">Previtali et al., 2011)</ref>. In a sample of right-handed bidirectional readers we found that more than 80% of participants started to count with the thumb of the right hand and proceeded to the little finger (with the same order followed on the left hand). Critically, this percentage replicates those reported in previous study with a Western population <ref type="bibr" coords="11,142.64,507.26,83.49,7.53" target="#b17">(Di Luca et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,229.94,507.26,53.85,7.53;11,32.71,517.75,19.78,7.53" target="#b63">Sato &amp; Lalain, 2008)</ref>, without any apparent difference due to cross-cultural variability between the two samples. Therefore, since our participants were all right handers, our findings speak in favor of a critical role of handedness in the starting point of FC and call into question whether eye scanning associated with reading direction can be an important factor in the origin of FC direction (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,241.45,570.08,42.35,7.53;11,32.71,580.51,45.11,7.53" target="#b40">Lindemann et al., 2011)</ref>. Indeed, these findings show that RD only partially interacts with FC, establishing the primacy of the latter on the hand mapping of ordinal information. The fact that the preferential mapping of numerical information was not dependent on hand posture and on language direction provides evidence for a hand-centered representation.</p><p>It is worth considering that our study involved Israeli bilingual participants who usually show less lateralized SNAs compared to monolingual readers ; but see for more recent studies documenting a classic left-to-right SNARC: <ref type="bibr" coords="11,251.04,674.68,32.69,7.53;11,32.71,685.11,47.73,7.53" target="#b67">Shaki &amp; Gevers, 2011</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" coords="11,119.96,685.11,101.33,7.53" target="#b69">Tzelgov &amp; Zohar-Shai, 2014</ref>). Yet, in Experiment 1, we found that mappings compatible with the prototypical finger-counting strategy led to fastest reaction times. This finding replicates those by Di <ref type="bibr" coords="11,120.08,716.51,67.65,7.53" target="#b17">Luca et al. (2006)</ref> observed in a sample of Italian left-to-right readers. The preference for finger-counting mappings was extended in Experiment 2 to Hebrew and English number words. Thus, although SNAs in bilingual readers assessed by standard bimanual classification tasks depend on language manipulation , our findings indicate that when the hand space is emphasized, numbers are better mapped according to FC rather than RD routine. Finally, in Experiment 3, the compatibility between FC and RD determined the fastest mapping for non-numerical ordered information. A recent study found a standard left-to-right SNARC effect with English letters and a reversed right-to-left SNARC effect with Hebrew letters in bilingual participants <ref type="bibr" coords="11,325.42,151.64,85.53,7.53" target="#b67">(Shaki &amp; Gevers, 2011)</ref>. Our study adds to this evidence by showing that, under specific circumstances (i.e., when participants are required to map ordered information on fingers), the representation of ordered sequences relies on the interplay between both FC and RD.</p><p>One may wonder whether such interplay was determined by participants' expertise with two differently oriented languages. Bilingual readers were indeed selected as the preferential group to investigate the representational flexibility induced by language manipulation. Nevertheless, results from Experiment 3 might be likely generalized to a monolingual sample. First, English and Hebrew days of the week were presented in different blocks, making unlikely that the results obtained were due to a rapid language switching effect. Second, if the strength of reading skills accounted for our findings, we should expect language to modulate compatibility effects. Yet, despite the overall difference in RTs, English and Hebrew words led to similar compatibility effects. However, it is still possible that reading direction may only influence the spatial mapping of non-numerical ordered information in bilinguals, because they can read and write along opposite directions. Thus, no potential conflict between reading direction and finger counting may emerge in a group of monolingual readers. Future research is needed to address this intriguing possibility, involving ideally groups of monolingual participants reading either in a left-to-right or in a right-to-left oriented language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">A helping hand putting in order</head><p>What makes numbers specials is that they convey different meanings, among which the most salient are the cardinal meaning, referring to the numerosity of a set, and the ordinal meaning, indicating the relative position of a certain item within a set.

While the impact of finger counting routine on SNAs is rather unsurprising and supported by different findings, the influence of this practice on the representation of nonnumerical ordinal sequences may not be taken for granted. In fact, one may question how fingers would be helpful for representing non-numerical ordinal information in space.</p><p>We propose that finger counting support to ordinal representation might be grounded on the one-to-one correspondence principle, strengthened by the systematic association between a specific finger and a specific ordinal position during counting.

It might be therefore possible that the more we actively use parts of our body in the response setting, the more we rely on inner and bodily representations grounded on an egocentric sensory-motor schema. Intrinsic features of finger counting routines would make them resistant to situational requirements. Finger counting routine is indeed practiced early in development, it is reinforced by observational exposure and by self-practice, and it is characterized by an exact one-to-one correspondence between a specific finger and a specific number.</p><p>On the contrary, in Experiment 3 a significant influence of situational factors was found. More specifically the privileged mapping of non-numerical ordinal information was determined by a combination of both reading and finger counting direction, thus resulting in an impact of hand posture. Overall, these findings highlight the more flexible representation of non-numerical ordinal sequences, showing how embodied factors interact more generally with situational requirements.</p><p>To conclude, we suggest that the need for putting in order multiple information in everyday life makes our cognitive system highly capable of representing abstract ordered information, by adjusting previous directional experience (finger counting, reading direction) to current requirements imposed by the task at hand.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,42.52,280.99,520.05,6.03;4,42.52,289.55,520.02,6.03;4,42.52,298.11,224.88,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Procedure of Experiment 1 for (a) the experimental block with numbers and for (b) the motor baseline task.
