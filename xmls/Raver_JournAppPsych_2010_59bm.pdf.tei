<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite scholars' and practitioners' recognition that different forms of workplace harassment often co-occur in organizations, there is a paucity of theory and research on how these different forms of harassment combine to influence employees' outcomes. We investigated the ways in which ethnic harassment (EH), gender harassment (GH), and generalized workplace harassment (GWH) combined to predict target individuals' job-related, psychological, and health outcomes. Competing theories regarding additive, exacerbating, and inuring (i.e., habituating to hardships) combinations were tested. We also examined race and gender differences in employees' reports of EH, GH, and GWH. The results of two studies revealed that EH, GH, and GWH were each independently associated with targets' strain outcomes and, collectively, the preponderance of evidence supported the inurement effect, although slight additive effects were observed for psychological and physical health outcomes. Racial group differences in EH emerged, but gender and race differences in GH and GWH did not. Implications are provided for how multiple aversive experiences at work may harm employees' well-being.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite several decades of research and organizational interventions aimed at promoting inclusive workplaces, the evidence suggests that discrimination and hostile behavior may actually be on the rise. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2009) received 95,402 discrimination charge filings during the 2008 fiscal year, an all-time high and a 15% increase from 2007; this came after a 9% increase between 2006 and 2007. Although most research has focused on access discrimination (i.e., invalid differential access to jobs) or treatment discrimination as it relates to the fairness of organizational procedures <ref type="bibr" coords="1,208.48,449.96,76.49,8.10;1,48.68,460.96,88.87,8.10" target="#b47">(Greenhaus, Parasuraman, &amp; Wormley, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,140.00,460.96,83.48,8.10" target="#b107">Terborg &amp; Ilgen, 1975)</ref>, there is growing evidence that treatment discrimination is often interpersonal in nature. It takes the form of verbal harassment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,250.50,482.96,38.24,8.10;1,48.68,493.96,119.83,8.10" target="#b98">Schneider, Hitlan, &amp; Radhakrishnan, 2000)</ref>, exclusion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,237.58,493.96,47.26,8.10" target="#b56">Ibarra, 1992)</ref>, microaggressions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,137.76,504.96,62.14,8.10" target="#b105">Sue et al., 2007)</ref>, bullying (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,263.79,504.96,24.93,8.10;1,48.68,515.96,61.85,8.10" target="#b41">Fox &amp; Stallworth, 2005)</ref>, and incivility (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,189.05,515.96,99.70,8.10;1,48.68,526.96,70.64,8.10" target="#b28">Cortina, Magley, Williams, &amp; Langhout, 2001)</ref>, all of which hamper the full integration of targets.</p><p>Harassment can be based on various identity group characteristics (e.g., race, gender, disability, religion, national origin, sexual orientation) but can also come in the form of vexatious behavior that is not overtly linked to one's membership in a particular identity group (e.g., bullying, incivility, aggression). Evidence has increasingly demonstrated that targets of harassment often experience multiple forms of mistreatment. For example, gender harassment co-occurs with reports of ethnic harassment <ref type="bibr" coords="1,505.29,372.95,41.44,8.10;1,306.68,383.95,49.00,8.10" target="#b12">(Berdahl &amp; Moore, 2006)</ref>, incivility <ref type="bibr" coords="1,398.83,383.95,83.77,8.10" target="#b69">(Lim &amp; Cortina, 2005)</ref>, and harassment against sexual minorities <ref type="bibr" coords="1,399.78,394.95,89.23,8.10" target="#b67">(Konik &amp; Cortina, 2008)</ref>. To date, however, research has primarily examined targets' outcomes for each type of harassment in isolation (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,437.22,416.95,109.52,8.10" target="#b21">Buchanan &amp; Fitzgerald, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.68,427.95,74.90,8.10" target="#b69">Lim &amp; Cortina, 2005</ref>, for exceptions), perhaps because theoretical models of the stress process within which research on harassment outcomes has been grounded (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,437.73,449.95,90.93,8.10" target="#b59">Kahn &amp; Byosiere, 1992)</ref> provided little guidance about how two or more forms of harassment collectively harm targets. Studying different forms of harassment in isolation does not fit with the complexity of many employees' experiences, and it risks leading to erroneous conclusions about the combined impact of harassment. Thus, as others have argued (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.68,515.95,108.94,8.10" target="#b90">Rospenda &amp; Richman, 2004a)</ref>, there is a real need for theory and research that increases our understanding of targets' overall experiences of workplace harassment.</p><p>In the current research, we drew from three competing theories regarding how people respond to aversive conditions and investigated whether three forms of harassment collectively have additive, exacerbating, or inuring (i.e., habituating to hardships) effects on targets' strain outcomes. Specifically, we studied ethnic harassment, threatening verbal or exclusionary behavior that has an ethnic component and is directed at a target individual because of the individual's ethnicity <ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.64,625.95,84.53,8.10" target="#b98">(Schneider et al., 2000)</ref>; gender harassment, crude verbal and physical behaviors that convey hostile, offensive, and sexist attitudes <ref type="bibr" coords="1,420.75,647.95,121.98,8.10;1,306.68,658.95,85.42,8.10" target="#b36">(Fitzgerald, Drasgow, Hulin, Gelfand, &amp; Magley, 1997)</ref>; and generalized workplace harassment, behaviors that create a hostile, intimidating, or offensive work environment but which are not overtly based on legally protected characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,360.42,691.95,170.71,8.10" target="#b92">(Rospenda, Richman, Ehmke, &amp; Zlatoper, 2005</ref>; cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.68,702.95,91.85,8.10" target="#b17">Bowling &amp; Beehr, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,401.73,702.95,144.99,8.10" target="#b34">Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf, &amp; Cooper, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.68,713.95,90.94,8.10" target="#b64">Keashly &amp; Jagatic, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,399.85,713.95,87.81,8.10" target="#b78">Neuman &amp; Baron, 1998)</ref>. Prior work has focused on understanding how one's demographics predict whether one experiences harassment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,216.96,86.96,71.77,8.10;2,48.68,97.96,19.58,8.10" target="#b12">Berdahl &amp; Moore, 2006)</ref>; our primary focus was on understanding the outcomes experienced by targets of multiple forms of harassment. A secondary purpose of this research was to investigate race and gender differences in employees' reports of all three forms of harassment, thereby contributing to the literature on "double jeopardy" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.68,152.96,47.90,8.10" target="#b7">Beale, 1970)</ref> and also testing propositions regarding the subtle nature of contemporary discrimination through general mistreatment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,93.27,174.96,55.42,8.10" target="#b9">Berdahl, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.87,174.96,52.80,8.10" target="#b26">Cortina, 2008)</ref>. We first review the relevant literature on workplace harassment, followed by our theoretical rationale and hypotheses, and then present the results of two studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Workplace Harassment</head><p>Harassment refers to vexatious behavior experienced as a result of one or more personal attributes, many of which are covered by Title VII of the 1964 U.S. Civil Rights Act. More formally, this is defined in the following way:</p><p>Harassment is verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability, or that of his/her relatives, friends, or associates, and that (i) has the purpose or the effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; (ii) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance; or (iii) otherwise adversely affects an individual's employment opportunities. (U.S. Equal <ref type="bibr" coords="2,274.92,375.88,9.18,7.20;2,64.68,385.88,200.72,7.20">Employment Opportunity Commission, 1993, pp. 51268 -51269)</ref> Consistent with this, we use the term social identity harassment to refer to harassing behaviors that reference one's membership in a group that comprises a component of one's social identity (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.68,438.96,89.19,8.10" target="#b3">Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,140.85,438.96,83.55,8.10" target="#b106">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1985)</ref>, and we focused on gender and ethnic harassment in our study. Gender harassment (GH) has been treated as one aspect of sexual harassment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.24,460.96,27.99,8.10;2,48.68,471.96,58.32,8.10" target="#b40">(Fitzgerald et al., 1988)</ref>, but unlike sexual coercion or unwanted sexual attention, it "conveys hostility devoid of any explicit sexual motive" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,69.96,493.96,115.17,8.10">(Lim &amp; Cortina, 2005, p. 484)</ref>. Evidence has consistently shown that GH occurs more frequently than attempts to garner sexual cooperation, and when sexualized forms of harassment do occur, they are nearly always coupled with gender harassment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.68,537.96,143.23,8.10" target="#b99">(Schneider, Swan, &amp; Fitzgerald, 1997)</ref>. Ethnic harassment (EH) encompasses both hostile comments about a target individual's ethnic group and exclusion of the target from work-related or social interactions because of the individual's ethnicity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.76,570.96,38.99,8.10;2,48.68,581.96,42.86,8.10" target="#b98">(Schneider et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Although research historically focused only on the GH experiences of women and the EH experiences of racial/ethnic minorities, there is mounting evidence that this may be overly narrow.

Similarly, with regard to EH, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.36,75.95,89.06,8.10" target="#b98">Schneider et al. (2000)</ref> found across four studies with ethnically diverse samples that racial minority and Caucasian individuals reported similarly high rates of EH (i.e., 40 -60% of samples) and that the measure of EH functioned equally well across races (for similar results, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.27,119.95,55.18,8.10;2,306.68,130.95,120.37,8.10" target="#b15">Bergman, Palmieri, Drasgow, &amp; Ormerod, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.33,130.95,90.97,8.10" target="#b96">Ruggiero &amp; Major, 1998)</ref>. Thus, in the present studies, we assessed all employees' experiences of GH and EH.</p><p>There has also been much recent attention to generalized workplace harassment (GWH; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,399.56,174.95,107.44,8.10" target="#b91">Rospenda &amp; Richman, 2004b)</ref>. A variety of labels have been used to refer to this broader category of mistreatment, including generalized workplace harassment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.68,207.95,82.89,8.10" target="#b92">(Rospenda et al., 2005)</ref>, workplace aggression <ref type="bibr" coords="2,476.96,207.95,69.76,8.10;2,306.68,218.95,19.53,8.10" target="#b77">(Neuman &amp; Baron, 1996)</ref>, workplace bullying <ref type="bibr" coords="2,413.64,218.95,91.12,8.10">(Rayner &amp; Hoel, 1997)</ref>, incivility <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.68,229.95,106.15,8.10" target="#b1">(Andersson &amp; Pearson, 1999)</ref>, emotional abuse <ref type="bibr" coords="2,480.74,229.95,65.99,8.10;2,306.68,240.95,63.26,8.10" target="#b63">(Keashly, Harvey, &amp; Hunter, 1997)</ref>, and social undermining <ref type="bibr" coords="2,473.09,240.95,73.62,8.10;2,306.68,251.95,46.60,8.10" target="#b32">(Duffy, Ganster, &amp; Pagon, 2002)</ref>. Regardless of the label, these constructs encompass behaviors that create a hostile, intimidating, or offensive work environment, although the motivation for the mistreatment is often ambiguous. GWH may be instigated by a number of different factors, including prejudicial attitudes or a willingness to get ahead by harming those with lower social power (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.76,306.95,52.10,8.10" target="#b9">Berdahl, 2007)</ref>. This means that GWH may not appear discriminatory, but if certain identity groups report significantly higher levels of GWH than others, this would suggest that GWH is used as a subtle form of treatment discrimination (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,411.79,350.95,52.04,8.10" target="#b26">Cortina, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.13,350.95,44.91,8.10" target="#b95">Rowe, 1990)</ref>. To date, the evidence suggests that gender differences in GWH are small (i.e., a meta-analysis found an r ϭ Ϫ.05 relationship between gender and GWH; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,374.79,383.95,87.75,8.10" target="#b17">Bowling &amp; Beehr, 2006)</ref>, and little research has examined racial differences in GWH. Evidence on the relationships between experiencing GWH and other forms of harassment is sparse, and thus there is a need for current research on relationships among GWH, EH, GH, gender, and race.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Studies: Rationale and Hypotheses</head><p>All forms of workplace harassment are detrimental to employees' well-being. Indeed, one of the most consistent findings from the literature is that harassment represents a potent interpersonal stressor (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,357.98,504.96,82.84,8.10" target="#b36">Fitzgerald et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,443.61,504.96,53.90,8.10" target="#b62">Keashly, 1998)</ref>, and as such it produces strain outcomes such as poor job attitudes (e.g., dissatisfaction) and negative job-related behaviors (e.g., withdrawal), as well as poor psychological and physical health (e.g., anxiety, depression, dissatisfaction, headaches, neck strain). There are competing theories regarding the exact processes through which occupational stressors result in strain outcomes (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,515.16,570.96,31.57,8.10;2,306.68,581.96,52.93,8.10" target="#b59">Kahn &amp; Byosiere, 1992</ref>, for a review), but common to these theories is the understanding that stressors produce immediate physiological responses (e.g., increased heart rate and blood pressure), which may result in longer term strain <ref type="bibr" coords="2,404.12,614.96,93.30,8.10" target="#b8">(Beehr &amp; Newman, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,499.61,614.96,47.12,8.10;2,306.68,625.96,20.50,8.10" target="#b57">Jex &amp; Beehr, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,330.35,625.96,74.64,8.10" target="#b61">Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978)</ref>. This theoretical foundation has been useful for describing the underlying processes and diverse range of outcomes experienced by targets of harassment (cf. .</p><p>Consistent with these more general theories about stressorstrain relationships, research has shown that each type of workplace harassment predicts target strain outcomes as expected, including poor job attitudes, high levels of work withdrawal, turnover intentions, mental health symptoms, and high levels of physical symptoms or somatic complaints (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,222.45,75.96,66.26,8.10;3,48.68,86.96,20.50,8.10" target="#b17">Bowling &amp; Beehr, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,71.58,86.96,81.21,8.10" target="#b98">Schneider et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,155.20,86.96,105.74,8.10" target="#b113">Willness, Steel, &amp; Lee, 2007)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes of Workplace Harassment Types in Combination</head><p>As we indicated earlier, our primary goal was to move beyond tests of the outcomes associated with each type of harassment in isolation, as such an approach does not reflect the multifaceted nature of many employees' harassment experiences. Take, for example, the case of a woman of minority ethnicity who is subjected to ethnic jokes and then also experiences gendered insults. How would the additional experience of GH influence her job attitudes and well-being? Would the hostile experiences add together such that experiencing two forms of harassment is twice as harmful as experiencing one form? Or might her experience with EH trigger coping responses that steel her against the damage that might otherwise be caused by GH, such that the combined effects are no worse than experiencing just EH? Alternatively, could the strain she experiences as a result of EH weaken her psychological reserves and render her hypersensitive to further abuse, such that experiencing both forms of harassment makes her strain outcomes exponentially worse? To complicate matters further, social identity harassment is typically coupled with GWH <ref type="bibr" coords="3,205.03,647.96,79.81,8.10" target="#b69">(Lim &amp; Cortina, 2005)</ref>, so this employee may also be subjected to personal insults, rumors, social exclusion, and/or other forms of mistreatment that are not clearly linked to the woman's ethnic or gender identity. Does this generalized form of harassment affect the strain that she experiences above and beyond EH and GH, given that it is not explicitly sexist or racist and thus may be interpreted as personally moti-vated? Unfortunately, there is currently very little in the literature that can help us to answer these important questions.</p><p>To provide theoretical guidance, we drew from theories in clinical, cognitive, and health psychology regarding how people respond to multiple aversive conditions. Drawing from this broader set of theoretical foundations was essential because the stressor-strain theoretical frameworks that dominate the harassment literature are unable to predict or explain how two or more types of mistreatment will combine to influence targets. They specify the stress process for a single stressor, with little attention to the processes involved when experiencing combinations of stressors <ref type="bibr" coords="3,341.32,197.83,95.18,8.10" target="#b59">(Kahn &amp; Byosiere, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,440.15,197.83,79.55,8.10" target="#b71">Love &amp; Beehr, 1981)</ref>. What emerged from our literature review were competing theories that offered three very different, yet equally plausible, predictions regarding how two or more forms of harassment would predict targets' outcomes. Rather than simply choosing a favorite theory, we followed <ref type="bibr" coords="3,355.19,253.23,72.24,8.10">Chamberlin's (1890</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,431.47,253.23,16.18,8.10" target="#b25">Chamberlin's ( /1965</ref> recommendations to propose multiple working hypotheses as a way to combat bias and gain insights into complex phenomena. Details on each competing hypothesis follow.</p><p>The first explanation for the ways in which forms of harassment combine to influence targets emerges from the clinical literature on major life stressors. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,383.70,319.64,94.27,8.10" target="#b53">Holmes and Rahe (1967)</ref> theorized that the negative impact of life stressors is additive. Some events may be more detrimental than others (e.g., death of a friend vs. financial troubles), but it is possible to determine the level of expected psychological strain by assessing how many life stressors an individual has experienced in the recent past <ref type="bibr" coords="3,480.25,374.98,66.49,8.10;3,306.68,386.05,20.50,8.10" target="#b53">(Holmes &amp; Rahe, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,329.41,386.05,77.82,8.10" target="#b85">Rahe &amp; Arthur, 1978)</ref>. The greater the number of severe life stressors that one has recently experienced, the greater is the negative impact on one's psychological and physical health. A number of organizational studies have supported this additive conceptualization of aversive events (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,471.46,430.32,75.27,8.10;3,306.68,441.39,20.50,8.10" target="#b6">Barnett &amp; Brennan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,330.35,441.39,111.75,8.10" target="#b21">Buchanan &amp; Fitzgerald, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,445.27,441.39,81.27,8.10" target="#b69">Lim &amp; Cortina, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,529.71,441.39,12.75,8.10;3,306.68,452.46,132.21,8.10" target="#b97">Russell, Altmaier, &amp; van Velzen, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,441.88,452.46,46.11,8.10" target="#b114">Zohar, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>This theory and evidence provide a solid foundation for proposing that forms of harassment may combine in an additive fashion to predict targets' outcomes. This additive effect suggests that when targets experience different forms of harassment, each new type of harassment (i.e., EH, GH, GWH) adds to the target individual's level of negative strain outcomes. It suggests that each type of harassment will have separate negative effects and that there are no interactive combinations. Support for this hypothesis would be seen if, for example, the increase in negative outcomes experienced as a function of undergoing GH is the same for individuals who have experienced low levels of EH as it is for individuals who have experienced high levels of EH. More formally, we state the following hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 4a: Different types of harassment combine additively to predict target outcomes. The addition of a second and/or third type of harassment predicts significant variance in outcomes beyond that predicted by one type alone.</p><p>The second hypothesis, which we derived from psychological adaptation theory <ref type="bibr" coords="3,373.33,680.76,54.82,8.10" target="#b51">(Helson, 1964)</ref> within cognitive psychology, is that although GH, EH, and GWH are independently damaging to individuals, their combination is not significantly worse for target individuals' outcomes than the effects of one type of harassment alone. According to <ref type="bibr" coords="4,129.51,75.96,60.69,8.10" target="#b51">Helson's (1964)</ref> theory, when people are exposed to a set of stimuli, they develop an adaptation level to those stimuli such that any future exposure to similar stimuli produces an indifferent (or minimal) response. Furthermore, as new experiences become integrated into one's adaptation level, one's tolerance may increase over time. Adaptation-level theory has been widely applied to and supported in a number of domains ranging from sensory perception to affective reactions, learning, personality, and group dynamics (see <ref type="bibr" coords="4,184.88,164.60,51.44,8.10" target="#b2">Appley, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,238.52,164.60,46.14,8.10" target="#b51">Helson, 1964</ref>, for reviews), as well as organizational research <ref type="bibr" coords="4,225.71,175.68,63.04,8.10;4,48.68,186.76,106.47,8.10" target="#b18">(Bowling, Beehr, Wagner, &amp; Libkuman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,158.14,186.76,122.10,8.10" target="#b108">Thau, Aquino, &amp; Bommer, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to workplace harassment, adaptation-level theory would suggest that targets of harassment may develop an adaptation level to the first form of harassment that they experience. Then, when a second form of harassment is encountered, such individuals may experience only a minimal change in strain outcomes because they have already inured themselves against mistreatment. This is not to say that each form of harassment is not independently damaging. Target individuals will experience strain outcomes from a single form of harassment (regardless of its form), but second or third forms of harassment may not add to these negative effects because they represent stimuli that are similar to those involved in one's adaptation level. We refer to this adaptation to aversive harassment stimuli as the inurement effect, as the term inure means "to accustom to accept something undesirable" (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2008) or "to toughen or harden by exercise; accustom; habituate" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,249.74,363.92,38.98,8.10;4,48.68,374.99,240.04,8.10;4,48.68,386.06,19.37,8.10">(Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, 1989)</ref>. Thus, the term inurement appropriately characterizes harassment as being undesirable and not neutral, even if an apparent lack of worsening outcomes suggests that people habituate to multiple experiences of it. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 4b: Different types of harassment combine to predict targets' outcomes in an inuring fashion such that two or more types of harassment in conjunction do not predict significant incremental variance in target outcomes compared with one type alone.</p><p>Our third and final possibility for how combinations of harassment influence target outcomes is that experiencing one type of harassment heightens people's state of arousal, making it more likely that they appraise new situations as threatening. We label this the exacerbation effect, as it suggests that instead of adding together in a linear fashion, the effects of additional types of harassment will magnify each other. This proposition emerges from energetical theories <ref type="bibr" coords="4,149.48,592.21,59.36,8.10" target="#b52">(Hockey, 1997)</ref> according to which stressful conditions such as harassment require people to tap into their energy reserves in order to maintain work performance. When they do, they constrain the energy resources available to respond to future stressors. If additional stressors are encountered in such a state, attempts to adapt to those stressors will be particularly taxing, resulting in exponentially greater costs to their well-being <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.62,669.69,55.06,8.10" target="#b52">(Hockey, 1997)</ref>. When applied to the study of multiple forms of harassment, threshold theories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,220.28,680.76,68.45,8.10;4,48.68,691.83,16.80,8.10" target="#b42">Freseh &amp; Okonek, 1984</ref>) similarly lead us to expect an exacerbation effect. When individuals experience just one form of harassment, they exhibit short-term reactions that subside as long the individuals do not experience prolonged exposure to the stressor. However, when individuals are exposed to multiple forms of harassment, they reach their biological or psychological breaking point or threshold, at which point they will show signs of a "sleeper effect" and exhibit more severe strain outcomes.</p><p>Given that our three competing explanations exhaust the combinatorial possibilities for the outcomes associated with experiencing multiple forms of harassment, support for the exacerbation effect would exist if both alternatives-Hypotheses 4a (additive effect) and 4b (inurement effect)-are falsified. We now turn to the demographic predictors of harassment.</p></div>

There was no evidence that women experienced higher EH or that racial minorities experienced higher GH. Given that this is the only study on double jeopardy for harassment amidst a long history of inconsistent evidence in the larger discrimination literature, we believe it is important to provide further evidence.</p><p>Similarly, there is debate about whether women and racial minorities are at increased risk of experiencing GWH. According to <ref type="bibr" coords="4,315.91,614.95,51.73,8.10" target="#b26">Cortina (2008)</ref>, public expression of sexist and racist beliefs has lessened in recent decades, yet they still exist and have merely become more subtle (i.e., modern discrimination). Cortina theorized that GWH is used selectively against women and racial minorities as a subtle form of modern discrimination that has the effect of psychologically and physically wearing down individuals. However, prior research on gender differences (see <ref type="bibr" coords="4,504.81,680.95,41.93,8.10;4,306.68,691.95,50.17,8.10" target="#b17">Bowling &amp; Beehr's, 2006</ref>, meta-analysis) and race differences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,521.99,691.95,24.74,8.10;4,306.68,702.95,65.34,8.10" target="#b41">Fox &amp; Stallworth, 2005)</ref> in GWH has not shown much evidence for gender or race differences.

As expected, EH was negatively related to commitment (␤ ϭ Ϫ.19, p Ͻ .01) and job satisfaction (␤ ϭ Ϫ.28, p Ͻ .01) and positively related to turnover intentions (␤ ϭ .16, p Ͻ .05). Consistent with Hypothesis 2 (Model 2), GH was also negatively related to commitment (␤ ϭ Ϫ.17, p Ͻ .01) and job satisfaction (␤ ϭ Ϫ.23, p Ͻ .01) and positively related to turnover intentions (␤ ϭ .28, p Ͻ .01). Thus, the results revealed separate main effects for EH and GH on targets' attitudinal and behavioral outcomes.</p><p>Hypothesis 4 proposed competing hypotheses for how EH and GH would collectively predict targets' strain outcomes, that is,, additive effects (Hypothesis 4a), inurement effects (Hypothesis 4b), or exacerbating effects in the absence of either of these two possibilities.

This interaction was plotted on the basis of the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" coords="6,192.46,512.46,82.76,8.10" target="#b0">Aiken and West (1991)</ref>, as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="6,88.34,523.46,31.46,8.10" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.

This interaction is most consistent with the inurement effect (Hypothesis 4b) because when EH experiences were high, whether one experiences GH did not significantly change the observed relationship between EH and organizational commitment. That is, the negative relationship of GH with commitment (Model 2) became nonsignificant when EH was high.</p><p>When EH and GH were entered simultaneously (Model 3), only EH was significantly related to job satisfaction (␤ ϭ Ϫ.24, p Ͻ .01). The two forms of harassment collectively accounted for 9% of the variance in job satisfaction compared with 8% for EH alone (Model 1), which evidenced a very small additive effect (Hypothesis 4a). For turnover intentions, only GH maintained a significant relationship with turnover intentions (␤ ϭ .26, p Ͻ .01) when both GH and EH were entered simultaneously (Model 3). This combined model accounted for 8% of the variance, which was the same as GH alone (Model 2), thus providing support for an inurement effect (Hypothesis 4b).</p><p>Post hoc analyses were conducted to determine whether race interacted with EH to predict outcomes, whether gender interacted with GH to predict outcomes, and whether any EH ϫ GH inter- .86 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we first established that EH and GH independently predicted organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions before investigating our focal question regarding how EH and GH combined to predict these same outcomes. Our results evidenced the strongest support for the inurement effect, which emerged for two of the three outcomes. High levels of EH led to consistently low commitment, regardless of one's levels of GH. For turnover intentions, high levels of GH predicted turnover intentions regardless of the extent to which one also experienced EH. Thus, both EH and GH substituted for each other's effects on target strain. In addition to these inuring effects, we also found a slight additive effect for job satisfaction; EH and GH together accounted for 1% incremental variance in job satisfaction beyond EH. There was no support for the exacerbation effect across any of the variables.</p><p>With regard to the demographic predictors of EH and GH, participants of minority race were more likely than Caucasian participants to experience EH, consistent with most prior work <ref type="bibr" coords="8,306.68,363.81,92.15,8.10" target="#b12">(Berdahl &amp; Moore, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,401.13,363.81,77.90,8.10" target="#b15">Bergman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,481.34,363.81,65.37,8.10;8,306.68,375.10,19.37,8.10" target="#b41">Fox &amp; Stallworth, 2005)</ref>. However, gender differences in GH did not emerge as significant nor was the interaction between gender and race significant in predicting GH. An examination of the pattern of means in <ref type="figure" coords="8,342.85,408.99,36.22,8.10" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref> suggests that gender differences in GH may be more complex than previously discovered, but this interaction did not attain significance and should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, in this organization, women constituted the numeric majority; thus, men of minority race comprised the group of double minorities, which may have influenced the results. In planning a second investigation, therefore, we were interested in studying people from a large range of different organizations, industries, and occupations, which would enable us to draw better conclusions about typical patterns of demographic differences.</p><p>As with all research, there were limitations associated with Study 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2 Method</head><p>Participants and procedures. In our second study, our hypotheses were tested with data derived from two samples, each of which contained employees from a diverse range of organizations and occupations.</p><p>Sample 1. Our first sample of employees were surveyed online through the Study Response Project, which facilitates research by connecting researchers with participants who have agreed to participate in online survey research. This allowed us to collect data across time while also guaranteeing participants' anonymity, which is beneficial for studying sensitive topics. Adults in the United States who were employed full-time and worked with at least three colleagues were recruited to participate in a study called "Job Attitudes and Experiences at Work." Equal numbers of male and female participants were recruited. We oversampled racial/ ethnic minorities to the maximum extent possible, which was approximately 7% each for African American, Asian, and Hispanic participants (21% total). Of the 1,483 working adults who were invited to participate in our two-part study, 786 (53%) completed a first online survey that contained the harassment questions and demographics. Participants were recruited for a second online survey with the dependent variables four weeks later, which was completed by 605 people (77% return response rate). Of these, 586 participants provided sufficient data to retain in the final sample. This sample was 61% female, and the average age was 39 years old. The racial/ethnic representation was 83% Caucasian, 7% African American, 5% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 1% other races. All industry categories were represented, with approximately half of the sample collectively being from health care (12%), education (12%), sales (9%), government (7%), business/financial (5%), and production/manufacturing (4%).</p><p>Sample 2. A second sample was recruited to enhance the sample size and increase the numbers of racial minorities and men. Employed business students at an eastern U.S. university were recruited to participate in a two-part study called "Job Attitudes and Experiences at Work" in exchange for extra credit. Only individuals who were currently employed in an environment with at least three colleagues were eligible to participate in this study. The first survey, answered by 207 participants, contained the harassment questions and demographics, and the second survey, which was administered four weeks later and completed by 156 individuals (75%), contained the dependent variables. After removing seven surveys on account of incomplete data, our final sample consisted of 149 participants. This sample was 55% male, with an average age of 20 years. The racial distribution was 66% Caucasian, 14% Asian, 8% African American, 8% Hispanic, and 4% other races. All industry sectors were represented, with over half of the sample being from the sales (11%), legal (11%), food services (11%), business and financial (9%), and education (9%) sectors.</p><p>These two samples were examined for differences prior to combining them. Consistent with our goal of diversifying the sample, the second sample contained a significantly higher proportion of men, ϭ Ϫ.13; p Ͻ .01, and racial minorities, ϭ .17; p Ͻ .01, but did not differ in terms of organizational tenure, F(732) ϭ .53, ns. Given the 23 industry codes, respondents could choose from and the nature of the samples, it was not surprising to find that they differed in terms of industries represented ( ϭ .38; p Ͻ .01). In addition, as expected, the student sample worked fewer hours each week, F(731) ϭ 82.34, p Ͻ .01. We conducted all analyses, with hours worked as a covariate, and also conducted all analyses for the samples separately. Both sets of analyses produced the same pattern of results, so we combined the samples for additional power and diversification. After determining that there were no significant differences among the racial minority groups in their rates of EH or GH, we created a dichotomous racial minority/Caucasian variable for hypothesis testing. The final combined racial/gender group representation consisted of the following: 324 Caucasian women, 265 Caucasian men, 102 minority women, and 44 minority men.</p><p>Measures.

Therefore, Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported for five of the six dependent variables, and Hypothesis 3 was fully supported.

When EH, GH, and GWH were entered simultaneously, GWH remained significant, whereas GH and EH did not, except in one case. None of the two-way interactions were significant, but three-way interactions emerged for organizational commitment (␤ ϭ Ϫ.43, p Ͻ .05) and job satisfaction (␤ ϭ Ϫ.58, p Ͻ .01). <ref type="figure" coords="11,57.68,460.96,35.01,8.10" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref> reveals that the lowest levels of organizational commitment were observed when GWH was high.

For turnover intentions, only GWH retained significance when all three types of harassment were entered simultaneously (␤ ϭ .27, p Ͻ .01); this model accounted for 7% of the variance in turnover intentions, which was the same as for GWH alone (Model 3). For life satisfaction, only GWH retained significance (␤ ϭ Ϫ.23, p Ͻ .01), but EH and GH accounted for 1% additional variance compared with GWH alone. For physical symptoms, GWH was again the only significant predictor (␤ ϭ .21, p Ͻ .01), and EH and GH accounted for 1% additional variance compared with GWH alone. Finally, for anxiety and depression, both GWH (␤ ϭ .32, p Ͻ .01) and EH (␤ ϭ .09, p Ͻ .05) were significant, and all three forms of harassment accounted for 1% additional variance compared with GWH alone. In sum, whereas results involving commitment, satisfaction, and turnover intentions provide support for an inurement effect (Hypothesis 4b), the psychological and physical health variables demonstrated slight additive effects (Hypothesis 4a).</p><p>Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether race interacted with EH to predict outcomes, whether gender interacted with GH to predict outcomes, and whether the EH ϫ GH two-way interactions were further qualified by gender or race in three-way interactions.

First, the results showed that EH, GH, and GWH each had significant main effects on the target strain outcomes, with the exception of life satisfaction, which was only related to GWH. The three-way interactions for organizational commitment and job satisfaction showed that the two forms of social identity harassment (EH and GH) combined in a manner consistent with the inurement effect and that neither had negative effects beyond high GWH. The inurement effect was also supported for turnover intentions. However, for psychological and physiological well-being, the three types of harassment showed slight (1%) additive effects over GWH alone. We interpret these results in light of Study 1 in more detail below.</p><p>The evidence on racial and gender predictors of workplace harassment was also largely consistent with the results of Study 1. Participants of racial minority reported significantly higher levels of EH than did Caucasian participants, yet women were no more likely than men to experience GH. With regard to demographic differences in GWH, the results showed a surprising reversal such that Caucasians reported higher levels of GWH than did participants of minority race. No gender differences in GWH emerged.</p><p>Strengths of this study included the time-lagged methodology, where the independent and dependent variables were collected a month apart to reduce common-method variance <ref type="bibr" coords="14,268.02,669.95,16.57,8.10;14,48.68,680.95,88.79,8.10" target="#b83">(Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986)</ref> and the use of validated scales for all constructs. Our sample was also organizationally and occupationally diverse, so our conclusions are less likely to be driven by context-specific roles, norms, policies, or cultural effects that may skew results from a single setting. This study is not without its limitations, however. Although we drew from broad samples of employees in variety of organizations, our sample does not represent any known population, and we cannot draw conclusions regarding representativeness to the larger U.S. population. We also cannot draw any causal conclusions from this study, but the time-lagged design does help to provide some additional confidence in the results.

Therefore, we developed and tested competing hypotheses about whether EH, GH, and GWH combine in additive, exacerbating, or inuring ways to predict target individuals' job-related, psychological, and health outcomes. A secondary goal was to contribute to the ongoing debates about whether both race and gender influence employees' likelihood of experiencing EH, GH, and GWH. We conducted a field study of 226 employees in a single organization and a time-lagged study of 735 employees from a range of organizations, occupations, and industries.</p><p>Overall, the evidence from these studies shows that EH, GH, and GWH predominantly combine in inuring ways to predict target strain outcomes. The inurement effect was supported for jobrelated outcomes in both studies. For target individuals' psychological and physical health outcomes in Study 2, there was slight support for additive effects, yet these accounted for only 1% additional variance in all cases. There was no support for the exacerbation effect in either study.</p><p>These results suggest several conclusions and insights for future research. It is first important to keep in mind that each type of harassment is independently associated with a host of negative strain outcomes. With that said, it only takes a single type of harassment to predict low organizational commitment, poor job satisfaction, and/or turnover intentions; secondary or tertiary types of harassment did not further reduce job-related attitudes and turnover intent. These results fit with adaptation-level theory <ref type="bibr" coords="15,269.76,471.95,15.19,8.10;15,48.68,482.95,40.60,8.10" target="#b51">(Helson, 1964)</ref> in that people subconsciously adjust to workplace harassment by establishing an adaption level, which may prevent them from experiencing additive harm when faced with a second type of harassment. Experience with one form of social identity harassment may trigger coping strategies where people buffer themselves against further harm by discounting harassment as being due to prejudicial attitudes. Experiences with one form of social identity harassment may signal that the environment tolerates bias. Once targets perceive the environment tolerates biased treatment, they become prepared for (or at least not surprised by) additional incidents of bias, even if they involve a different social identity group. Indeed, when individuals attribute negative experiences to prejudice, it lessens the negative impact of those experiences on their psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" coords="15,214.76,625.95,73.86,8.10;15,48.68,636.95,19.37,8.10" target="#b29">(Crocker &amp; Major, 1989)</ref>. However, future research is needed to better understand the psychological mechanisms that allow target individuals to steel themselves against damage from multiple types of harassment.</p><p>Our results suggest that inuring oneself against the harmful effects of additional harassment experiences may be more difficult when GWH is involved. Adaptation-level theory suggests that adaptation to aversive stimuli will only occur when the new stimulus is judged to be similar; if it is substantially different from one's existing adaptation level, it will trigger a stronger response <ref type="bibr" coords="15,306.68,87.14,53.77,8.10" target="#b51">(Helson, 1964)</ref>. This may explain why EH and GH had similar effects, whereas GWH predicted outcomes beyond social identity harassment. Because EH and GH can both be attributed to prejudice, they are similar phenomena from an attributional perspective, whereas GWH may represent a substantially different stimulus. Because GWH is a subtle form of mistreatment that masks underlying motives, it is not as easily attributed to bias. Its ambiguous nature may be damaging as a result of the cognitive load of rumination about why one is being targeted (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="15,490.38,176.69,56.36,8.10;15,306.68,187.88,19.37,8.10" target="#b84">Porath &amp; Erez, 2007)</ref>. In addition, GWH is not currently illegal in the United States, whereas GH and EH are; therefore, anxiety about the lack of recourse for addressing GWH may make it especially detrimental.</p><p>Inurement effects may be most prominent for job-related outcomes because any form of harassment violates employees' expectations for dignified treatment, leading employees to disengage from the organization for tolerating the egregious acts <ref type="bibr" coords="15,520.98,266.23,25.75,8.10;15,306.68,277.43,110.67,8.10" target="#b55">(Hulin, Fitzgerald, &amp; Drasgow, 1996)</ref>. Employees may cope by inuring themselves against future harassment while looking for another job. By comparison, because of the negative emotions and frustration that accompany each instance of harassment, employees may not be able to fully inure themselves against psychological and physiological harm from each instance, thereby leading to small additive effects on health (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="15,438.80,344.59,107.94,8.10;15,306.68,355.78,20.50,8.10" target="#b4">Banyard, Williams, &amp; Siegel, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,330.17,355.78,130.58,8.10" target="#b31">Dohrenwend &amp; Dohrenwend, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>The three forms of harassment were moderately correlated in both studies. Prior work has also shown co-occurrence between forms of harassment; one recent literature review cited several studies that found correlations ranging from .32 to .61 between GH, EH, and GWH <ref type="bibr" coords="15,381.90,411.75,97.43,8.10">(Berdahl &amp; Raver, in press</ref>). These moderate correlations may be occurring for a few reasons. First, an environment that tolerates one form of harassment may also tolerate other forms of harassment, consistent with <ref type="bibr" coords="15,447.47,445.33,76.77,8.10">Hulin et al.'s (1996)</ref> argument that harassment is "a manifestation of an organizational culture that permits dominance of certain groups of employees over other groups" (p. 133). Thus, if power struggles and status imbalances are permitted within the organizational environment, mistreatment of all types may occur. A second possible reason is that targets of harassment may be experiencing events that have to do with more than one identity group membership at a time, leading to "double counting." Although the EH and GH measures ask questions that specifically refer to one's social identity group, it is possible that some forms of mistreatment are ambiguous and attributed to more than one cause. For example, some experiences of GWH (e.g., "withheld information from you") might also be interpreted as being due to one's race or gender, leading to greater overlap between these constructs. A third possibility is that something about the targets makes them more susceptible to harassment or more likely to perceive (and report) harassment. For example, it is possible that a personality variable such as targets' negative affectivity may explain a portion of the covariation among harassment types. Negative affectivity has rarely been included as a covariate in EH or GH research, so we did not include this construct in our studies, but future work on individual differences would be useful. Overall, we call for research on these issues, particularly through the use of qualitative methodologies (e.g., diaries, critical incidents) that would uncover the experiential and/or attributional reasons for the overlap between forms of harassment.</p><p>Another key finding is that the relationships between each type of harassment and target participants' outcomes were not qualified by race or gender. This fits with conclusions from prior research, which has shown that GH <ref type="bibr" coords="16,143.26,130.96,104.59,8.10" target="#b14">(Bergman &amp; Drasgow, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,149.32,141.96,68.92,8.10" target="#b82">Piotrkowski, 1998)</ref> and EH <ref type="bibr" coords="16,249.73,141.96,38.99,8.10;16,48.68,152.96,43.24,8.10" target="#b98">(Schneider et al., 2000)</ref> have negative outcomes on targets when experienced, regardless of whether the target is of a minority or Caucasian race, a woman or a man.</p><p>With regard to our second goal of contributing to the literatures on double jeopardy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,141.95,196.96,46.25,8.10" target="#b7">Beale, 1970)</ref> and contemporary discrimination (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,96.25,207.96,52.28,8.10" target="#b9">Berdahl, 2007)</ref>, with an investigation of demographic predictors of EH, GH, and GWH, the results showed that participants of minority race reported significantly higher levels of EH than did Caucasian participants. This finding confirms the assertion that racial minorities are at increased risk for being targeted with EH <ref type="bibr" coords="16,83.00,262.96,94.73,8.10" target="#b12">(Berdahl &amp; Moore, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,180.90,262.96,80.48,8.10" target="#b15">Bergman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,264.55,262.96,24.17,8.10;16,48.68,273.96,61.77,8.10" target="#b41">Fox &amp; Stallworth, 2005)</ref>. However, we did not find that racial minorities experienced higher levels of GWH. Indeed, Caucasians actually reported higher levels of GWH than did individuals of minority race. In addition, there were no gender differences in GH or GWH. Taken together, this set of results does not support the double jeopardy hypothesis, nor does it support <ref type="bibr" coords="16,204.53,328.95,61.34,8.10" target="#b26">Cortina's (2008)</ref> arguments about the selective use of GWH for racial and gender discrimination. Future research is necessary to further investigate this issue and to better understand the specific nature of GWH experiences reported by members of different racial and gender groups.</p><p>The nonsignificant gender differences in GH deserve further comment. Our results, which are consistent with some past research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,95.01,416.95,78.15,8.10" target="#b89">Richman et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,175.71,416.95,80.02,8.10" target="#b93">Rospenda et al., 2006)</ref>, beg the question of why men reported similar levels of GH as women. It is possible that frequency levels appear similar because women underreport harassment events because they have habituated to them. Another possibility is that because men might not expect to experience GH, these experiences are more salient and reported because expectancy-incongruent information is recalled more readily (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,90.02,493.95,78.92,8.10" target="#b5">Bargh &amp; Thein, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,171.00,493.95,94.92,8.10" target="#b103">Stangor &amp; McMillan, 1992</ref>). Yet another possibility is that men experience GH from men and women, whereas women primarily experience GH from men only (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,63.62,526.95,123.94,8.10" target="#b11">Berdahl, Magley, &amp; Waldo, 1996)</ref>. Gender differences in GH may be more likely to emerge if we examine only man-on-woman harassment and woman-on-man harassment. Gender differences in GH may also be at least in part a function of how one measures GH. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,66.99,570.95,98.68,8.10" target="#b12">Berdahl and Moore (2006)</ref> found gender differences in GH, and this may be because rather than using a typical behavioral frequency measure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,147.09,592.95,87.56,8.10" target="#b38">Fitzgerald et al., 1995)</ref>, they used a measure in which frequency rates were multiplied by subjective ratings of the extent to which each harassing act was perceived as bothersome. Doing so creates stronger gender differences because women generally perceive harassing acts to be more bothersome than do men (see <ref type="bibr" coords="16,117.64,647.95,166.98,8.10;16,48.68,658.95,30.82,8.10">Rotundo, Nguyen, and Sackett's, 2001, metaanalysis)</ref>. However, frequency alone is a robust predictor of target strain, even if participants deny that harassing experiences were bothersome <ref type="bibr" coords="16,93.55,680.95,97.39,8.10" target="#b10">(Berdahl &amp; Aquino, 2009)</ref> or fail to label the experiences as harassment <ref type="bibr" coords="16,131.91,691.95,156.82,8.10;16,48.68,702.95,19.58,8.10" target="#b72">(Magley, Hulin, Fitzgerald, &amp; DeNardo, 1999)</ref>; moreover, stressful experiences are often inaccurately appraised because people engage in psychological defense and ra-tionalization mechanisms that keep them from admitting that the experiences were harmful <ref type="bibr" coords="16,408.90,87.40,105.88,8.10" target="#b68">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. Future research is necessary to examine whether gender differences in GH are influenced by habituation, disconfirmation of expectations, nature of the perpetrator, and/or measurement. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,477.59,120.42,3.50,4.95">4</ref> From a practical standpoint, our results indicate that both social identity harassment and GWH continue to take place in organizations, with significant implications for target individuals. Although the mean levels of harassment were relatively low overall, all types of harassment predicted outcomes with important organizational consequences. For example, as seen in <ref type="figure" coords="16,456.37,190.50,34.37,8.10" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>, the organizational commitment scores reported by individuals who experienced low levels of EH, GH, and GWH (one standard deviation below the mean on each) were 36% higher than those reported by individuals who experienced high levels of EH, GH, and GWH (5.42 and 3.96, respectively). For job satisfaction, the difference was 30%. Given meta-analytic evidence regarding the relationships of job satisfaction with performance (r ϭ .30; Judge, Thoresen, <ref type="bibr" coords="16,323.22,282.10,80.28,8.10" target="#b58">Bono, &amp; Patton, 2001)</ref>, and both commitment (r ϭ Ϫ.23) and satisfaction (r ϭ Ϫ.19) with turnover <ref type="bibr" coords="16,446.81,293.55,99.93,8.10;16,306.68,304.99,19.37,8.10" target="#b48">(Griffith, Hom &amp; Gaertner, 2000)</ref>, these differences can translate into significant financial losses for organizations. Furthermore, targets of harassment report productivity decrements and may retaliate with deviant behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="16,306.68,339.32,86.39,8.10" target="#b113">(Willness et al., 2007)</ref>. Thus, even moderately low levels of harassment should concern managers because of the personal and organizational harm that harassment creates.</p><p>Given our evidence that even a single type of harassment is sufficient to predict poor job attitudes and turnover intentions, organizations need to adopt both proactive and reactive measures to reduce it to the greatest extent possible. Harassment of all types is likely to occur in organizations that perpetuate arbitrary (i.e., not job-related) status hierarchies, that are characterized by competition and self-interest, and that fail to intervene effectively when such harassment does occur <ref type="bibr" coords="16,411.74,453.76,57.14,8.10" target="#b9">(Berdahl, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,471.78,453.76,74.93,8.10;16,306.68,465.20,21.00,8.10">Berdahl &amp; Raver, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,330.38,465.20,88.73,8.10" target="#b81">Pearson &amp; Porath, 2005)</ref>.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">For readers who are interested in average levels of social identity harassment and/or the average levels of workplace harassment across all three scales, we providedFigures 4d and 4e, respectively. There were no significant race differences, gender differences, or interactions that emerged for these summary indices. See also footnote #1 on scoring.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">The numeric representation of men and women, and likewise the numeric representation of Caucasians and racial minorities, may also influence rates of GH and EH. For example, men may be most likely to report high levels of GH when they are numerically underrepresented in the organizational context, and women's GH rates may be highest when they are underrepresented (cf.<ref type="bibr" coords="16,389.45,694.64,44.22,7.20" target="#b49">Gruber, 1998)</ref>. SeeBerdahl and Raver (in press)   for a more detailed discussion of how the organizational context may influences rates of harassment.</note>
