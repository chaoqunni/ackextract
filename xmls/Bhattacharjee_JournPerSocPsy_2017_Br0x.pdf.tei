<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Profit-seeking firms are stereotypically depicted as immoral and harmful to society. At the same time, profit-driven enterprise has contributed immensely to human prosperity. Though scholars agree that profit can incentivize societally beneficial behaviors, people may neglect this possibility. In 7 studies, we show that people see business profit as necessarily in conflict with social good, a view we call anti-profit beliefs. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that U.S. participants hold anti-profit views of real U.S. firms and industries. Study 3 shows that hypothetical organizations are seen as doing more harm when they are labeled "for-profit" rather than "non-profit," while Study 4 shows that increasing harm to society is viewed as a strategy for increasing a hypothetical firm's long-run profitability. Studies 5-7 demonstrate that carefully prompting subjects to consider the long run incentives of profit can attenuate anti-profit beliefs, while prompting short run thinking does nothing relative to a control. Together, these results suggest that the default view of profits is zero-sum. While people readily grasp how profit can incentivize firms to engage in practices that harm others, they neglect how it can incentivize firms to engage in practices that benefit others. Accordingly, people's stereotypes of profit-seeking firms are excessively negative. Even in one of the most market-oriented societies in history, people doubt the contributions of profit-seeking industry to societal progress.</p></div>

Plays like Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and modern films like It's a Wonderful Life, Wall Street, and The Wolf of Wall Street routinely depict profit-seeking capitalists and organizations as ruthless and depraved <ref type="bibr" coords="1,252.79,480.04,35.25,7.91;1,48.00,491.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b88">(Ribstein, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,70.90,491.04,42.53,7.91" target="#b101">Stein, 1979)</ref>. On the other hand, it would be difficult to find a film celebrating how profit-seeking firms contribute to societal progress.

In short, there are clear negative stereotypes about for-profit firms and corresponding beliefs about their effects on society <ref type="bibr" coords="1,494.93,425.34,51.12,7.91;1,306.00,436.48,68.11,7.91" target="#b1">(Aaker, Vohs, &amp; Mogilner, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, these negative associations with profit may result in perverse outcomes. For instance, Daniel Pallotta ran Pallotta TeamWorks, an organization that successfully raised money for nonprofit charities whose causes included AIDS and cancer research. But while it raised money for charities, Pallotta Team-Works was a for-profit company. Once this became public knowledge, the resulting outrage forced charities to stop hiring Pallotta TeamWorks, ultimately causing the company to fold.

In other words, the perceived incompatibility of profit-seeking and societal good turned a win-win scenario into a lose-lose scenario.</p><p>We propose that people tend to hold anti-profit beliefs, characterized by perceptions that profit-seeking is necessarily in conflict with beneficial outcomes for consumers and society.

Consequently, people readily consider the bad outcomes created by profit while failing to recognize the potential for profit to incentivize societally beneficial behaviors. As such, profit may be seen as necessarily coming at the expense of others. We predict that people will exhibit anti-profit beliefs and regard profit seeking as inherently harmful unless they are explicitly prompted to consider how profit can incentivize good behaviors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zero-Sum Market Exchange: When Firm Intentions Correspond to Market Outcomes</head><p>Concerns about the harmful effects of profit-seeking motives are well-founded in many individual transactions. In any one-off transaction between a buyer and a seller, the benefits are zero-sum: even though both sides may benefit from the exchange, more benefit to one party means less benefit to the other. For example, when a dealership sells an individual car to a buyer, its profits come directly at the expense of the buyer. Because the only way for a seller to increase profit in a zero-sum exchange is to capture more value from the buyer, profit incentivizes socially harmful behavior. For instance, the seller can profit from deceiving the buyer about the quality of the car and making them overpay.</p><p>In such zero-sum settings, vigilance against excessive seller selfishness can help buyers avoid harm. Since people are strongly motivated to avoid being duped or exploited in these situations , awareness of others' selfish motives triggers defensive measures against persuasive tactics or potential dishon-This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>esty <ref type="bibr" coords="3,66.06,77.04,108.42,7.91" target="#b16">(Campbell &amp; Kirmani, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,178.04,77.04,109.99,7.91" target="#b32">Fein, Hilton, &amp; Miller, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,88.04,91.46,7.91" target="#b39">Friestad &amp; Wright, 1994</ref>).

However, these intuitions may be misleading when intentions do not align with outcomes. As the case of Dan Pallotta illustrates, neglecting the possibility that profit can motivate beneficial outcomes may have steep societal costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Positive-Sum Market Exchange: When Profit-Seeking Can Motivate Good Behavior</head><p>In competitive markets, motives for profit may not reliably indicate harmful outcomes for others. Because firm profits in these contexts are based on voluntary choices by consumers, deceiving or overcharging consumers may be a short-sighted strategy. For instance, a firm with deceptive practices will develop a bad reputation and lose repeat and future business. A firm that sets excessively high prices or offers poor quality products will lose business to competitors with lower prices or higher quality products. Accordingly, to attract their own customers, firms must either charge lower prices or make better products than their competitors. To continue to profit while charging lower prices, firms must find ways to produce and distribute products more cheaply by conserving resources and reducing inefficiency. To profit by making better products, firms must understand what consumers need and innovate to develop products that they will value. In a competitive environment, profits can thus motivate firms to make consumers and society better off by providing incentives for conservation and innovation.</p><p>Importantly, firms' incentives to create value depend on consumers' choices. When consumers are free to choose the products they value most, their demands determine the products that firms supply and the prices they can charge. In this sense, competitive markets align the selfish motives of profit-seeking firms with outcomes that are valued by society, and profit reflects the "net contribution that the firm makes to the social good" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,234.06,484.04,50.11,7.91" target="#b7">(Arrow, 1973)</ref>.</p><p>The societal benefits of profit thus depend on market conditions that enable consumers to make meaningful choices. Facing choices between different offerings from competing firms lets consumers find the products and services that best match their preferences and to pay more for those they value most (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,206.28,539.04,81.77,7.91" target="#b14">Botti &amp; Iyengar, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,550.04,54.46,7.91" target="#b78">Mochon, 2013)</ref>. Across repeated exchanges, consumers can identify the firms they like best and share this information with others. Hence, firms must develop better offerings and better reputations than their competitors in order to maximize their long-term profitability: strong competitive and reputational constraints in markets incentivize firms to provide consumers what they value. However, if consumers face few choices, cannot tell good products from bad products, or cannot share reputational information about firms, then firms can profit without needing to engage in good business practices that benefit society. In markets with weak competitive constraints, firms can profit from bad practices that harm society.</p><p>Of course, markets are not perfectly competitive and consumers are not perfectly informed. While economists may debate the prevalence of market conditions under which firms can profit from good vs. bad practices <ref type="bibr" coords="3,133.58,704.03,92.87,7.91" target="#b3">(Akerlof &amp; Shiller, 2015)</ref>, they agree that supply and demand typically determine prices. In other words, consumers usually have choices, which in turn dictates how firms must behave in order to profit. Thus, profit also provides firms with good incentives to create value for consumers and society <ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.00,110.03,54.24,7.91" target="#b18">(Caplan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,363.24,110.03,82.60,7.91" target="#b43">Gordon &amp; Dahl, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

Because firms' selfish intentions seem aligned with harmful outcomes for others, this possibility may be highly intuitive and easy for people to understand. On the other hand, firms' selfish intentions do not seem aligned with beneficial outcomes for others, disrupting this intuitive link. The competitive constraints that force firms to produce good outcomes for others in order to profit depend on a complex array of situational factors that may be difficult to appreciate and may not be apparent from people's experiences.</p><p>The bad side of profit is readily accessible. Most people participate in a vast array of market exchanges throughout their lives, but experience them mostly from the consumer perspective. Each one of these experiences is zero-sum when considered in isolation: the more a firm profits from a given purchase, the less value consumers receive. Even when people do experience the selling side of exchange, it is most often when they resell something they own, such as a car or a house. Notably, these situations are also zerosum and lack any component of value creation: resellers do not invent anything new or produce anything more efficiently to benefit buyers. Earning more profit depends only on obtaining a higher price from the buyer. Additionally, because sellers typically know more about the actual quality of the goods they own than buyers, most people's limited experiences with selling will make them aware that harmful practices like deception can increase their profits at the expense of the buyer.</p><p>Thus, people have firsthand experience with the bad side of profit. However, the way profit incentivizes firms to conserve and innovate is nearly invisible. Few people directly experience the process of investing in the production and distribution of products that consumers value in order to earn profits. In a single transaction, the firm's profit is dictated by how much it can charge. But the competitive forces limiting the prices a firm can charge are a complex set of factors that are not apparent from that transaction. The repeated exchanges and investments that led the firm to innovate and efficiently produce its current marketplace offerings are far removed from any single transaction. Consumers may never directly experience their influence in shaping current market outcomes. Thus, the way profits incentivize firms to create value are far less accessible, and may require effortful abstract thought to fully appreciate.</p><p>Hence, relative to the harmful incentives posed by profit, incentives for beneficial behavior are counterintuitive and largely invis-This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>ible in everyday experience, resulting in a stark asymmetry.

Because the good incentive effects of profit are not immediate and direct, they may be consistently neglected when people judge individual market exchanges in isolation (cf., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,219.86,165.04,68.19,7.91" target="#b51">Idson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,48.00,176.04,66.98,7.91" target="#b54">Jones et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,117.97,176.04,155.08,7.91" target="#b67">Legrenzi, Girotto, &amp; Johnson-Laird, 1993)</ref>.

Moreover, this result runs counter to the positive correlation between profit and expert measures of societal impact for the same firms, demonstrating that these perceptions might be inaccurate. Study 2 demonstrates similar effects for entire industries, suggesting that this negative association does not depend on particular prominent firms. Study 3 suggests that the same organizational practices are judged as more harmful in the presence of a profit motive, suggesting profit seeking is seen as inherently harmful.

Subjects rated their perceptions of 40 firms sampled from the Fortune 500 list of highest-grossing public corporations. The purpose of using Fortune 500 firms was twofold: First, because these are publicly held firms, their actual revenues and profits are observable. Second, many of these firms are sufficiently recognizable that subjects would have opinions about their value to society. We randomly sampled 8 firms from each quintile of the list, subject to the constraints that the firms were recognizable to nonexperts and profitable in the past year. A short description was included with each firm (e.g., "Kraft Foods Inc. manufactures and markets snacks, confectionery, and quick meal products worldwide.").

Subjects then rated their perceptions of firm profit ("How much profit do you think this business made on average (of businesses in general) in the last year?"; 0 ϭ zero or less, 5 ϭ a lot more than average).

Subjects then indicated whether they thought these profits came from bad business practices: "Is this amount of profit deserved or not?" (1 ϭ less than what is deserved, 3 ϭ more than what is deserved); "Do profits for [this business] (if any) come at the expense of others?"; "Do these profits (if any) result from lack of sufficient competition?"; yes/no). Finally, they indicated the perceived motives underlying these practices: "What are the most important motives of those who run this business?" (1 ϭ to serve society or consumers, 3 ϭ to make money, regardless of the effect on others).</p></div>

Substituting the log of actual profit for perceived profit yielded a similarly strong correlation, r(38) ϭ Ϫ.57, p Ͻ .001. 1 Given that ratings of perceived profit and societal value have some measurement error, these results suggest that, in the aggregate, profit is viewed as a virtual proxy for societal harm.</p><p>We examined individual differences by calculating withinsubject correlations between perceived profit and societal value.

Subjects' perceptions of the negative association between firm profit and good societal outcomes cannot be explained by this measure of market imperfection (i.e., insufficient constraints on bad business practices). As a final robustness check, we tested our data against the measures of overall societal impact most commonly used within the CSR literature: the annual ratings released by Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini (KLD; <ref type="bibr" coords="7,104.82,220.04,105.42,7.91" target="#b19">Cheng, Hong, &amp; Shue, 2014)</ref>. These measures are intended to capture a firm's total impact on society along dimensions of community relations, corporate governance, diversity, environmental impact, employee relations, human rights, and product characteristics. In our sample of firms, overall KLD scores had small positive correlations with actual log income, r(38) ϭ .20, p ϭ .242, actual profit margin, r(38) ϭ .16, p ϭ .329, and perceived profit, r(38) ϭ .07, p ϭ .681, consistent with both the direction and the approximate magnitude of the positive relationship between good societal impact and profitability identified in prior research <ref type="bibr" coords="7,207.15,319.04,77.19,7.91" target="#b81">(Orlitzky et al., 2003)</ref>. Somewhat unintuitively, overall KLD scores also had a weak positive correlation with perceived societal value, r(38) ϭ .21, p ϭ .199. However, the partial correlation between perceived profit and perceived societal value, controlling for KLD ratings, was slightly stronger, r(35) ϭ Ϫ.65, p Ͻ .001, and the same was true of our measures of bad business practices. Thus, the negative association between firm profit and perceived societal value appears excessively negative relative to analyses using actual expert measures of overall societal impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>As expected, our findings demonstrate a strong negative association between perceptions of firms' profit and firms' value to society. These judgments contradict the positive association between actual firm profit and objective expert measures of firm societal value, casting doubt on the notion that subjects' negative stereotypes of profit-seeking firms reflect those firms' actual impact on society (cf., <ref type="bibr" coords="7,123.96,522.04,49.12,7.91" target="#b55">Jussim, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Our supporting measures provide further evidence of our account: subjects perceived greater profits as less deserved and coming more at the expense of others. These findings are consistent with beliefs that market exchange is zero-sum, whereby profit can only motivate harmful outcomes. However, we found some heterogeneity: while many more subjects exhibited the expected negative association, about a tenth of our subjects actually held pro-profit beliefs. One possibility is that this heterogeneity is rooted in subjects' experiences with or exposure to news about particular firms, rather than their beliefs about firm profit in general. We conducted Study 2 to assess this possibility and improve several features of our measurement strategy in Study 1.</p></div>

If the negative association between perceived profit and perceived societal value depends on certain firms, then we would expect a much weaker correlation for judgments of entire industries. Conversely, if profit is viewed as inherently harmful, as we predict, then we should still observe a strong negative relationship between perceived profit and perceived societal value. We expected that even entire industries perceived as more profitable would be seen as less valuable to society.</p><p>Study 2 also used a more concrete measurement strategy than Study 1, allowing us to address some additional objectives: (a) To measure beliefs about specific harmful business practices, beneficial business practices, and externalities, or costs or benefits imposed on society as byproducts of a firm's business practices. While the responses in Study 1 suggest a zero-sum view of profit, subjects did not have the opportunity to differentiate between good and bad business practices, both of which might be present for many firms. By including more concrete measures of both good and harm, we allowed subjects to give more nuanced responses. (b) To ensure that the results of Study 1 are not an artifact of question order. For example, judging profit first may have influenced ratings of societal value. Hence, we counterbalanced the order of presentation for all items in this study. (c) To test whether economic knowledge or political ideology can explain anti-profit beliefs. We included these potential moderators at the end of the study.</p></div>

Next, subjects rated each industry on perceptions of specific harmful business practices ("This type of business overcharges consumers."; "This type of business underpays employees."; "This type of business takes safety shortcuts."; "This type of business exploits loopholes in regulations."), beneficial practices ("This type of business provides valuable goods and services."; "This type of business contributes important innovations to society."), and negative and positive externalities ("This type of business makes our culture worse."; "This type of business makes cultural contributions to society."). All eight measures had the same response options (disagree, not sure, agree).

[false]; <ref type="bibr" coords="8,162.70,121.63,87.64,7.91" target="#b62">Klein &amp; Buturovic, 2011)</ref>, while the remaining four items were created to apply to profit more specifically (e.g., "If a company makes a profit selling some product and another company does not, the profitable company must be giving the consumer a worse deal."

Finally, subjects reported their political orientation ("Which description best represents your political ideology?"; 1 ϭ very liberal, 2 ϭ liberal, 3 ϭ moderate, 4 ϭ conservative, 5 ϭ very conservative, 6 ϭ libertarian, 7 ϭ not sure). Responses of "not sure" were recoded to "moderate" for analysis. Only four subjects reported libertarian beliefs, and including these responses separately, recoding them to "very conservative," or omitting them from analyses did not affect our results. One subject did not answer the question and was omitted from these analyses.</p></div>

Mean profit and societal value ratings of industries were highly negatively correlated, r(38) ϭ Ϫ.60, p Ͻ .001 (see <ref type="figure" coords="8,83.84,358.44,29.55,7.91" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). These results held at the individual level in a linear mixed-effects regression: higher ratings of profit were associated with lower ratings of societal value, even with random slopes for profit for each subject, b ϭ Ϫ0.114, t ϭ 5.91, p Ͻ .001.</p><p>To examine individual differences, we calculated within-subject correlations between perceived profit and societal value. Overall, 49% (n ϭ 45 of 92) of subjects exhibited a significant negative correlation, indicating significantly greater anti-profit beliefs than would be expected by chance (one-sided binomial p Ͻ .001). Only 8% (n ϭ 7) of subjects showed a significant positive correlation, no greater than chance expectations (p ϭ .177). Thus, anti-profit beliefs are more pronounced in judgments of entire industries. 2 Question order had no effect.</p><p>Bad business practices. Perceived profit was also correlated with perceptions of specific harmful business practices. More profitable industries were rated as overcharging consumers more, r(38) ϭ .69, p Ͻ .001, taking more safety shortcuts, r(38) ϭ .35, p ϭ .029, and exploiting more regulatory loopholes, r(38) ϭ .63, p Ͻ 001. Perceived industry profit was negatively but not significantly related to underpaying workers more, r(38) ϭ Ϫ.17, p ϭ .289. All significant results held and supported predictions in individual-level analyses using linear mixed-effects models (see <ref type="table" coords="8,48.00,603.68,27.44,7.91" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Even across industries, subjects associated profit with harmful business practices.</p><p>Good business practices. We also examined whether people view profit as motivating beneficial business practices. More profitable industries were rated as providing fewer valuable goods and services, r(38) ϭ Ϫ.39, p ϭ .013, and profitability was negatively but not significantly associated with contributing important innovations, r(38) ϭ Ϫ.12, p ϭ .468. As before, all results held in linear mixed-effects regressions (see <ref type="table" coords="8,186.45,692.77,27.12,7.91" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). In addition to associating profit with more harmful practices, subjects also viewed profit as motivating fewer beneficial business practices.</p><p>Bad vs. good externalities. Next, we tested whether antiprofit judgments also apply to broader externalities on society. Higher profits were positively associated with making culture worse, r(38) ϭ .67, p Ͻ .001, and negatively but not significantly associated with making cultural contributions, r(38) ϭ Ϫ.20, p ϭ .217. Both effects were significant in analyses using linear mixedeffects models (see <ref type="table" coords="8,378.38,144.00,26.38,7.91" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Subjects viewed profits as related to more harmful and fewer beneficial externalities on society.</p><p>Individual economic knowledge and political ideology. Finally, we examined two potential moderators of anti-profit beliefs. Contrary to expectations, our economic knowledge measure was weakly positively correlated with anti-profit beliefs (i.e., individual subjects' correlations of profit and societal value; r(90) ϭ .13, p ϭ .23). No individual items were significantly related to anti-profit beliefs. These results provide no evidence that antiprofit beliefs relate to general economic knowledge on this measure within this population.</p><p>Political ideology was weakly correlated with individual anti-profit beliefs, r(90) ϭ Ϫ.16, p ϭ .140, such that self-described conservatives had weaker anti-profit beliefs than self-described liberals. More importantly, a set of regressions found that the intercept for anti-profit beliefs remained significant for subgroups of subjects along the political spectrum: liberal respondents (responses Ͻ3), b ϭ 0.26, t(27) ϭ 4.89, p Ͻ .001, moderates and those unsure of their beliefs (responses ϭ 3), b ϭ 0.26, t(35) ϭ 5.17, p Ͻ .001, and conservative and libertarian respondents (responses Ͼ3), b ϭ 0.14, t(26) ϭ 2.34, p ϭ .027. All subgroups exhibited significant anti-profit beliefs when examined separately. Thus, variation in anti-profit beliefs cannot be explained by political ideology alone, and anti-profit beliefs appear robust across the political spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our findings indicate a strong and robust negative association between perceived profit and perceived societal value. These findings cannot be explained by measurement artifacts such as question order, items that imprecisely define societal value, or items that do not allow two-sided responses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>As expected, across four different organizations, subjects viewed the presence of a profit motive as more harmful than its absence, even with business practices held constant, indicating the presence of anti-profit beliefs. A profit motive was also thought to reduce an organization's ability to achieve its objectives. In light of prior findings that for-profit corporations are seen as less warm but more competent than nonprofit organizations <ref type="bibr" coords="11,214.50,539.04,69.66,7.91" target="#b1">(Aaker et al., 2010)</ref>, it is possible that in this study, the perceived incompatibility between profit motives and motives for societal good overwhelmed any perceived competence advantage ascribed to forprofit firms.</p><p>Importantly, these findings also help establish the direction of these effects. People held anti-profit beliefs even relative to a baseline in which motives were not specified, supporting the presence of anti-profit beliefs, but not the presence of pro-nonprofit beliefs.</p><p>Though our theorizing does not directly address the conditions under which people infer the presence of profit motives, it may be the case that organizations are not assumed to have selfish profit motives when they have good practices that plausibly reflect nonprofit motives. The weaker effects within the artisan crafts scenario, in which the organization's practices were not perceived as favorably as those in the other scenarios, indicate that assump-tions about firm motives might depend on how good or bad their practices seem. Study 4 used a different approach to further investigate how good or bad practices affect inferences about firm motives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4: Intended Societal Harm Is Thought to Increase Future Profit</head><p>Our first three studies provide consistent evidence that a profit motive is thought to necessarily result in outcomes that are less beneficial for society. If profit is thought to specifically incentivize societal harm, then firms should be able to increase profits by adopting bad business practices rather than good business practices. To test this possibility, we inverted our methodological approach: in Study 4, we manipulated whether a firm planned to adopt more good business practices or bad business practices, and assessed how these changes were expected to affect the firm's long-term future profitability.</p><p>To maintain consistency with our theorizing and the measures used in Studies 1-3, our manipulations were adapted from the business practices used by CSR experts to assess firms' overall impact on society <ref type="bibr" coords="11,378.74,308.54,78.24,7.91" target="#b19">(Cheng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,461.56,308.54,80.61,7.91" target="#b81">Orlitzky et al., 2003)</ref>. Changing these practices (e.g., service quality, safety standards, employee welfare, environmental impact, deceptive marketing) should directly result in a more harmful or beneficial impact on society.</p><p>Because our previous studies indicate that perceptions of societal good and profitability vary significantly across firms and industries, Study 4 also provided a cleaner test of anti-profit beliefs by varying the same firm's plans to engage in good vs. bad practices. We predicted that plans to adopt bad practices would be expected to increase long-term profitability, while plans to adopt good practices would not necessarily be expected to affect future profits.</p><p>Finally, in this study, we asked subjects to take the perspective of the firm CEO to see what they might do if they were in charge of the firm. Because people might find self-interested profit motives more acceptable when they themselves are in charge, these instructions were intended to provide a more conservative test for the presence of anti-profit beliefs. We predicted that even when adopting the perspective of the CEO, subjects would perceive trade-offs between firm profits and good outcomes for consumers and society, consistent with anti-profit beliefs.</p></div>

On the contrary, adopting good business practices that impact society more positively was not seen as a good strategy for increasing firm profitability. Even when asked to adopt the perspective of the firm's CEO, people viewed profit as fundamentally at odds with good outcomes for consumers and society. Though the overwhelming majority of subjects expressed a desire to adopt good practices and avoid bad practices, they believed that doing so would entail sacrificing their own firms' profits. While this perspective-taking instruction arguably provided a more conservative test of the presence of anti-profit beliefs, it came after the firm motive measures and directly preceded judgments about profit, potentially limiting its effectiveness. In addition, because our single-item measure of profit motive may have limited the reliability of our results, we added an additional item in the subsequent studies.</p><p>Our findings also suggest that bad practices are thought to indicate profit motives, whereas good practices do not clearly signal a strong desire for profit, consistent with judgments in the control condition of Study 3. More importantly for our purposes, these findings suggest that the strength of firms' desire for profit is thought to determine the business practices they adopt. In other words, firms are thought to face few external constraints that prevent them from profiting through bad business practices that harm consumers and society. It is true that firms may be free to profit from bad practices when market conditions do not provide consumers with meaningful choices. However, when market conditions allow consumers to choose between competing firms and determine which firms profit, their choices constrain firms to adopt better practices if they want to profit. Our next study investigated whether people consider how competitive constraints lead firms to create value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5: Neglecting Firm Incentives Under Competition Drives Anti-Profit Beliefs</head><p>Our first four studies show that people view profit-seeking motives as fundamentally in conflict with good outcomes for society: our subjects consistently neglected the possibility that profit can incentivize firms to create value for others. Consistent with a zero-sum view of market exchange, the selfish intentions of firms were thought to correspond to market outcomes: greater profit for firms and more harmful outcomes for consumers and society.</p><p>However, competitive markets also impose situational constraints on firm behavior. Under market conditions that allow consumers to choose between competing firms, these choices determine which firms profit and thus constrain firms' behaviors. These constraints do not necessarily affect firms' internal motivations (i.e., to maximize their profits), but alter the way they must behave to pursue them.

We then prompted subjects to consider the role of consumer choice under different market conditions to examine whether this affected their judgments of profit.</p><p>In one condition, we prompted subjects to consider consumer choice in the market under Weak Competitive Constraints (i.e., when competition is low or absent). Under these conditions, consumers have few choices and cannot reward the firms that provide what they value, making it easier for firms to profit from bad practices. We expected that people would understand that these conditions limit consumer choice and increase expected profitability from bad practices.</p><p>In another condition, we prompted subjects to consider consumer choice under Strong Competitive Constraints. Under these conditions, consumers have many choices and can easily select competing products if a firm leaves them dissatisfied, making it difficult for firms to profit from bad practices.

In this condition, the consumer choice measures were presented only after their judgments of profit. Accordingly, we were able to observe whether subjects took their own perceptions of these market conditions into account in their judgments of profit when they were not prompted to do so. In other words, this allowed us to test whether their expectations of firms' ability to profit through bad practices were consistent with their own perceptions of consumer choice in this market. We predicted that subjects would perceive the market as allowing significantly greater consumer choice than a market with Weak Constraints, and to more closely resemble a market with Strong Constraints. In contrast, we predicted that they would expect bad practices to increase firm profit significantly more than a market with Strong Constraints, and more closely resemble a market with Weak Constraints. In other words, we expected an inconsistency between subjects' perceptions of choice and their judgments of profit, indicating that they neglect how consumer choice under market competition keeps firms from profiting through bad practices and incentivizes them to adopt good practices.</p></div>

This inconsistency demonstrates people's neglect of their own beliefs about consumer choice under current market conditions: they do not judge profit with these market conditions in mind unless explicitly prompted to do so.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 6: Neglecting Firms' Reputational Incentives Drives Anti-Profit Beliefs</head><p>Study 5 suggests that people neglect how consumer choice under market competition constrains firms' profit-seeking behavior, incentivizing firms to create value. Study 6 built on the same approach, again manipulating market conditions that affect consumers' ability to make meaningful choices. For consumers to incentivize firms to create the products they value, they must be able to easily distinguish good firms from bad firms by accessing and sharing information about firms' reputations. When reputational information is unavailable and exchanges mostly consist of one-time sales, consumers cannot make informed decisions about the firms that will best meet their needs and provide them the offerings they value. Under these conditions, firms can profit from deceptive or harmful practices without significantly reducing their future business. On the contrary, when reputational information is readily available across repeated exchanges, consumers can easily avoid firms that are likely to leave them dissatisfied. Hence, markets with strong reputational constraints create incentives for firms to adopt good practices to profit: investing in a good reputation by creating value can help firms maximize their own profits in the long run <ref type="bibr" coords="16,155.59,352.54,132.44,7.91" target="#b26">(Dreber, Fudenberg, &amp; Rand, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,48.00,363.54,137.07,7.91" target="#b27">Elfenbein, Fisman, &amp; McManus, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>We used the same approach as Study 5, prompting consideration of consumer choice in a market with Weak Reputational Constraints vs. Strong Reputational Constraints in separate conditions. We again included a No Prompt control condition in which subjects completed the consumer choice items after their judgments of profit, to provide insights about their baseline beliefs about market conditions. Study 6 also included an additional baseline condition. In this condition, subjects were prompted to answer the consumer choice items before judging profit, but market conditions were left Unspecified. This allowed us to directly compare how judgments of profit would be affected by simply prompting consideration of consumer choice, versus both prompting consideration of consumer choice and explicitly describing the presence of strong reputational constraints (as in the Strong Constraints condition).</p><p>We expected that in the Unspecified Constraints condition, perceptions of consumer choice would be consistent with the No Prompt condition, and resemble a market with Strong Constraints. We further expected that merely prompting consideration of consumer choice would attenuate anti-profit beliefs relative to the Weak Constraints condition, highlighting the role of neglecting how choice shapes firm incentives to engage in good practices. However, we expected that this prompt would not reduce anti-profit beliefs to the same extent as explicitly describing Strong Constraints, because a lack of understanding about how these factors incentivize firms to adopt good practices may also contribute to anti-profit beliefs.</p></div>

Hence, they judged profit as if the market had only weak constraints. Prompting them to consider consumer choice before judging profit, with or without an explicit description of market conditions, was enough to disrupt this link between firm intentions and market outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Replicating our findings from Study 5, these results show that prompting consideration of market conditions that provide consumers with meaningful choices can attenuate anti-profit beliefs. Making people think through how consumers would respond to bad firm behavior in a competitive market reduced their expectations that firms could profit by adopting bad practices.</p><p>Again, the No Prompt control condition identified an internal inconsistency in our subjects' judgments: though they believed that the extent of choice in these markets resembles a market with strong reputational constraints, they judged firms' ability to profit from bad practices as if these constraints were very weak (i.e., similar to a market with weak reputational constraints). This inconsistency demonstrates that people neglect their own perceptions of consumer choice under current market conditions: people do not judge profit with these market constraints in mind unless explicitly prompted to do so.</p><p>The additional baseline condition allowed us to assess the effects of prompting consumer choice under unspecified market conditions. Simply prompting subjects to consider consumer choice, even without specifying the presence of strong constraints, did reduce their expectations of firms' ability to profit from bad practices. Considering their own perceptions of choice within the market attenuated their anti-profit beliefs relative to the Weak Reputational Constraints condition, indicating a neglect of firm incentives for good under market constraints.</p><p>However, the Unspecified Constraints prompt did not reduce anti-profit beliefs relative to the No Prompt control condition. Thus, it was not as effective in attenuating anti-profit beliefs as explicitly describing Strong Constraints. Hence, it is possible that people do not fully understand how market conditions allow consumers' choices to incentivize good firm behavior without an explicit description. Both neglect and limitations in understanding how market constraints incentivize firms to engage in good practices may contribute to anti-profit beliefs. Study 7 further investigated this distinction by manipulating consideration of long-term incentive effects and measuring the effect on anti-profit beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 7: Considering Incentives for Production Attenuates Anti-Profit Beliefs</head><p>Studies 5 and 6 found that unless people are explicitly prompted, they neglect how profit incentivizes good practices and limits bad practices in competitive markets. We propose that this asymmetry occurs because the good outcomes incentivized by profit are less immediate, direct, and observable than the bad outcomes incentivized by profit. In other words, we expect that anti-profit beliefs involve neglecting how profit incentivizes firms to invest in future value creation. Accordingly, our final study examined whether prompting consideration of future production decisions could affect anti-profit beliefs (cf., <ref type="bibr" coords="18,412.01,435.04,134.04,7.91;18,306.00,446.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b33">Fernbach, Rogers, Fox, &amp; Sloman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,329.50,446.04,99.08,7.91" target="#b74">McCaffery &amp; Baron, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In particular, we compared how subjects would evaluate a law affecting company profit under normal circumstances or after one of two different prompts meant to affect their thinking.

Each innovation was described to be much more effective than existing products and to introduce advances that might be used in similar future products (see Appendix for full scenarios). We then mentioned a new law that removed limits on company profits in industries related to public health and environmental sustainability, respectively. While existing laws had limited the company to "moderate profits," the new law removed limits to allow for "unlimited profits from each unit" sold. This approach let us test how an external factor that allowed for higher profit was expected to affect consumers and society. The order of the vaccine and battery scenarios was counterbalanced.</p><p>Societal impact of profit. Our main dependent variable assessed beliefs about the overall societal impact of the law on a five-point scale: "All things considered, will the new law leave consumers better or worse off in the long run?" (Ϫ2 ϭ much worse off, 0 ϭ no clear effect, 2 ϭ much better off).</p><p>Immediate and long-term effects of profit. We used two sets of questions to prompt subjects to consider how the law would change firm incentives. One set of questions prompted subjects to consider the "immediate changes" the company would make in response to the new law on a four-point scale (0 ϭ definitely not, 3 ϭ definitely). Separate items assessed potential product changes that were beneficial or harmful (harmful items in brackets): "Reduce [increase] the prices it charges to consumers," "Make the product safer [less safe]," "Pay its employees more [less]," and "Increase [reduce] the quality of the product." Subjects responded consistently to the four items assessing beneficial immediate effects (␣ ϭ .79) and the four items assessing harmful immediate effects (␣ ϭ .69), and these items were averaged to create two index measures. In the Immediate Incentive Effects condition, this set of items directly preceded the main dependent variable about the overall effects of the law, as well as all of the other items.</p><p>A second set of items prompted subjects to consider the "longterm changes" the company or other companies would make over time in response to the law. Again, separate items assessed beneficial or harmful changes, using the same scale (harmful items in brackets): "This company will do more [less] research on products like this" and "This company will produce more [fewer] products like this." These items were repeated for "Other companies." Responses were consistent for the four items assessing beneficial long-term effects (␣ ϭ .90) and the four items assessing harmful long-term effects (␣ ϭ .86), and these items were averaged to create two index measures. In the Long-Term Incentive Effects condition, this set of items directly preceded the main dependent variable about the overall effects of the law, as well as all of the other items.</p><p>The No Prompt condition served as a control. Subjects in this condition answered the main dependent variable about the overall effects of the law immediately after reading the scenarios, so their responses were unaffected by the prompt items. They completed the questions about immediate and long-term effects afterward, with the order of these items counterbalanced. Hence, subjects completed all of the items in all three conditions, with question order manipulated between subjects to prompt their thinking.</p></div>

Neglect of long-term incentive effects. Finally, a series of linear regressions tested how the perceived immediate and longterm incentive effects of profit informed subjects' judgments of the overall effects of the law. Overall, subjects' judgments of the law were significantly influenced by the good immediate changes they expected the firm to make, ␤ ϭ .36, t(295) ϭ 6.29, p Ͻ .001, as well as the bad immediate changes they expected, ␤ ϭ Ϫ.27, t(295) ϭ Ϫ4.66, p Ͻ .001), but not by perceptions of the good or bad long-term changes they expected (ts Ͻ 1.3, ps Ͼ .19). Entering dummy-coded terms for each prompt indicates that prompting consideration of immediate incentive effects did not affect evaluations of the law, ␤ ϭ .01, t Ͻ 1, p ϭ .814, but prompting consideration of long-term incentives for future production led to more favorable judgments about the consequences of allowing increased profits, ␤ ϭ .20, t(293) ϭ 3.24, p ϭ .001 (see <ref type="table" coords="20,255.18,253.04,26.34,7.91" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>). No higher-order interactions were significant. Regardless of how the model was specified, beliefs about good and bad immediate effects significantly affected judgments of the law while beliefs about long-term effects did not. These results suggest that even though subjects appreciated the potential for profit to incentivize beneficial firm behaviors in the long run, they consistently neglected this possibility when judging the overall desirability of a policy allowing firms to increase profit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Subjects overlooked the long-term positive incentive effects of profit and emphasized its immediate negative incentive effects. They viewed the long-term incentives of profit as much more beneficial than harmful, on average, suggesting that they are capable of understanding the role of profit in incentivizing production decisions when explicitly prompted. Prompting consideration of the immediate effects of profit did not affect anti-profit judgments relative to control, suggesting that people already judge profit in terms of its immediate, potentially negative distributive effects. In contrast, prompting consideration of the dynamic longterm effects of profit attenuated anti-profit judgments of the law, suggesting that people do not consider on their own that profit can incentivize firms to invest in beneficial products in the future. At least in these simple abstract scenarios, people appear open to revising their anti-profit beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>People express little faith in the power of markets to create and reward value for society. Across judgments of actual Fortune 500 firms (Study 1) and entire industries (Study 2), our subjects strongly associated greater profits with business practices that produced more harmful outcomes for society. These results demonstrate the presence and prevalence of anti-profit beliefs, such that firm profit is thought to come directly at the expense of consumers and society. These judgments starkly contradict the overwhelming empirical support for a positive relationship between firm profitability and overall societal impact <ref type="bibr" coords="20,504.49,275.04,41.56,7.91;20,306.00,286.04,43.03,7.91" target="#b43">(Gordon &amp; Dahl, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="20,351.82,286.04,75.21,7.91" target="#b81">Orlitzky et al., 2003)</ref>. Moreover, the actual profits of the firms in our sample exhibited a positive association with expert measures of their overall impact on society (Study 1).</p><p>These judgments reflect perceived variation in firm motives, whereby firms are assumed to choose between seeking to benefit society and seeking to maximize their own profits (Study 1, Study 3). Organizations with good practices may be assumed to have honorable motives unless a profit motive is explicitly specified, and those same good practices may be expected to benefit society less when a profit motive is present (Study 3).</p><p>Accordingly, profit is thought to incentivize harmful societal outcomes but not beneficial societal outcomes. Greater profits are believed to result from engaging in more harmful business practices (e.g., overcharging consumers, lowering product safety standards, exploiting legal loopholes) and fewer beneficial business practices (e.g., creating what society values, producing highquality products; Study 2). Likewise, deliberately adopting bad practices (e.g., lower quality, deceptive marketing, lower employee pay, worse environmental impact) is expected to increase long-term firm profits (Studies 4 -6), while adopting better practices along these dimensions to impact society more positively is not expected to be profitable (Study 4).</p><p>Anti-profit beliefs may persist because any individual market exchange is zero-sum in isolation; more profit for the firm comes at the expense of the buyer and thus, the harmful outcomes incentivized by profit are immediately apparent. On the contrary, appreciating how profit incentivizes firms to benefit society is far more difficult, and requires consideration of the complex interplay of consumer choice and competitive firm behaviors across repeated exchanges. Hence, judgments of profit are heavily influenced by its mostly negative immediate incentive effects, but largely neglect its mostly positive long-term incentive effects (Study 7). Even when people are aware that consumers are free to choose the products they value most, and that firms' behavior is subject to competitive and reputational constraints, they neglect how these factors incentivize firms to adopt good practices in order to profit (Studies 5-6). Instead, their baseline judgments of profit resemble the judgments they make when they are explicitly told that consumers face few choices between competing firms and have little information about firms' reputations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Though the current research demonstrates some implications of anti-profit beliefs, many open questions remain that warrant further exploration. For instance, a great deal of prior work finds that people are skeptical of profit-seeking firms and suspicious of any seemingly generous behaviors by these actors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="21,250.79,319.04,37.25,7.91;21,48.00,330.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b15">Campbell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,73.23,330.04,98.42,7.91" target="#b39">Friestad &amp; Wright, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,176.37,330.04,107.79,7.91" target="#b61">Kirmani &amp; Campbell, 2004)</ref>. However, many of the studies documenting these effects use explicit cues that make profit-seeking motives salient. The current findings suggest that people perceive ample variation in organizational motives and believe that some firms seek to serve society while others selfishly seek to maximize their own profits. Hence, in the absence of existing suspicions or explicit cues about selfish motives, people may give organizations the benefit of the doubt. In other words, they may be receptive to messages or stories that highlight the genuine passions or intrinsic motives of firms, as illustrated by the success of brand narratives and relational appeals in the marketplace <ref type="bibr" coords="21,119.57,451.04,62.44,7.91" target="#b23">(Deighton, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,185.20,451.04,56.94,7.91" target="#b37">Fournier, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,245.34,451.04,42.69,7.91;21,48.00,462.04,43.32,7.91" target="#b79">Newman &amp; Cain, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,94.89,462.04,149.70,7.91" target="#b82">Paharia, Keinan, Avery, &amp; Schor, 2011)</ref>. Exploring the conditions under which people are willing to humanize profitseeking firms or view their motives as unselfish may lead to important insights (cf., <ref type="bibr" coords="21,136.60,495.04,101.85,7.91" target="#b21">Critcher &amp; Dunning, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,242.15,495.04,42.10,7.91;21,48.00,506.04,45.11,7.91" target="#b87">Rai &amp; Diermeier, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, a great deal of research in social psychology highlights how social relationships conflict with market relationships, or how marketplace actors violate interpersonal norms against self-interested motives (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="21,157.09,550.04,71.34,7.91" target="#b1">Aaker et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,232.22,550.04,55.83,7.91;21,48.00,561.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b20">Clark &amp; Mills, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,71.31,561.04,45.07,7.91" target="#b34">Fiske, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,119.19,561.04,91.67,7.91" target="#b50">Heyman &amp; Ariely, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,213.68,561.04,74.36,7.91;21,48.00,572.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b76">McGraw &amp; Tetlock, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,71.38,572.04,87.88,7.91" target="#b79">Newman &amp; Cain, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,162.15,572.04,64.51,7.91" target="#b105">Vohs et al., 2008)</ref>. However, little prior research has investigated how people perceive the underlying conditions that govern interpersonal versus marketplace interactions. Importantly, these conditions may affect the accuracy of assumptions that self-interested motives necessarily lead to harmful outcomes for others. For instance, contexts involving repeated exchanges create selfish incentives for cooperative behavior: signaling altruistic motives and investing in a good reputation can help actors maximize their own payoffs in the long run <ref type="bibr" coords="21,257.83,660.04,30.23,7.91;21,48.00,671.04,106.12,7.91" target="#b26">(Dreber, Fudenberg, &amp; Rand, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,159.66,671.04,128.37,7.91;21,48.00,682.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b27">Elfenbein, Fisman, &amp; McManus, 2015)</ref>. This alignment between self-interest and incentives for good behavior also characterizes marketplace contexts in which consumers can voluntarily choose between competing firms across repeated exchanges. The current research provides initial evidence that people seem to understand how consumer choice, competition, and reputational information directionally affects firm incentives, but may neglect to consider these factors when judging the consequences of firm profit motives for consumers and society. However, misunderstanding firm incentives for good behavior and neglecting these incentives may both contribute to anti-profit beliefs. Better distinguishing the relative importance of these mechanisms, how they apply in interpersonal versus market contexts, and how they interact may require further investigation. Despite the volume of work in this area, little research addresses when motive-centered judgments are likely to be accurate and when they are likely to err.</p><p>These possibilities suggest that the nature and extent of antiprofit beliefs may depend on how people perceive societal and marketplace norms.
