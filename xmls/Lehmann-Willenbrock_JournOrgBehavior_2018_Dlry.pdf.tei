<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Disagreements are integral to fruitful team collaboration but have rarely been studied within actual team interactions. We develop a temporal account of how disagreement episodes begin and are resolved during team interactions, testing explanatory factors at multiple levels: team context (team conflict states and team productivity), individual characteristics and perceptions (individual status and perceptions of team viability), and behavioral patterns (problem solving versus off-task communication) with a statistical discourse analysis of 32,448 turns of talk by 259 employees during 43 team meetings. As hypothesized, problem-solving behaviors (e.g., describing problems and proposing solutions) ignited content disagreements, often by participants who perceived greater team viability. In contrast, after off-task behaviors or talk by higher status team members, participants started fewer content disagreements. Moreover, content disagreements started by higher status individuals were more likely than those started by others to be resolved with agreements, especially via agreements with higher status individuals. Also, problem-solving behaviors facilitated the resolution of disagreement episodes with agreement, whereas off-task behaviors hindered them. Contrary to our hypotheses, team conflict states and productivity were not linked to starting or ending disagreements. We discuss the conceptual and methodological importance of capturing team interaction dynamics at work and derive practical implications for managing content disagreement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M. Gandhi</head><p>Disagreements encompass a range of verbal behaviors that are opposed to agreement (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,220.20,607.01,68.50,7.18;1,45.64,620.05,18.51,7.18" target="#b2">Angouri &amp; Locher, 2012)</ref>. In contrast to reflexive, uncritical agreements that can hinder team problem solving (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,142.53,633.03,75.15,7.18" target="#b0">Aldag &amp; Fuller, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,220.42,633.03,43.29,7.18" target="#b32">Esser, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,266.46,633.03,22.22,7.18;1,45.64,646.01,18.44,7.18" target="#b64">Leana, 1985)</ref>, disagreements can help teams create better solutions through integrating divergent perspectives and sparking new ideas (e.g., Jansen, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,45.64,672.03,99.98,7.18" target="#b48">Van de Vliert, &amp; West, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,147.80,672.03,78.15,7.18" target="#b93">Paulus &amp; Brown, 2007)</ref>. In this study, we focus on rejections or contradictions of other members' contributions without personal judgment (content disagreement). Content disagreement can be crucial not only for superior team problem solving and decision making but also for team and organizational effectiveness more broadly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,378.76,543.23,62.73,7.18" target="#b31">Ellis et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,445.61,543.23,104.06,7.18;1,306.65,556.21,20.38,7.18" target="#b36">Garvin, Edmondson, &amp; Gino, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,329.44,556.21,162.97,7.18" target="#b57">Kellermanns, Floyd, Pearson, &amp; Spencer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,494.76,556.21,54.88,7.18;1,306.65,569.25,18.51,7.18" target="#b110">Van Offenbeek, 2001)</ref>. As content disagreements can display and integrate different perspectives, they can help team members learn about one another's views, their interactions, and their organization (i.e., organizational learning; e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,353.88,608.20,79.57,7.18" target="#b3">Argyris &amp; Sch√∂n, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,435.46,608.20,65.17,7.18" target="#b28">Edmondson, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,502.58,608.20,39.70,7.18" target="#b98">Senge, 1990</ref>).</p><p>Yet some studies offer an alternate view. For example, Van Woerkom and Sanders (2010) report negative effects of disagreement on opinion sharing in teams. We believe that there are four reasons for such ambiguities in the literature, namely, (1) a lack of distinction between disagreements on the one hand (i.e., behaviors at specific points in team interactions) and emergent team conflict; (2) lack of distinction among different types of disagreements and their resolutions;</p><p>(3) lack of quantitative research on behaviors during actual disagreements within temporal social interactions (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.43,46.60,47.46,7.18" target="#b35">Garner, 2013)</ref>; and (4) inadequate statistical modeling of the interplay among individual attitudes, team attributes, and behavioral dynamics that trigger disagreement occurrences. To resolve these ambiguities, we examine disagreement episodes and resolutions as they unfold in real time during regular team meeting interactions-rather than relying on aggregations of such behaviors or post hoc self-reports. We draw from psychological perspectives of disagreement and team interactions, and we use quantitative methodology and statistical modeling to test our hypotheses.</p><p>Importantly, disagreements within teams are not isolated occurrences. Instead, each disagreement begins and ends within social and temporal contexts, so we must account for explanatory mechanisms at multiple levels (team, individual, and behavioral or turn of talk level; e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,62.53,228.58,128.33,7.18" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2016)</ref>. The behaviors that shape disagreement episodes at the behavioral level are nested in the individuals who produce them, who in turn are nested in teams. Consequently, disagreement episodes are affected by influences stemming from the team context, from individual characteristics and attitudes, and from temporal dynamics at the behavioral event level. Hence, we integrate theory about team contextual factors, emergent team states, and individual-level influences on dynamic team interaction processes in ongoing teams to develop a multilevel temporal account of disagreement episodes in ongoing team interactions.</p><p>In terms of team contextual influences, we consider the role of general team productivity levels and previously emerged team conflict states (i.e., members' shared perceptions about task and relationship conflict experienced to date; e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.48,397.58,118.20,7.18;2,45.64,410.56,61.96,7.18">Maltarich, Kukenberger, Reilly, &amp; Mathieu, in press)</ref>. Teams with superior productivity might capitalize on disagreements to improve their performance or have greater confidence to express their ideas (including conflicting ones), both of which tend to yield more disagreements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,182.16,449.57,106.53,7.18;2,45.64,462.55,20.38,7.18" target="#b71">Lovelace, Shapiro, &amp; Weingart, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,70.07,462.55,117.84,7.18" target="#b112">Van Woerkom &amp; Sanders, 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, a team that experiences greater intragroup conflict might (a) view disagreement as socially acceptable and hence express more disagreements compared to other teams <ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.71,501.55,150.91,7.18;2,45.64,514.53,43.74,7.18" target="#b115">(Weingart, Behfar, Bendersky, Todorova, &amp; Jehn, 2016)</ref> or (b) suffer more social embarrassments, fear the consequences of fueling disagreements, and refrain from voicing disagreements (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.54,540.55,74.30,7.18" target="#b115">Weingart et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Next, we consider the influence of individual perceptions of team viability and individual status. Individuals who care more about the long-term future of their team (i.e., who experience high team viability, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,62.93,592.54,91.19,7.18" target="#b7">Bell &amp; Marentette, 2011)</ref> might be more likely than others to invite ideas from others, identify flaws, and share alternatives-the latter two often foster disagreements. Furthermore, people are often more likely to agree with a high-status team member than a low-status one and less likely to disagree with the former than the latter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,262.43,644.58,26.19,7.18;2,45.64,657.57,41.25,7.18" target="#b19">(Chiu &amp; Khoo, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, temporal dynamics at the event level can influence team behaviors in general (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.19,683.53,129.46,7.18" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords=""></ref> Lehmann-Willenbrock, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,128.69,696.57,106.16,7.18" target="#b68">Chiu, Lei, &amp; Kauffeld, 2017)</ref> and ignite or resolve disagreements. Specific behaviors can create distinct momentary conversational contexts that could influence the likelihoods of starting or ending disagreements. Problem-solving behaviors and sequences (e.g., identifying problems and proposing solutions) might invite alternate views, thereby starting disagreements but also helping to resolve them. In contrast, off-task behaviors and sequences (e.g., laughing or engaging in side conversations) might distract from the central task to reduce tension, thereby reducing the likelihoods of both starting a disagreement and ending an ongoing one.</p><p>To address these issues, we apply a multilevel, time-series method, statistical discourse analysis (SDA; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,432.79,124.54,47.02,7.18" target="#b18">Chiu, 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,484.27,124.54,65.39,7.18;2,306.65,137.58,73.03,7.18" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2016)</ref>, to videotaped meeting conversations (N = 32,448 turns of talk) in a sample of 43 real teams. Although inspired by discourse analysis, SDA itself is a statistical method built on ordinary least squares regression (see details in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.62,176.58,61.98,7.18;2,306.65,189.57,64.89,7.18" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2016)</ref>. Our study contributes to the literature on workplace dynamics, teams' temporal processes, and temporal dynamics surrounding disagreements in three key ways. First, we introduce and test a multilevel (team, individual, and turn of talk), time-series, explanatory model for igniting verbally expressed disagreements, thereby addressing repeated calls to study the temporal nature of team interactions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,344.46,267.57,130.48,7.18" target="#b23">Cronin, Weingart, &amp; Todorova, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,477.47,267.57,72.16,7.18;2,306.65,280.56,55.99,7.18" target="#b114">Waller, Okhuysen, &amp; Saghafian, 2016)</ref>. Second, we introduce and test a corresponding multilevel, time-series, explanatory model for resolving a disagreement with an agreement. Third, we disentangle disagreement behaviors embedded in temporal team interaction sequences from emergent conflict states, thus resolving ambiguities in the team conflict literature. As this study can inform our understanding of how teams ignite and resolve disagreements at the behavioral level, it can yield important insights for managing team dynamics-a critical leadership challenge (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.60,384.53,120.33,7.18" target="#b85">Morgeson, DeRue, &amp; Karam, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES</head><p>Team interactions are complex, temporal, multilevel phenomena.</p><p>Early work by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,361.64,475.60,57.33,7.18" target="#b79">McGrath (1984)</ref> described them as "patterned relations" (p. 11). They are complex because they (a) entail members' interdependent acts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,362.61,501.56,145.51,7.18">(Marks, Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001, p. 357)</ref>, (b) require constant coordination among member contributions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,508.42,514.60,41.24,7.18;2,306.65,527.58,18.44,7.18" target="#b61">Kolbe et al., 2014)</ref>, and (c) are at the core of teamwork itself (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.65,540.56,123.91,7.18" target="#b39">Grossman, Friedman, &amp; Kalra, 2017)</ref>. Team interactions are inherently temporal because team task accomplishment requires temporal rhythms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.26,566.59,134.34,7.18" target="#b83">Mohammed, Hamilton, &amp; Lim, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,497.76,566.59,51.90,7.18;2,306.65,579.57,82.84,7.18" target="#b118">Zellmer-Bruhn, Waller, &amp; Ancona, 2004)</ref>, and team dynamics are temporally patterned (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.72,592.61,145.62,7.18" target="#b76">Massey, Montoya-Weiss, &amp; Hung, 2003</ref>; see also Lehmann-Willenbrock &amp; Allen, 2017). Finally, team interactions are multilevel phenomena because their constituent behaviors are nested in temporal behavioral contexts, in individuals, and in teams. Hence, discrete interaction events such as disagreement are subject to influences at the behavioral event level, at the individual level, and at the team level.</p><p>Regarding multilevel influences on team interactions, research insights to date are limited. Current multilevel thinking in team research typically argues how emergent team states manifest upward from individual-level characteristics and interactions among individuals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,324.91,722.60,171.59,7.18" target="#b62">Kozlowski, Chao, Grand, Braun, &amp; Kuljanin, 2013)</ref>. This perspective is certainly helpful for understanding how emergent team constructs come into existence in the first place, yet it does not explain how these constructs, once emerged, affect ongoing teams' future behaviors and interactions. Hence, we develop a multilevel and temporal perspective of team interactions themselves, adopting a microlevel, temporal, behavioral approach to team interactions and accounting for explanatory variables at multiple levels (behavioral, individual, and team).</p><p>Figure 1 illustrates our overall theoretical approach. As depicted in <ref type="figure" coords="3,45.64,137.59,27.93,7.18">Figure 1</ref>, we consider disagreement episodes in team interactions as specific behavioral events nested in temporal behavioral contexts, individuals, and teams. In other words, the events that comprise a disagreement episode are subject to team context influences, individual influences, and behavioral dynamics at the event level. At the team and individual levels, we further distinguish between relatively stable characteristics and dynamic states, both of which may affect team interactions in general and disagreement episodes within such interactions in particular. Next, we consider the multilevel influences on disagreement episodes in temporal team interactions from a topdown perspective, beginning with team-level influences, moving to individual-level influences, and finally zooming in on microlevel behavioral dynamics.</p><p>In terms of team-level influences, relatively stable team context variables that affect the ways in which a disagreement episode unfolds include team composition characteristics, such as the gender ratio (sometimes termed cumulative team constructs, as they are based in individual characteristics that cumulate at the team level <ref type="bibr" coords="3,257.60,358.58,3.02,7.18">;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,265.27,358.58,23.40,7.18;3,45.64,371.56,41.93,7.18" target="#b23">Cronin et al., 2011)</ref>. Relatively stable context characteristics also include a team's overall performance level across longer time spans, which can serve as an input for future interactions <ref type="bibr" coords="3,190.83,397.58,97.85,7.18;3,45.64,410.56,51.00,7.18" target="#b46">(Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, &amp; Jundt, 2005)</ref>. Dynamic influences at the team level concern emergent team states, such as team conflict states (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,240.66,423.55,47.98,7.18;3,45.64,436.58,20.38,7.18" target="#b23">Cronin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,68.09,436.58,76.23,7.18" target="#b62">Kozlowski et al., 2013)</ref>. The distinction between emergent team states and behavioral interaction dynamics is important, both conceptually and methodologically (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,203.70,462.55,84.96,7.18" target="#b34">Fulmer &amp; Ostroff, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,45.64,475.59,76.28,7.18" target="#b62">Kozlowski et al., 2013)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" coords="3,138.56,475.59,90.81,7.18">Marks et al. (2001, p. 357)</ref> noted, emergent team states such as team conflict states are "cognitive, motivational, and affective states of teams, as opposed to the nature of their member interaction." Furthermore, as emergent states are the product of prior team experiences and interactions, they become inputs for subsequent interaction processes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,158.63,540.56,74.19,7.18" target="#b75">(Marks et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,237.43,540.56,51.23,7.18;3,45.64,553.54,39.26,7.18">see also Ilgen et al., 2005)</ref>. Hence, in ongoing teams, emergent team states continue to affect future interactions. As such, we consider their influence on specific disagreement episodes at the behavioral level.</p><p>In terms of influential factors at the individual level, we again distinguish between stable individual properties, such as an individual's tenure-based status in the team, and more fluid individual attitudes about the team. Both stable individual characteristics and individual attitudes may affect how a disagreement episode unfolds: by influencing actions of the current speaker at a given moment of the interaction or by influencing actions of the following speaker or both. In other words, they may affect the likelihood that an individual disagrees, and they may also affect the likelihood that others disagree with this individual. Similarly, these individual-level characteristics and attitudes may affect the likelihood of resolving a disagreement. We particularly consider how the relatively stable role of individual status affects behaviors and interactions, specifically igniting and resolving disagreements, given the impact of individual status for communication behavior more broadly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,384.72,254.54,87.73,7.18" target="#b10">Bienefeld &amp; Grote, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,474.69,254.54,74.93,7.18;3,306.65,267.58,60.81,7.18" target="#b116">Weisband, Schneider, &amp; Connolly, 1995)</ref>. We also consider fluid individual attributes, such as experiences of team viability, which is an important indicator of perceived team effectiveness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,423.72,293.54,99.41,7.18" target="#b5">Balkundi &amp; Harrison, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,527.07,293.54,22.56,7.18;3,306.65,306.58,63.70,7.18" target="#b7">Bell &amp; Marentette, 2011)</ref> and as such might affect both individual interaction behavior in general and disagreement behavior in particular.</p><p>Yet team interaction in general, and the initiation and resolution of disagreement in particular, depends not only on characteristics of each individual speaker or the surrounding team context but also on the conversational dynamics preceding each behavior. A person's behaviors during team interactions typically respond to other team members' behaviors and in turn invite specific future behaviors from them, thereby forming temporal sequences of behavior. As the behaviors within a temporal sequence of team interactions are often related to one another (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,440.39,436.57,109.23,7.18;3,306.65,449.56,18.44,7.18" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2016)</ref>, we must account for the ways in which recent behaviors (microtime context) affect the likelihood of a target behavior (in our case, starting a disagreement or resolving it) at each moment in time.</p><p>Hence, beyond team-and individual-level influences, we also explore how the microtime context at the behavioral level influences the ignition or resolution of disagreements. Specifically, we test how attributes of team members' recent turns of talk might be related to the likelihoods of igniting or resolving disagreements at each conversational turn <ref type="bibr" coords="3,345.26,553.53,47.02,7.18" target="#b18">(Chiu, 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,394.64,553.53,121.96,7.18" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2016</ref> After differentiating content disagreement from related constructs and clarifying the behavioral qualities of this phenomenon in the context of temporal team interactions, we explore multilevel influences at the team, individual, and behavioral levels on igniting and resolving disagreements in temporal team interactions.</p></div>

Simple rejections, counterarguments, or contradictions of a prior opinion, solution, or suggestion all qualify as content disagreements.</p><p>To delineate content disagreement clearly, we disentangle it from personal insult by distinguishing between content disagreement on the one hand (i.e., disagreeing with prior content or disagreeing based on facts) and personal criticisms on the other hand (i.e., criticizing characteristics of a previous speaker rather than focusing on the discussion content; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,76.37,371.56,137.23,7.18" target="#b55">Kauffeld &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2012)</ref>.

Yet we acknowledge that task conflict and content disagreement can overlap. Though conflict scholars have typically focused on team members' perceptions of disagreements about how to accomplish particular aspects of their tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,86.11,579.56,57.01,7.18" target="#b24">De Dreu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,146.72,579.56,41.98,7.18" target="#b49">Jehn, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,192.30,579.56,92.65,7.18" target="#b99">Simons &amp; Peterson, 2000)</ref>, recent work highlights the role of actual expressions of conflict <ref type="bibr" coords="4,45.64,605.58,126.12,7.18" target="#b106">(Todorova, Bear, &amp; Weingart, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,174.50,605.58,75.43,7.18" target="#b115">Weingart et al., 2016)</ref>. When an instance of content disagreement indicates a difference of opinion regarding the team's task content and related decisions, this disagreement can be viewed as a discrete expression of task conflict. Yet there are also other cases when content disagreements differ from task conflict, specifically recognized errors. For example, during a team meeting, a member may disagree with a previous statement about organizational knowledge ("No, that guy retired a while ago"), with details of a solution ("No, actually what I meant was"), or with the documentation of the meeting results so far ("Hang on, that's wronglooks like a typo"). All of these are examples of content disagreement, but they would not be considered expressions of task conflict. Content disagreements can yield at least four benefits for teams: increased attention, expression of more ideas, improved problem solving, and greater learning. As a disagreement legitimizes different opinions, it stimulates group members to pay attention and share more of their own ideas, including those unrelated to the specific disagreement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,324.96,111.56,84.45,7.18" target="#b25">De Dreu &amp; West, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,411.98,111.56,85.75,7.18" target="#b87">Nemeth &amp; Rogers, 1996)</ref>.

In contrast, disagreement episodes refer to behavioral dynamics within ongoing team interactions. Naturally, emergent team conflict states and disagreement episodes in team interactions can be related. For instance, a history of repeated disagreements can result in (accumulated) perceptions of intragroup conflict. Moreover, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="5,156.87,150.57,27.48,7.18">Figure 1</ref>, emergent conflict states can also ignite-or inhibit-subsequent disagreements in ongoing team interactions.

As such, our coding and analysis approach contained both qualitative and quantitative elements; the content analysis determined which of the mutually exclusive behavioral codes fit each individual communicative act, and the quantitative analyses tested the relations among these codes.</p><p>Five coders were intensively trained with the act4teams coding scheme. According to the act4teams coding rules, behavioral units were defined as communicative statements, which, in context, could be understood by another member as equivalent to a single simple sentence (i.e., "sense units"; <ref type="bibr" coords="7,408.02,332.55,41.76,7.18" target="#b4">Bales, 1950)</ref>.

Whereas unitizing traditionally requires reliability analysis (Guetzkow's U), software-supported coding and live video entails units marked according to time rather than words. As two coders cannot unitize a video at the exact same nanosecond, behavioral units were identified by only one coder, whereas the behavioral annotations were performed by two separate coders for reliability analysis (for a similar procedure, see Lehmann-Willenbrock, Allen, &amp; Kauffeld, 2013). The interrater reliability of the behavioral coding among our five raters was high, Fleiss' ƒ∏ = .81). Any disagreements between the raters were resolved by discussion to reach consensus.</p><p>Content disagreement was operationalized as any statement expressing opposition to prior contributions on the content level, such as disagreeing with an opinion or suggestion, contradicting a previous contribution, or dissenting from previous content. Examples include "I don't see it like that‚Ä¶," "That is not what it's about," and "That is not true." We also coded for four other types of disagreement: problems with a solution (e.g., "If we actually did this, it would damage‚Ä¶"), criticizing statements (e.g., "No, that's a stupid idea"), blaming (e.g., "you messed up here"), and statements signaling no interest in change (e.g., "Forget it, nothing ever works out here").</p></div>

The items were "I would like to keep working in this team for a long time" and "I would like to continue to work together with the other members of my team" (Cronbach's Œ± = .80).</p><p>Finally, each month, both companies regularly assessed each team's productivity by measuring the ratio of achieved performance against its target performance (e.g., planned number of parts manufactured per month). Exceeding the target yields a team productivity rating exceeding 100%, whereas performance below the target yields a rating below 100%. To account for differences in performance standards and assessment in the two companies, we z-standardized all monthly performance ratings prior to further analyses. Team productivity was then operationalized as each team's annual average across these monthly z scores (yielding an average of 0.95 across all teams; ranging from ‚àí11.41 to 10.05).</p></div>

Although many researchers described disagreement as a defining component of conflict <ref type="bibr" coords="14,497.03,46.60,52.69,7.18;14,306.65,59.58,38.68,7.18">(e.g., Weingart et al., 2016)</ref>, our findings indicate that distinguishing discrete disagreement occurrences from emergent perceptions of intragroup conflict can improve both theoretical clarity and empirical analysis. Still, our finding that existing team conflict was unrelated to the likelihood of disagreement (and its resolution) is somewhat at odds with the notion that existing emergent states can affect future interaction episodes through feedback loops (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,412.33,137.59,73.17,7.18" target="#b77">Mathieu et al., 2008)</ref>. However, emergent states such as intragroup conflict may fluctuate over time, and it was measured only once, so we suggest interpreting this finding cautiously (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,350.08,176.59,77.13,7.18" target="#b62">Kozlowski et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Third, unlike team productivity, perceived team viability was an important precursor to content disagreements, which underscores the need to consider multiple criteria for team effectiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="14,513.35,215.54,36.27,7.18;14,306.65,228.58,20.38,7.18" target="#b42">(Hackman, 1987)</ref> and addresses calls for research on team viability as one such criterion <ref type="bibr" coords="14,338.06,241.56,87.45,7.18" target="#b7">(Bell &amp; Marentette, 2011)</ref>. This result suggests that the additional future orientation of team viability (over team productivity) might serve as added incentive for team members to share ideas, flaws, and alternatives, as the benefits of improving long-term mutual understanding and performance might outweigh potentially face-threatening disagreements <ref type="bibr" coords="14,361.70,306.59,47.15,7.18" target="#b17">(Chiu, 2008a)</ref>. Moreover, our finding that existing perceptions of team viability as a context factor were linked to content disagreements aligns with input-mediator-output-input models of team processes and effectiveness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,444.24,345.59,58.60,7.18" target="#b46">Ilgen et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, the results suggest that even in groups without explicit leaders, status (team members' professional education, age, and organizational tenure) has strong influences on starting and ending disagreements. Team members were less likely to begin a disagreement after a team member with more professional education spoke, possibly because the latter was more likely to be correct <ref type="bibr" coords="14,472.48,423.54,43.57,7.18" target="#b17">(Chiu, 2008a)</ref>, because their higher status inhibited others from disagreeing, or both <ref type="bibr" coords="14,523.05,436.58,26.58,7.18;14,306.65,449.56,40.30,7.18" target="#b19">(Chiu &amp; Khoo, 2003)</ref>. Future studies can clarify the extent to which one or both possible explanations apply across various contexts. In this study, the correlation matrix shows that professional education was not significantly linked to turns that included identifying problems or proposing solutions, indicating no greater likelihood of problem finding or problem solving. If a person is inhibited from disagreeing with team members with more professional education, flaws and errors might not be reported <ref type="bibr" coords="14,306.65,540.55,38.98,7.18" target="#b14">(Chiu, 2000)</ref>, harming the team's overall understanding and stifling collective learning in teams and organizations (for detailed arguments regarding the complications of status as an obstacle to organizational learning more broadly, see <ref type="bibr" coords="14,349.34,579.56,96.88,7.18" target="#b12">Bunderson &amp; Reagans, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, disagreements started by people with higher status (specifically, professional education or age) were more likely to be resolved by agreement, which suggests the greater value of their disagreements compared to others' disagreements, their superior incentive, or their stronger social skills for resolving them. People with higher status might have greater knowledge or experience that helps them identify issues of greater importance <ref type="bibr" coords="14,375.02,670.55,72.15,7.18" target="#b19">(Chiu &amp; Khoo, 2003)</ref> when they ignite a disagreement; in this study, however, participants who were older or had more professional education were not more likely than others to find problems or propose solutions (bivariate correlations), which does not support the claim that their disagreements were more valuable. Regarding social skills, those with above median professional education were more likely than others to listen actively (+18%) and less likely to complain (‚àí82%), but older workers (above median) were slightly more likely than younger workers to complain (+1%) and slightly less likely to listen actively (‚àí1%).</p><p>These correlations suggest that those with more professional education might have better social skills that facilitate resolution of disagreements via agreements. Although the current data show no support to warrant deference to older participants, future studies can examine the impact of differential valuations of disagreements by status and their relation to facilitating consensus.</p><p>Team members were also more likely to resolve a disagreement by agreeing with others who held greater organizational tenure, and the latter were slightly more likely to proffer a solution. These findings suggest that team members with greater organizational tenure might create higher quality solutions or receive more favorable evaluations of their solutions or both. Future studies can determine the extent to which one or both possible explanations apply across various contexts.</p><p>Overall, future research can determine the degree to which status effects are harmful or simply reflect stronger problem finding, problem solving, or social resolution skills.</p><p>Fifth, the positive effect of problem-solving behaviors on igniting and resolving disagreements point to the importance of disagreements when completing these tasks and suggest the need for a supportive team culture. When team members engage in problem-solving behaviors, they share information and perspectives that might not only contribute to problem finding and problem solving but also serve as grist for disagreements. In safe, supportive team cultures that value people and ideas, individuals can share their views and disagree without concern about losing face or harming their interpersonal relationships. Thus, these results suggest the importance of cultivating a climate of psychological safety (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,169.74,410.56,80.26,7.18" target="#b29">Edmondson &amp; Lei, 2014</ref>) that facilitates sharing of ideas and nonthreatening disagreements.</p><p>In contrast, off-task behaviors, such as laughing and side talk, offer distractions and hence no task content with which to disagree.</p><p>Although they reduce the likelihood of disagreement, they apparently do not contribute toward completion of the task. Interestingly, although none of the off-task behaviors ignited disagreement, complaining facilitated rather than inhibited resolution of disagreements (see <ref type="table" coords="15,90.93,514.54,27.32,7.18" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>). Although we can only speculate about a complaining mechanism, previous research seems to suggest that complaining statements can shift the conversational focus away from the problem solving and toward a shared experience of feeling helpless or even victimized, which triggers agreement by others and can trap teams within a complaining loop <ref type="bibr" coords="15,160.72,579.56,86.87,7.18" target="#b56">(Kauffeld &amp; Meyers, 2009</ref>).</p><p>In addition to igniting content disagreements, problem-solving behaviors can also resolve them. Describing problems, proposing solutions, describing solutions, arguing for solution, and sharing organizational knowledge were all linked to resolving disagreements via agreements. Hence, many of the same behaviors that help ignite content disagreements also help resolve them. In contrast, off-task behaviors, such as laughing and side talk, reduce the likelihood of resolving a disagreement with an agreement. These results are consistent with the view that team members who share ideas increasingly have similar information sets, understand one another better, and share sufficiently overlapping understanding to reach agreement <ref type="bibr" coords="15,215.94,722.54,72.67,7.18;15,45.64,735.58,18.51,7.18" target="#b26">(Dennen &amp; Wieland, 2007)</ref>. These results also reinforce the importance of a supportive team culture to continue sharing ideas after a disagreement to resolve it, rather than avoiding sharing of additional ideas for fear of inflaming the disagreement, which instead hinders its resolution by agreement. Our results suggest that a comprehensive theory of team disagreements must include attributes of teams, individuals, and turns of talk.</p><p>As such, our temporal approach to disagreement episodes also aligns with prior work on the social embeddedness of workplace behavior more broadly <ref type="bibr" coords="15,334.03,345.58,121.93,7.18" target="#b27">(Dutton, Workman, &amp; Hardin, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,457.91,345.58,91.82,7.18;15,306.65,358.57,93.36,7.18" target="#b101">Spreitzer, Sutcliffe, Dutton, Sonenshein, &amp; Grant, 2005)</ref>. As explanatory variables at multiple levels were significant, ignoring all variables within any level sharply increases the danger of omitted variable bias, in part because correlations between variables at the same level are typically higher than those between variables across levels <ref type="bibr" coords="15,370.71,410.55,145.80,7.18" target="#b22">(Chiu, Molenaar, Chen, Wise, &amp; Fujita, 2013</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="15,471.57,514.53,37.35,7.18" target="#b97">(Roe, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, the finding that explanatory variables at the behavioral event level accounted for much more of the variances in disagreements and their resolutions compared to static individual or group attributes is consistent with past studies of temporal interaction processes in groups and teams <ref type="bibr" coords="15,430.47,579.57,45.14,7.18" target="#b17">(Chiu, 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,484.84,579.57,20.67,7.18" target="#b18">(Chiu, , 2008b</ref> </p></div>

As team members were more likely to agree with (and less likely to disagree with) a highstatus person (e.g., senior team member), they might defer to the latter's judgment too quickly; thus, they might be less likely to (a) publicly identify flaws in the latter's proposals, (b) share superior alternatives, or (c) spend enough time to ensure that all team members understand the proposal. Furthermore, a high-status team member's content disagreements were more likely than those of low-status team members to be resolved with an agreement, possibly indicating that the former were more valued than the latter, but further research is needed on this issue. Although greater differences in status coincided with stronger effects, creating teams whose members have identical status or even moderately equal status across multiple dimensions (e.g., education, age, and tenure) is difficult and likely impractical as teams typically consist of members with complementary skills and experiences needed to complete a joint task. Instead, teams can aim for an open and welcoming culture in which all members are invited to share their ideas without fear of embarrassment or harm to their social relationships. For example, a team leader could ask all members to list their ideas without their names in a first round (nominal group technique, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,198.43,566.01,59.23,7.18" target="#b105">Thompson, 2003)</ref> and then to ask for advantages and disadvantages of each idea in a second round to help focus criticisms on the ideas rather than the people.</p><p>Third, our findings point to team viability as an important context factor for promoting content disagreement, which can also be leveraged to improve teamwork. Importantly, team viability is an experience that team members develop over time and that may fluctuate depending on the team processes and outcomes. Hence, team training activities aimed at fostering members' sense of the sustainability and growth of their team <ref type="bibr" coords="16,92.18,683.53,88.13,7.18" target="#b7">(Bell &amp; Marentette, 2011)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">| Limitations and future research directions</head><p>Our study has several limitations that can provide avenues for future research. First, the particular study context and sample (i.e., leaderless team interactions in industrial worksites, with predominantly male members in two firms in Germany) limit the generalizability of our findings to teams in other fields, with other gender compositions, with a leader present, or across different cultural settings. The context investigated here is prototypical for team interactions in industrial settings where leaderless problem-solving meetings are regularly implemented as part of the continuous improvement process in factory organization design (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,349.68,186.00,37.28,7.18" target="#b47">Imai, 2012)</ref>. Nevertheless, future research should investigate whether our conclusions regarding the initiation and resolution of disagreement episodes will be replicated in different team settings.</p><p>Future research should also pay particular attention to gendered differences in the context of disagreement in team interactions, which may pertain to both the expression of and the responses to disagreement. Moreover, future research can illuminate the role of the surrounding organizational culture for disagreement episodes in teams.</p><p>Whereas we did not find an effect of the surrounding organization on the observed disagreement episodes and their resolution in our data, organizational culture may constitute a macrolevel influence on behavioral norms and conversational patterns in other samples.</p><p>Second, our finding that state conflict was unrelated to disagreement episodes might differ for teams that have shorter histories than the teams in our sample. In particular, when examining zero-history teams, state conflict has yet to emerge (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="16,465.79,381.02,80.18,7.18" target="#b62">Kozlowski et al., 2013)</ref>, Finally, we focused on content disagreement here because of its benefits for team and organizational learning as discussed earlier (e.</p><p>g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,317.03,628.03,58.42,7.18" target="#b31">Ellis et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,378.20,628.03,65.89,7.18" target="#b36">Garvin et al., 2008)</ref>, but other types of disagreements might emerge through different temporal patterns and multilevel influences. Hence, future research could utilize SDA to investigate when and why other types of disagreements (e.g., criticizing or rudely disagreeing; <ref type="bibr" coords="16,399.68,680.02,41.25,7.18" target="#b16">Chiu, 2005)</ref> are ignited or resolved during dynamic team interactions at work.   </p></div>

Each set of explanatory variables below was tested for significance 

with a nested hypothesis test (chi-square log likelihood, Kennedy, 2008). 

Next, we entered group variables: group means (team-level aggre-

gates of perceived task conflict, perceived relationship conflict, and per-

ceived team viability; team average age, team tenure, and organizational 

tenure), number of women in group, productivity, group size, women 

ratio, and total group number of turns (Group). When the dependent 

variable was start of a content disagreement, this specification tested 1, 

2a, 2b, and 6. When the dependent variable was ending a disagreement 

with an agreement, this specification tested 1, 2a, and 2b. Then, we 

entered time variables, start time of turn, and duration of turn (Time).

Rather than relying solely on survey proxies about members' views of how disagreements began and ended, we captured both their team interactions and survey responses to show how perceptions and actual behaviors are related to one another (see also<ref type="bibr" coords="15,476.96,163.55,72.67,7.18;15,306.65,176.58,47.65,7.18" target="#b6">Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Funder, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, our analysis enabled testing of hypotheses regarding how behaviors within a sequence are related to one another across time. Specifically, we showed how attributes of earlier turns of talk (e.g., describing a problem [‚àí2] and solution [‚àí1]) were related to the next turn of talk (e.g., starting a content disagreement). As such, our findings align with previous work on the temporal dynamics of team conversations and illustrate how the social and temporal microcontext influences disagreements in teams (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" coords="15,443.56,267.58,44.36,7.18" target="#b18">Chiu, 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,489.65,267.58,60.00,7.18;15,306.65,280.56,66.31,7.18" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Lehmann- Willenbrock, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,375.30,280.56,103.33,7.18" target="#b111">Van Oortmerssen et al., 2015)</ref>.</figDesc><table></table></figure>

Hence, modeling the temporal embeddedness of the observed behaviors reduces the likelihood of biased conclusions (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" coords="15,479.90,436.58,69.71,7.18" target="#b20">Chiu &amp; Khoo, 2005;</ref>    Chiu &amp; Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2016). Beyond team processes, these considerations also apply to organizational behavior more generally.Studying disagreements and their resolutions during team interactions, and modeling the influence of individual and team characteristics at the behavioral event level where these phenomena happen, addresses the call to study "what happens rather than what is"</figDesc><table></table></figure>

Our multilevel analysis showed that most of the variance occurred at the turn level (over 96%), not at the individual or group level-probably not surprising as a single person can express extremely different thoughts across turns of talk. This variance result highlights the importance of modeling behaviors as the basic unit of analysis. In contrast, behavioral data aggregated to the individual (or team) levels (e.g., by counting the overall frequency of each individuals' disagreements and resolutions) waste most of the data; hence, analyses of aggregations of similar data that purport to explain most of the variance actually account for little of it (e.g., a model accounting for 80% of the individual variance accounts for only 3% of the total variance in these data [3.2% = 80% * (100% ‚àí 96%)]).</figDesc><table></table></figure>

Specifically, team development initiatives can promote the value of content disagreements, explain the benefits of problem-solving communication, and cultivate supportive team cultures. To educate teams about the necessity of content disagreement, team developers can highlight how it helps teams improve their problem solving, enhance the quality of their ideas, help them understand one another better, and enjoy more effective collaborations. Furthermore, team development can also emphasize how problem-solving behaviors both ignite and resolve content disagreements, in contrast to off-task diversions.

Moreover, future research can investigate additional team context variables, such as psychological safety climate, that may facilitate voicing disagreement and help overcome inhibitions to disagree with higher status individuals (Bunderson &amp; Reagans, 2011; Edmondson &amp; Lei, 2014). Third, other individual characteristics aside from status and perceptions of team viability might be linked to igniting or resolving disagreements during team interactions. Future studies can test how individual dispositions (e.g., positive or negative affectivity; Kaplan, Bradley, Luchman, &amp; Haynes, 2009) might affect the ignition or resolution of disagreements. Moreover, future research can explore how the power orientation of higher status individuals (for an overview, see Bunderson &amp; Reagans, 2011) might moderate the effects of status during disagreement episodes.</figDesc><table></table></figure>
