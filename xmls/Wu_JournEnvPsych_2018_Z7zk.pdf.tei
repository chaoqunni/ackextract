<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the ubiquity of waste disposal in urban environments, there is little standardization of receptacle or signage design within and across jurisdictions. In three experiments, we explored the impact of waste disposal signage design on disposal behavior. Specifically, we were interested in two primary questions in signage design: 1) what type of waste disposal information should be presented; and 2) how the information should be presented. We found that signs containing either icons or pictures of permitted items improved sorting performance compared to signs containing only words of the items; consistent positioning of the signs improved sorting performance compared to random positions for both pictures and icons; and presenting both permitted and prohibited items can interfere with performance when the signs are icons. The current study provides experimental evidence to demonstrate that the design of waste disposal signage can impact waste sorting performance in meaningful ways and highlights the need for graphical signage and bin standardization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Waste disposal receptacles and bins are ubiquitous in the urban environment. They are commonly placed in people's homes, offices, and on the streets. The popularity of recycling programs in recent years has led to an increase in waste disposal bin categories (e.g., paper, bottles, compost). This development inevitably requires people to learn to sort their waste in the respective bins, which necessitates new designs of waste disposal signage to help guide users to correctly sort their waste.</p><p>Unlike other types of public signs (e.g., traffic signs), there is little standardization among waste disposal signage. Waste disposal signage, the physical appearance of the bins, and the positioning of the bins, differ substantially between neighbouring jurisdictions. Even within the same jurisdiction or institution, there are often diverse signage and bins used in different buildings <ref type="bibr" coords="1,152.11,584.09,136.53,7.17;1,37.59,594.58,58.38,7.17" target="#b1">(Andrews, Gregoire, Rasmussen, &amp; Witowich, 2013)</ref>. This is problematic given that standardization is an important ergonomic principle known to increase user comprehension and compliance <ref type="bibr" coords="1,96.21,615.50,99.45,7.17" target="#b7">(Ben-Bassat &amp; Shinar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,198.31,615.50,90.29,7.17;1,37.59,625.93,67.69,7.17" target="#b35">Shinar, Dewar, Summala, &amp; Zakowska, 2003)</ref>. The lack of standardization can be confusing and frustrating for users, which leads to improper sorting. Improperly sorted waste increases the costs of recycling programs by increasing the time and labour required to properly re-sort items at a centralized sorting facility or at the pick-up truck <ref type="bibr" coords="1,422.81,437.66,134.78,7.17;1,306.60,448.14,19.32,7.17" target="#b9">(Bohm, Folz, Kinnaman, &amp; Podolsky, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The research literature suggests that other ergonomic principles should be considered in addition to signage standardization (for example, constructing and placing signs so that they are conceptually and spatially compatible with the message they represent <ref type="bibr" coords="1,506.72,489.98,50.94,7.17;1,306.60,500.41,18.70,7.17" target="#b35">(Shinar et al., 2003)</ref>). While there is a wealth of research addressing the components of effective signage in areas like traffic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,480.82,510.90,76.79,7.17;1,306.60,521.33,19.32,7.17" target="#b7">Ben-Bassat &amp; Shinar, 2006)</ref>, industrial safety (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,418.79,521.33,50.45,7.17" target="#b14">Collins, 1983)</ref>, consumer safety (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.60,531.82,56.91,7.17" target="#b27">Laughery, 2006)</ref>, pharmaceuticals (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,448.10,531.82,71.02,7.17" target="#b11">Chan &amp; Chan, 2013)</ref>, and even libraries (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,358.87,542.25,92.57,7.17" target="#b32">Polger &amp; Stempler, 2014)</ref>, research on waste disposal signs has been limited. Specifically, since an initial study by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,532.69,552.74,24.91,7.17;1,306.60,563.17,129.45,7.17" target="#b4">Austin, Hatfield, Grindle and Bailey (1993)</ref> found that the presence of basic signs placed above waste disposal bins can itself increase recycling, the literature has focused largely on persuasive messaging, e.g. "do you leave your litter lying around?", and other design features that might motivate recycling behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.77,605.01,150.88,7.17;1,306.60,615.50,20.14,7.17" target="#b6">(Bateson, Callow, Holmes, Roche, &amp; Nettle, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,329.33,615.50,119.58,7.17" target="#b43">Werner, Rhodes, &amp; Partain, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,451.50,615.50,106.12,7.17;1,306.60,625.93,20.14,7.17" target="#b44">Werner, Stoll, Birch, &amp; White, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,331.20,625.93,142.42,7.17" target="#b45">Werner, White, Byerly, &amp; Stoll, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,478.09,625.93,79.55,7.17;1,306.60,636.42,52.44,7.17" target="#b26">de Kort, McCalley, &amp; Midden, 2008)</ref>. Critically, these studies neither evaluate the design factors of the signs themselves, nor do they investigate how signs might capture attention or communicate the information differently. The signage literature has adopted a four stage information-processing framework for how signs and labels can produce specific behavioral change: 1) engage attention; 2) facilitate comprehension; 3) modify beliefs and attitudes; 4) enhance motivation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,242.81,91.15,45.83,7.17;2,37.59,101.64,57.20,7.17" target="#b48">(Wogalter &amp; Laughery, 1996)</ref>. The literature around waste disposal signage has focused on the role of the later stages of this information-processing framework: beliefs and attitudes, and motivation. The first two stages (attention and comprehension) depend on basic design features of the signage that can impact early stages of cognitive processes in a waste disposal context, and they remain unexplored. The present study takes an initial step towards understanding how signs can optimally display information so that users can most efficiently and effectively perceive and comprehend the information presented.</p><p>As the motivation behind this study was to assist jurisdictions and institutions wishing to implement evidence-based standardization of waste disposal signage, we were primarily interested in resolving several debates that we found were common across local institutions implementing waste disposal signage. Common concerns included whether words or images were better in conveying the category of waste, whether consistent positioning of the signs was important, and whether signs should display prohibited items <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.58,268.99,78.09,7.17" target="#b1">(Andrews et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.87,268.99,37.72,7.17;2,37.59,279.43,54.89,7.17" target="#b7">Ben-Bassat &amp; Shinar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,94.56,279.43,64.30,7.17" target="#b9">Bohm et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.95,279.43,123.87,7.17" target="#b34">Schultz, Oskamp, &amp; Mainieri, 1995)</ref>. From these practical design questions we derived two broad directions that could be explored scientifically: 1) what type of waste disposal information should be presented; and 2) how the information should be presented. Underlying these themes was the larger question of whether basic design features can influence waste disposal behavior at all.</p><p>These questions intersect with the established literature on information provision from icons. It has long been noted that icons can communicate large amounts of information efficiently, and are not limited by language barriers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,138.33,373.59,137.36,7.17" target="#b24">(Isherwood, McDougall, &amp; Curry, 2007)</ref>. In altering attention and comprehension aspects of the information-processing framework, researchers look to manipulate three characteristics of the visual stimuli: complexity, concreteness, and familiarity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,37.59,415.43,151.19,7.17" target="#b30">(McDougall, Reppa, Kulik, &amp; Taylor, 2016)</ref>. Generally, images that are simpler result in quicker performance, with more complex images resulting in slower response times. There is also a correlation between complexity and familiarity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,132.66,446.84,125.28,7.17" target="#b19">(Forsythe, Mulhern, &amp; Sawey, 2008)</ref>, though both factors also independently predict performance (with familiarity generally being the most important). Concreteness refers to how pictorial an image is, or how closely it connects or represents the realworld object it is depicting. There remains some debate in the literature about the importance of concreteness in impacting user performance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,37.59,509.60,85.88,7.17" target="#b30">(McDougall et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Recent theory has suggested that easing the information processing of icons (i.e. having simple, concrete, and familiar icons) can not only improve performance (e.g. accuracy and response times) but can also impact subjective evaluations and preferences <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.86,551.43,83.96,7.17" target="#b30">(McDougall et al., 2016)</ref>. That is, not only can changing the basic characteristics of visual stimuli make performance easier, but it can also make participants like it more.</p><p>The practical questions that motivated our study dovetail with the theoretical questions about the characteristics of visual stimuli, and whether characteristics like complexity and concreteness can impact performance in a novel contextwaste disposalyet to be explored in the icon literature.</p><p>To address these practical and theoretical questions, we created an experimental paradigm utilizing motion tracking technology and a large tabletop touchscreen where participants would be shown an item to dispose (e.g. an apple core) and they would then have to throw the item out by touching the proper waste category (compost, paper, recycling, or garbage). Waste categories were represented on the tabletop touchscreen by clear visual signs. We compared the impact of the following factors on sorting behavior: the use of pictures, icons, and texts as signage (Experiment 1), the consistency of bin positions and the presence of permitted and prohibited items (Experiments 2 &amp; 3). We should note that although the relative benefit of icons vs. pictures (vs. words) on human sorting behavior may seem intuitive, the empirical evidence is far from clear-cut. Designing effective visual signage in many ways is about striking the proper balance between presenting too little and too much information to guide the sorting behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.23,122.56,126.95,7.17" target="#b13">Cole, Hammond, &amp; McCool, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.68,122.56,56.12,7.17" target="#b22">Hollnagel, 2009</ref>). The pictures and icons used in our experiments were developed with the diverse images commonly found throughout the local municipalities' waste disposal signage. We used the same four waste streams that were ubiquitous on the campus of University of British Columbia and in the local communities. The sorting rules in the experiments followed the sorting guidelines in the City of Vancouver. As the participants would have to reach out to the sign to dispose an item, the task approximates the reaching gestures commonly used when throwing out a waste item in the real world. We reasoned that natural responses such as these might generalize more readily to actual sorting behavior outside the laboratory, yet the tabletop set-up allowed us to easily manipulate the design of the signs while controlling for all other external factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experiment 1</head><p>We began by exploring whether different types of image renderings (pictures, icons, words) would be more effective at inducing proper waste disposal behavior. The literature suggests that signage information conveyed by images generally produce better outcomes than those by words only, which has led some regulators to replace word-only warning signs with images <ref type="bibr" coords="2,406.54,352.67,75.64,7.17" target="#b2">(Argo &amp; Main, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,485.46,352.67,72.18,7.17;2,306.60,363.10,48.02,7.17" target="#b20">Forsythe, Sheehy, &amp; Sawey, 2003)</ref>. We predicted, therefore, that images should produce faster and more accurate responses compared to words.</p></div>

The present series of experiments were grounded on this foundation. Furthermore, a power analysis was conducted using G*Power <ref type="bibr" coords="2,388.12,478.19,142.69,7.17" target="#b18">(Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007)</ref>. Given a partial eta squared of 0.41 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,416.80,488.68,140.82,7.17">(Luo, Zelenika, &amp; Zhao, under review;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.60,499.11,145.80,7.17" target="#b55">Zhao, Al-Aidroos, &amp; Turk-Browne, 2013</ref>) derived from our previous work using a similar interface and experimental design with four within-subjects conditions, a minimum of 20 participants was required to have 90% power (alpha = 0.05) to reveal an effect. Thus, we recruited at least 20 participants in each experiment. Variation in the number of participants beyond this threshold is inevitable based on how the University of British Columbia subject pool operates, where studies are open for a set period of time, and students are free to sign-up for course credit or financial remuneration both for the purpose of contributing to new data acquisition and in order to gain personal insights into how research investigations operate. Thus, if the number of volunteers exceeds our pre-set target, we allow them to participate and, of course, include their data in our analyses.</p><p>In our first experiment forty-three university students (mean age = 23.42 years, sd = 4.94, range = 18-42; 13 male; 40 right handed) participated in a 30-min session for course credit or $5 CAD. We excluded one subject because of an equipment failure that occurred during testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Stimuli</head><p>Four waste categories were used: garbage, recycling, paper, and compost. Each waste category was represented by a sign. Signs were depicted using four different image renderings (standard pictures, black and white pictures, icons, or words). These image renderings allowed us to manipulate the level of complexity and concreteness of each sign. Standard pictures were the most complex and most concrete (most accurately portrayed real-world items). Black and white pictures were less complex though still displayed the same level of concreteness as standard colour pictures. Icons meanwhile were less complex and concrete than the pictures (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,147.86,380.46,18.65,7.17" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). These signs displayed items that were representative of the category and also found commonly in waste disposal signs in the local area. As such, only a few items to be disposed of matched the items displayed on the signs. Not all items displayed on signs were items participants were tasked to dispose of. Participants were tasked to dispose of a total of 96 items during testing, with 24 items drawn from each of the four categories: compost, garbage, paper, and recycling categories. The items to be disposed of were presented as word labels to limit ambiguity of what the items were. See Appendix 1 for a list of the items that were to be disposed of and the items that were displayed on the signs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Apparatus</head><p>A motion tracking setup was used for this experiment, which consisted of 6 motion tracking cameras (NaturalPoint Optitrack, VR100:R2), each with a 100 Hz sampling rate and 640 × 480 pixels spatial resolution. These cameras emitted infrared signals to detect a small marker ball that was attached to a participants' index finger with an adjustable strap. The stimuli were projected onto a tabletop from a ceiling-mounted projector (Dell M410HD) with display settings of 1024 × 768 pixels and 60 Hz refresh rate. The physical size of this projected area on the table was 92 cm × 69.25 cm. See <ref type="figure" coords="3,506.50,404.43,20.41,7.17" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> for how the signs were displayed and the dimensions of the projected area. Motion tracking data, including reaction times and reach times, were collected and the experiment was controlled using MATLAB. See <ref type="figure" coords="3,537.62,435.78,20.01,7.17" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> for a depiction of the Optitrack setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Procedure</head><p>Participants 1 were seated at the touch table, and were fitted with an adjustable marker on the index finger of their dominant hand. On each trial, a home box appeared first. Participants held their index finger down within the home box for 1 s, after which an item to be disposed of would be randomly selected and appear 6.6 cm above the home box. Participants were given ample time (3-4 s) to decide what waste category the item belonged to, before the different waste bins appeared in any one of four possible locations. In this way any variation between bin selection (e.g., words vs. images) could be attributed to differences in processing the bin. Participants then indicated which Waste Category the item should be deposited in by reaching out and touching down on the sign, roughly simulating a natural "throwing away" gesture. To emphasize that we wanted participants to behave naturally, we asked participants to "imagine themselves placing various waste items in the right disposal bin" by reaching towards and touching down on the correct sign. We emphasized that both the speed and accuracy of their reaches were important. Note that if participants lifted their finger outside the home box before the bins appeared, the trial ended prematurely and the participant received a "too early" message; that item's   1 Half of the participants in the study underwent a cognitive load manipulation, whereby on each trial they were asked to hold in working memory a various set of different colors. However, this load manipulation had no impact on sorting performance in this experiment and the conditions were collapsed for all subsequent analyses. position in the sequence would then be re-randomized along with the remaining items to be disposed of. There was a 2.5 s interval between trials.</p><p>2.1.5. Data handling "Efficiency score" was our main dependent variable <ref type="bibr" coords="4,241.00,114.85,47.64,7.17;4,37.59,125.34,46.19,7.17" target="#b40">(Townsend &amp; Ashby, 1983)</ref>. This measure was computed by dividing the total reaction time (the time it took from when a participant lifted his or her finger from the home box to when a sign was touched) by accuracy (the proportion of accurate responses). It is well established that response accuracy is often sacrificed in the name of response speed, known as the speed-accuracy trade off <ref type="bibr" coords="4,140.37,177.61,148.26,7.17;4,37.59,188.10,71.45,7.17" target="#b8">(Bogacz, Wagenmakers, Forstmann, &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,112.14,188.10,64.39,7.17" target="#b46">Wickelgren, 1977)</ref>. Efficiency scores seek to normalize this trade off by taking into account both reaction time and accuracy, allowing us to normalize different speed-accuracy response strategies (e.g., maximizing speed at the cost of response accuracy versus sacrificing speed in order to respond accurately). Thus, for example, if a person took 1 s (1000 ms) to respond but only got half of the responses right, their efficiency score would be 2000 (1000 ms/ 0.5 = 2000); whereas if another person took 1 s to respond but got all the responses correct, their score would be 1000 (1000 ms/1 = 1000). Thus, better performance is reflected in a more efficient (smaller) efficiency score. Response times were trimmed according to a hybrid recursive trimming method in order to remove outliers including trials with extremely short or long response times <ref type="bibr" coords="4,204.21,313.61,84.43,7.17;4,37.59,324.10,19.32,7.17">(Van Selst &amp; Joliceour, 1994)</ref>.

Specifically, we examined whether waste disposal signs were more effective when they consisted of images or words. Based on previous literature, we predicted that images would fare better than word-only signs as, for example, traffic signs with symbols are not only learned more quickly, but also produce more accurate recall compared to word traffic signs <ref type="bibr" coords="4,37.59,653.94,124.32,7.17" target="#b42">(Walker, Nicolay, &amp; Stearns, 1965)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Discussion</head><p>This experiment revealed that iconic yes/no signs results in less efficient response decisions than iconic yes signs. In contrast, response efficiency for pictures was the same for yes/no and yes signs. This  pattern of results confirms the observation hinted at in Experiment 2. Why should yes/no iconic signs interfere with response efficiency? We suggest that it is because the colour used to convey yes/no response information is especially salient for iconic signs, as they are otherwise colourless, drawing attention to colour and away from the waste category form information. In short, the conspicuity of the colour information in the iconic renderings can distract attention away from the form information that is necessary to first make the correct waste category selection. There is a wealth of controlled studies demonstrating precisely this result (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,128.47,153.91,60.62,7.17" target="#b37">Theeuwes, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,192.36,153.91,96.28,7.17" target="#b38">Theeuwes &amp; Godijn, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,37.59,164.40,151.44,7.17" target="#b39">Theeuwes, Kramer, &amp; Kingstone, A., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,191.73,164.40,46.09,7.17" target="#b53">Yantis, 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">General discussion</head><p>Motivated by questions commonly encountered in jurisdictions and institutions seeking to reduce waste, this study sought to examine how signage might affect waste disposal behavior in two ways: 1) what type of information is conveyed; and 2) how the information is conveyed.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we found that signs conveying information with images or icons are better than signs conveying information with only words. In Experiments 2 we found that displaying prohibited items along with permitted items did not yield a net benefit relative to signs that only contained permitted items, although consistent positioning of the four waste categories enhances sorting performance. Experiment 3 picked up on the possibility that when bins are randomized, yes/no signs may actual interfere with response efficiency for iconic signs. This possibility was tested, and confirmed, in Experiment 3.</p><p>Collectively our experiments show that some basic design features of signs can have an impact on sorting performance, specifically, whether the signs use words or images and whether the signs are consistently positioned. The increased sorting efficiency (improved accuracy and reduced response time) suggests a potential lower ecological footprint because higher sorting accuracy means reduced contamination in the waste streams, particularly in the compost, recycling, and garbage streams. Less contamination in the compost, recycling, and garbage streams means that there is more waste diverted from landfill and more materials to be re-used <ref type="bibr" coords="7,246.13,442.93,42.51,7.17;7,37.59,453.41,115.15,7.17" target="#b23">(Hoornweg, Bhada-tata, &amp; Kennedy, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,157.55,453.41,127.18,7.17" target="#b54">Zelenika, Moreau, &amp; Zhao, 2018)</ref>. However, not all changes have a profound impact. We found that adding prohibited items to the signs did not improve a signs' ability to influence response decisions, and can, in the case of icon signs, interfere with response behavior. On this latter point we think it prudent to emphasize that there may also be a point at which yes/no signs for pictures also compromise decision making. Yes/no signs convey more information than yes signs alone, and too much information can result in less attention being devoted to any one item, and with this the ability to comprehend and retain information declinesi.e., "information overload" <ref type="bibr" coords="7,116.45,558.01,69.63,7.17" target="#b13">(Cole et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,190.21,558.01,98.39,7.17;7,37.59,568.44,19.67,7.17" target="#b33">Rosenholtz, Li, &amp; Nakano, 2007)</ref>. It seems inevitable that displaying too much information on a waste disposal sign (e.g., displaying a large number of permitted and prohibited items) will, at a certain point, lead to information overload and impair performance. To the extent that yes/no signs double the amount of information on yes signs, the former risk impairing sorting performance more than the latter. 5 In our view, waste disposal signage should be simple and comply with ergonomic principles like being brighter, having less clutter, and having larger font <ref type="bibr" coords="7,234.84,641.70,53.79,7.17;7,37.59,652.13,20.54,7.17" target="#b2">(Argo &amp; Main, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,62.53,652.13,103.25,7.17" target="#b7">Ben-Bassat &amp; Shinar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,170.25,652.13,118.39,7.17;7,37.59,662.62,60.23,7.17" target="#b10">Campbell, Cowley, Mayhorn, &amp; Wogalter, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,102.57,662.62,164.52,7.17" target="#b47">Wogalter, Conzola, &amp; Smith-Jackson, 2002)</ref>.

First, our study, while controlled, struck an important balance between control and real-world relevance, by using sorting signage drawn from the local community and sorting guidelines from the City of Vancouver, which itself is extraordinarily diverse. Second, our paradigms used motion tracking technology which required participants to pick up the item and place it into one of the bins. This paradigm was designed to mimic real-world sorting behavior. Finally, the effects observed in our study reflect differences between conditions within the same participants (i.e., within-subject effects), which means that our findings are less susceptible to individual or cultural differences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Conclusion and future directions</head><p>Our experiments reveal that basic design features of waste signage can influence the efficiency of sorting behavior. We began answering questions found commonly across institutions seeking to standardize waste signage in order to facilitate sorting behavior. Despite our experiments being only exploratory in nature, they help inform institutions in their decisions regarding the creation of effective waste disposal signage.</p><p>This series of experiments represents an initial and exploratory step towards creating standardized waste disposal signage. Many questions remain unanswered. For example, there appear to be cultural differences in the comprehension of traffic signs <ref type="bibr" coords="7,467.49,520.03,72.96,7.17" target="#b35">(Shinar et al., 2003)</ref>. Do such differences also exist in waste disposal signage? This is an important question for highly multicultural jurisdictions such as New York and Chicago in the USA, and Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. Subsequent studies could also look at whether increasing the ease of information processing of waste disposal signs can also influence the subjective appeal of the signs and the task, as has been recently demonstrated in other contexts <ref type="bibr" coords="7,409.55,593.28,84.24,7.17" target="#b30">(McDougall et al., 2016)</ref>. Making both the task of disposing waste easier and more attractive can have profound practical implications. Another useful next step will be to test how waste signage influences behavior in uncontrolled real-world settings, as opposed to the present controlled environment (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,529.85,635.12,27.79,7.17;7,306.59,645.55,43.93,7.17" target="#b25">Kline &amp; Beitel, 1994)</ref>, since waste disposal behavior in the real world can differ drastically from experimental settings <ref type="bibr" coords="7,443.39,656.04,114.22,7.17;7,306.59,666.47,67.00,7.17" target="#b52">(Wu, DiGiacomo, Lenkic, Wong, &amp; Kingstone, 2016)</ref>. Critically, the present study provides an empirical framework within which findings in the natural world can be contextualized.</p><p>The impact of "familiarity" of signs has yet to be explored in the waste disposal context. Given literature suggesting that familiarity is perhaps the most important characteristic of icons in impacting user performance, the study and creation of standardized waste disposal signs are, in our view, critically important. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,37.59,711.57,144.69,6.45;1,37.59,721.15,289.27,6.45"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.07.009 Received 13 March 2018; Received in revised form 25 June 2018; Accepted 30 July 2018</figDesc></figure>

4 When we analyzed the ANOVA including the between groups factor of yes/ 

no positioning (yes/no vs. no/yes), we found no significant effects or interac-
tions involving this manipulation (all p values &gt; .16), thus we collapsed the 
group variable and analyzed Sign Style x Image Rendering.
