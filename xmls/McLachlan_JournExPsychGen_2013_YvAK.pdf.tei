<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To date, no consensus exists in the literature as to theories of consonance and dissonance. Experimental data collected over the last century have raised questions about the dominant theories that are based on frequency relationships between the harmonics of music chords. This study provides experimental evidence that strongly challenges these theories and suggests a new theory of dissonance based on relationships between pitch perception and recognition. Experiment 1 shows that dissonance does not increase with increasing numbers of harmonics in chords as predicted by Helmholtz's (1863/1954) roughness theory, nor does it increase with fewer pitch-matching errors as predicted by Stumpf's (1898) tonal fusion theory. Dissonance was strongly correlated with pitch-matching error for chords, which in turn was reduced by chord familiarity and greater music training. This led to the proposition that long-term memory templates for common chords assist the perception of pitches in chords by providing an estimate of the chord intervals from spectral information. When recognition mechanisms based on these templates fail, the spectral pitch estimate is inconsistent with the period of the waveform, leading to cognitive incongruence and the negative affect of dissonance. The cognitive incongruence theory of dissonance was rigorously tested in Experiment 2, in which nonmusicians were trained to match the pitches of a random selection of 2-pitch chords. After 10 training sessions, they rated the chords they had learned to pitch match as less dissonant than the unlearned chords, irrespective of their tuning, providing strong support for a cognitive mechanism of dissonance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theories of Consonance and Dissonance</head><p>In 1863, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,348.70,583.04,61.20,7.91">Helmholtz (1863</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,413.94,583.04,16.18,7.91" target="#b21">Helmholtz ( /1954</ref> proposed that dissonance was created by the beating of closely tuned tones that give rise to perceptual roughness. The overtone frequencies of most naturally occurring tonal sounds are arranged in the harmonic series (i.e., at integer multiples of the fundamental or lowest frequency component). For tunings at integer ratios, the frequency differences between some pairs of harmonics are at zero while the differences for all other pairs are at local maxima ( <ref type="figure" coords="1,466.34,660.04,30.59,7.91">Figure 1</ref>). Helmholtz proposed that Western music intervals occur at close to integer ratios to minimize roughness due to the beating of closely tuned pairs of harmonics. <ref type="figure" coords="1,378.35,693.04,30.54,7.91">Figure 1</ref> shows the relationships of harmonics that minimize beating and roughness. Specifically, two complex harmonic tones are tuned at a frequency ratio of 3:2, so the frequency differences between both the 600-and 1,200-Hz harmonics are zero, while the differences for all other pairs are at local maxima. A small mistuning of either complex leads to beating between the pairs of harmonics at 600 and 1,200 Hz, which would increase the perceived roughness and dissonance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,225.10,286.03,62.96,7.91;2,48.00,297.03,19.37,7.91" target="#b53">(Plomp &amp; Levelt, 1965)</ref>.</p><p>In 1898, Stumpf proposed the tonal fusion theory of consonance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,319.03,96.76,7.91" target="#b16">(DeWitt &amp; Crowder, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,146.77,319.03,52.76,7.91" target="#b17">Ebeling, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,201.54,319.03,59.25,7.91" target="#b20">Guernsey, 1928;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,262.79,319.03,25.25,7.91;2,48.00,330.03,21.00,7.91" target="#b23">Huron, 1991)</ref> in which consonance is associated with perceptual fusion of pitches of harmonic complex tones that are tuned to integer frequency ratios and so have pairs of harmonics at common frequencies. In <ref type="figure" coords="2,76.30,363.03,29.15,7.91">Figure 1</ref>, perceptual fusion would lead to the perception of a single harmonic complex with a fundamental at 100 Hz, despite the absence of some harmonics and the fundamental (dotted lines in <ref type="figure" coords="2,58.26,396.03,30.00,7.91">Figure 1</ref>). According to Stumpf's theory, the similarity of the perceived stimulus in <ref type="figure" coords="2,129.25,407.03,30.92,7.91">Figure 1</ref> to a harmonic series could lead to misrecognition of the stimulus as a single harmonic complex as this is a more parsimonious sensory experience. Fusion is most likely to occur for music chords tuned close to small-integer ratios since they share more harmonics.</p><p>In 1928, Martha Guernsey reported a series of experiments that presented substantial challenges for both Helmholtz's roughness theory of dissonance and Stumpf's tonal fusion theory of consonance. Guernsey found no evidence that changing stimulus timbre affected consonance as predicted by these theories; instead she found strong effects of music training on consonance. This discovery led her to suggest that consonance was associated with familiarity for commonly used music chords.</p><p>In 1974, Terhardt distinguished the perception of sensory dissonance for simultaneous tones when independent of a music context from musical dissonance that is experienced when music deviates from an expected pattern of chords or notes. In the Western music tradition, these expected sequential patterns have been formulated as functional harmony <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.90,605.03,49.21,7.91" target="#b51">(Piston, 1948)</ref>. Experiment 1 in this article is concerned with developing and testing a neurocognitive model of sensory dissonance experienced for music chords in the absence of a musical context. In this experiment, we re-examined the dominant theories of dissonance in light of modern findings by extending the experimental paradigm employed by Guernsey. The results will be presented in four parts. Part 1 examines a key prediction of Helmholtz's theory that dissonance increases with the number of harmonics in the stimulus due to greater beating and roughness when chords are not tuned to simple integer ratios. Part 2 describes a new test of Stumpf's theory of consonance, in which the ability to match pitch height is predicted to be less certain for stimuli with greater tonal fusion. In Part 3, these pitch-matching results provide experimental support for a recent theory of concurrent pitch processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,473.28,110.03,68.90,7.91" target="#b36">(McLachlan, 2011)</ref>, which leads, in Part 4, to the development and testing of a new model of dissonance that incorporates pitch-matching mechanisms. In Experiment 2, we tested this model by training nonmusicians to match the pitches in a random selection of 2-pitch chords over 10 sessions. We then compared their dissonance ratings for these chords with dissonance ratings for the remaining 2-pitch chords.</p></div>

Seventy-one adults (46 women, 25 men; mean age œ≠ 22 years, SD œ≠ 7 years) participated in the study, and the data from 66 of these participants were included in the analyses after screening (see Procedure). Participants included undergraduate and postgraduate students from the University of Melbourne and the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, as well as adults recruited from the general community. The mean number of years of participants' formal education was 14.6 (SD œ≠ 2.4). All participants completed a questionnaire about their music experience (J. W. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,331.23,363.04,198.93,7.91" target="#b73">Wilson, Lusher, Martin, Rayner, &amp; McLachlan, 2012)</ref> and reported having normal hearing and no serious neurological conditions. Information about the study was provided and written informed consent was obtained.</p><p>When the level of music training was a variable in analyses, the participants were divided into three groups on the basis of their years of formal music training on a pitched musical instrument. <ref type="figure" coords="2,306.00,440.04,30.26,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows the distribution of formal music training across the participants in the study. It indicates that they fell naturally into one of three groups: (a) no training (0 years of training; n œ≠ 14, three men, 11 women), (a) low training (up to 12 years of training; M training œ≠ 6 years; n œ≠ 40, 15 men, 25 women), and (c) high training (more than 15 years of training; M training œ≠ 19 years; n œ≠ 12, four men, eight women).</p><p>Materials. Three types of stimuli were created to investigate whether dissonance increased systematically with the number of harmonics present in the stimuli. They were (a) pure tones, (b) odd harmonic complexes composed of a fundamental plus equalamplitude harmonics at three and five times the frequency of the fundamental, and (c) full harmonic complexes composed of a <ref type="figure" coords="2,48.00,184.48,27.09,6.86">Figure 1</ref>.

Six 2-pitch and six 3-pitch chords with intervals of up to eight semitones were created from each stimulus type <ref type="table" coords="3,172.51,99.04,33.69,7.91" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, generating 36 chord stimuli in all. These chords provide a representative sample of varying dissonance and familiarity in accordance with categorizations of chord dissonance and chord usage in Western music <ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,143.04,67.00,7.91" target="#b28">(Krumhansl, 1990)</ref>. Each chord was presented a sufficient number of times to allow pitch matching of each pitch in the chord in separate presentations in different blocks (see Procedure). In addition to the chords, three single-pitch stimuli of each stimulus type were presented for comparison with pitch-matching distributions for the chords (nine 1-pitch stimuli in all). This led to a total of 99 stimulus presentations. The pitches of the stimuli were evenly distributed within the Western chromatic scale over the range of 220 -466 Hz (A 3 to A # 4 ). Procedure. For each stimulus presentation, participants were first asked to match one of the pitches in the stimulus and then to rate the familiarity and the dissonance of the stimulus on separate Likert-type scales. All stimuli were presented to participants individually in an anechoic chamber at a sound pressure level of 70 œÆ 2 dB through two loudspeakers located on either side of a computer monitor (1 m in front and 0.5 m apart). Trials were presented randomly over three blocks of 25 trials and one block of 24 trials, with each block lasting approximately 10 min. Breaks were provided between blocks to minimize fatigue effects. The pitch-matching task was adapted from B. C. J. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,248.11,352.04,39.92,7.91;3,48.00,363.04,58.62,7.91" target="#b44">Moore and Glasberg (1985)</ref>. Before the presentation of each chord, participants were informed of the number of pitches (one, two, or three) and the target pitch they were required to match (lowest, middle, or highest). Target stimuli were followed by a single probe tone pitch that was repeated three times, as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="3,232.45,407.04,30.29,7.91" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. Bidirectional lateral movement of a computer mouse by the participants altered the pitch of the probe tones (right movement increased pitch). The target stimulus and probe tones were repeated until participants clicked the mouse to indicate when they thought the probe tone matched the target, and the cycle was terminated. Purpose-built computer software was used to present the stimuli and record task responses. The software distributed 800 screen pixels evenly between 200 and 500 Hz, providing a frequency resolution of 0.375 Hz per pixel. Pitch matching of all component pitches in each stimulus was tested over 99 separate trials, pseu-dorandomly ordered so that concurrent presentations of the same chord were avoided.</p><p>At the completion of each pitch-matching trial, a rating screen appeared on the computer monitor for participants to grade the dissonance and familiarity of the target stimuli. Two separate 5-point Likert-type scales were used to measure perceived familiarity (1 œ≠ not familiar, 5 œ≠ very familiar) and perceived dissonance (1 œ≠ not dissonant, 5 œ≠ very dissonant). Dissonance was described to the participants as an experience that may be related to perceived roughness, harshness, unpleasantness, or difficulty in listening to the sound.</p><p>Prior to the experimental trials, participants completed a questionnaire to collect demographic, health, and music background data (S. J. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,345.04,220.03,156.78,7.91" target="#b75">Wilson, Pressing, Wales, &amp; Pattison, 1999)</ref>. All participants were also tested for absolute pitch ability using an established pitch-naming task (J. W. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,423.71,242.03,72.53,7.91" target="#b73">Wilson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,499.08,242.03,46.94,7.91;3,306.00,253.03,159.11,7.91" target="#b74">S. J. Wilson, Lusher, Wan, Dudgeon, &amp; Reutens, 2009</ref>), but no participant scored above chance (greater than 10 out of 50 correct responses). Participants then completed three practice trials on 2-and 3-pitch chords with assistance from the investigator to ensure adequate task comprehension, followed by a series of screening trials using pure tone stimuli. The screening continued up to a maximum of 10 trials with supervision until participants had accurately pitch matched a pure tone to within two semitones on three successive trials. Data from five participants who could not pass the screening task were excluded from analyses.</p></div>

These chords contained either an upper interval of an octave (twice the frequency of the middle pitch) or a lower interval of an octave and an upper interval of a fifth (two and three times the frequency of the lowest pitch), and so effectively participants were presented with a single harmonic series of varying harmonic amplitudes for these intervals.

This suggests that for unfamiliar chords, pitch-number estimation is influenced by the density of spectral components in the stimulus. This may result in lower pitch-number estimation for 3-pitch stimuli when the number of harmonics is reduced, but not for 2-pitch stimuli since 1-pitch stimuli are easily recognized and distinguished from 2-pitch stimuli.</p><p>Aims and hypotheses. Since pitch-number estimation has not provided conclusive evidence for the tonal fusion theory of consonance, a new paradigm was developed to test this theory in the current study. Tonal fusion should lead to more pitch-matching errors for consonant chords as participants attempt to match the pitch of these chords to the fundamental frequency of the partial harmonic series produced by tonal fusion (see <ref type="figure" coords="5,221.38,594.03,30.31,7.91">Figure 1</ref>) or some octave of this fundamental frequency. We investigated the accuracy of matching the probe tone to each pitch in a range of chords traditionally considered to be consonant or dissonant and hypothesized that if tonal fusion decreases perceived dissonance, then pitch-matching errors will be greater for chords rated as less dissonant.</p><p>Results. Since no effect for stimulus type was found for dissonance ratings in Part 1, dissonance ratings were collapsed across the three stimulus types.

However, in this analysis, we were interested in the proportion of stimulus presentations in which the two pitch-estimation mechanisms were congruent. Thus, we used the percentage of pitch estimations that fell within the resolution of periodicity-based pitch processing. Since highly trained musicians make fewer recognition and attentional errors <ref type="figure" coords="8,71.92,429.04,35.92,7.91">(Figure 7)</ref>, we determined the precision of periodicity processing from their pitch-matching distribution for 1-pitch stimuli, defined as two standard errors from the target pitch.

The large number of comparisons and the graduated differences between chords show a general pattern of findings that is summarized in online supplemental <ref type="table" coords="9,75.55,110.04,26.92,7.91" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Specifically pitch-matching accuracy was significantly poorer for the chords that were rated as significantly less familiar across all training groups. The order of familiarity ratings shown here closely follows the order of chord usage in Western music listed in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,104.99,154.04,65.48,7.91" target="#b28">Krumhansl (1990)</ref>. Pearson's correlations were also undertaken to measure relationships between familiarity and pitch-matching accuracy. The overall correlation between mean familiarity ratings and the percentage of correct pitch-matching estimations collapsed across all chord tunings and levels of music training was strong and significant (r œ≠ .96, p œΩ .01). This relationship held when separate correlations were performed for each level of training (none, r œ≠ .73, p œΩ .01; low, r œ≠ .87, p œΩ .001; and high, r œ≠ .86, p œΩ .001) demonstrating that familiarity ratings made a significant contribution to the variance of pitch-matching accuracy for chords independent of the level of training. The observation that the strength of these correlations increased from nonmusicians to musicians reflects the large increase in the rates of correct pitch matches for chords rated as familiar by musicians shown in <ref type="figure" coords="9,218.08,308.04,28.95,7.91" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref>. To ensure the statistical robustness of the effects observed, we also computed correlations from the pitch-matching data set derived from each participant for each chord, which showed remarkably similar effects (none, r œ≠ .77, p œΩ .01; low, r œ≠ .89, p œΩ .01; high, r œ≠ .87, p œΩ .01). These data provide strong evidence for the first hypothesis: that familiarity of chords increases with music training and is strongly related to pitch-matching accuracy.</p><p>The second hypothesis-that pitch estimation for one target position (e.g., highest or lowest pitch) will be more accurate across all chords-was tested using a mixed between-and within-groups ANOVA with independent variables of target position (two levels) and music training group (three levels). The music training variable was included because of the significant differences in the accuracy of pitch estimation reported earlier. The ANOVA showed main effects for target position, F(1, 63) œ≠ 23.6, p œΩ .01, partial 2 œ≠ .27, and group, F(2, 63) œ≠ 13.8, p œΩ .01, partial 2 œ≠ .30, but no interaction. The means revealed that pitch-matching accuracy was consistently greater for the high-target pitch position (M œ≠ 35.19, SD œ≠ 24.65) than the low-target pitch position (M œ≠ 25.51, SD œ≠ 28.51). Inspection of the data for the middle pitches of the 3-pitch chords revealed that pitch-matching accuracy for this target pitch never exceeded the accuracy of either of the other target pitches (see <ref type="figure" coords="9,117.93,561.04,31.15,7.91">Figure 1</ref> in the online supplemental material). Consistent with the previous analysis, post hoc Bonferroni contrasts again showed greater pitch-matching accuracy for the group with high training than for the group with low training (p œΩ .01), and for the group with low training than for group with no training (p œΩ .01).</p><p>A further analysis was undertaken to evaluate the possibility that patterns of masking of harmonics could differentially affect the salience of the highest and lowest pitches. In auditory stimuli that contain harmonics that are not resolved by the cochlea, the auditory nerve activation associated with one harmonic could mask the activation associated with others <ref type="bibr" coords="9,167.28,682.04,85.70,7.91" target="#b77">(Zwicker &amp; Fastl, 1999)</ref>. Patterns of masking about a harmonic are asymmetrical and wider at higher frequencies. It follows that different levels of masking of harmonics associated with the highest and lowest pitches of chords of complex tones could differentially affect the salience of target pitches <ref type="bibr" coords="9,333.84,88.04,53.09,7.91" target="#b47">(Parncutt, 1989</ref>). Masking will have greater effect on pitch salience in stimuli with more harmonics and so should have more effect on pitch-matching accuracy for full harmonic complexes than for pure tones. A mixed between-and within-groups ANOVA was performed on pitch-matching accuracy as a function of the target position and stimulus type to test for an effect of masking. The analysis was performed on the pitch-matching data of the high-training group as the nonmusician group performance was close to chance. The ANOVA showed a main effect for target pitch position, F(1, 11) œ≠ 14.46, p œΩ .01, partial 2 œ≠ .57, with the percentage correct for the high pitch (M œ≠ 66.65, SD œ≠ 14.68) again greater than the low pitch (M œ≠ 46.70, SD œ≠ 25.06), but no main effect for stimulus type. Furthermore, no interaction between these variables was observed, suggesting that masking did not contribute to better performance for the higher target position.</p><p>Since pitch matching was more accurate for the high target pitch, according to <ref type="bibr" coords="9,375.74,264.04,67.31,7.91" target="#b36">McLachlan (2011)</ref> it is likely that these pitches are primed by a recognition mechanism. It follows that the attentional mechanism postulated in <ref type="figure" coords="9,425.53,286.04,31.51,7.91">Figure 6</ref> would prime the lower pitches in the chords. Attentional errors (pitch matches at the wrong target pitch) should then occur more often for the low-target positions than for the high-target position. We investigated this idea by computing the mean percentage of pitch estimates at nontarget pitches for high-and low-target positions across all chords, stimulus types, and musician levels and by comparing the mean error rates using a paired samples t test. Consistent with the McLachlan model of concurrent pitch processing, the mean percentage of pitch estimations at nontarget pitches was greater for the low target position (M œ≠ 15.62, SE œ≠ 1.16) than the high target position (M œ≠ 2.95, SE œ≠ 0.44), t(65) œ≠ 9.89, p œΩ .001, partial 2 œ≠ .60. Discussion. The finding that music training improves pitchmatching accuracy for common chords has not been previously reported, despite the importance of this skill for musicians. The strong positive correlation between familiarity and pitch-matching accuracy for chords provides new experimental support for the proposition that recognition mechanisms are integral to pitch processing <ref type="bibr" coords="9,334.94,495.04,64.87,7.91" target="#b35">(McLachlan, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,406.31,495.04,16.40,7.91" target="#b36">(McLachlan, , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,429.26,495.04,102.95,7.91" target="#b38">McLachlan &amp; Wilson, 2010)</ref>. In particular, the finding that fewer pitch-matching errors were made for the highest pitch of each chord, even in the absence of masking, provides strong support for the prediction that only one pitch in a chord can be directly estimated by recognition mechanisms <ref type="bibr" coords="9,306.00,550.04,68.78,7.91" target="#b36">(McLachlan, 2011)</ref>.

Finally, the mean percentage of pitch estimations at nontarget pitches was greater for the low-target position, which is consistent with these errors being associated with a subsequent attentional mechanism after the highest target pitch was primed by recognition mechanisms.</p><p>The effect of music training on pitch-matching accuracy for chords is consistent with improved identification of concurrent vowels with training reported by <ref type="bibr" coords="9,435.36,693.04,70.27,7.91" target="#b0">Alain et al.

Guernsey (1928) summarized psychological theories of consonance and dissonance found in the literature up to the early twentieth century. These ranged from theories of dissonance as a negative affect associated with stimulus unfamiliarity and ambiguity, to consonance as enculturation, to commonly used intervals. For example, H. T. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,155.27,341.04,50.44,7.91" target="#b45">Moore (1914)</ref> suggested that when a chord is first encountered, it may induce perceptual conflict that reduces as the ear becomes accustomed, until eventually hearing the chord becomes pleasurable. This pleasure then diminishes with repetition, leading musicians to explore new intervals. This theory accounts for slow changes in the perceived dissonance of music intervals over time in Western music <ref type="bibr" coords="10,187.45,407.04,62.10,7.91" target="#b20">(Guernsey, 1928)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,57.00,418.04,67.67,7.91" target="#b20">Guernsey's (1928)</ref> experimental data showed striking increases in pleasantness ratings for more common music intervals in musicians, leading her to conclude that training and musical genre are important factors that condition the perception of consonance. Recent research has confirmed Guernsey's finding that the ability to discriminate consonant and dissonant chords increases in individuals with music training <ref type="bibr" coords="10,152.87,484.04,80.01,7.91" target="#b6">(Brattico et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,236.22,484.04,51.83,7.91;10,48.00,495.04,33.25,7.91" target="#b34">McDermott et al., 2010)</ref>. In particular, <ref type="bibr" coords="10,138.01,495.04,89.88,7.91" target="#b34">McDermott et al. (2010)</ref> found that individual preference for harmonicity was strongly correlated with a preference for chords that are traditionally considered to be consonant, as well as the level of music training. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,57.00,539.04,104.50,7.91" target="#b57">Seashore and Mount (1918)</ref> suggested that the ability to perceive consonance is a general test of innate musical intellect and depends primarily on pitch discrimination ability. This idea has recently been supported by neurophysiological findings from <ref type="bibr" coords="10,48.00,583.04,157.38,7.91" target="#b49">Passynkova, Neubauer, and Scheich (2007)</ref>, who observed a positive correlation between stimulus dissonance and the EEG coherence of left anterior and right posterior brain regions, which in turn negatively correlated with stimulus familiarity ratings. This led Passynkova and colleagues to suggest that the inability to segregate closely tuned pitches may contribute to the experience of dissonance, since this would generate high stimulus ambiguity.</p><p>The McLachlan (2011) model of pitch processing in chords proposes that failure of recognition mechanisms would typically lead to pitch priming at frequencies unrelated to pitch estimates based on periodicity. Extending the proposition by <ref type="bibr" coords="10,236.24,693.04,51.78,7.91;10,48.00,704.03,33.25,7.91" target="#b49">Passynkova et al. (2007)</ref>, negative affect due to cognitive incongruity between the two pitch mechanisms could be experienced as dissonance when recognition mechanisms fail. Music training increases familiarity for commonly used chords, which would lead to less pitchmatching errors and so reduced dissonance for these chords. This prediction is consistent with the decrease in dissonance associated with music training for common chords observed by <ref type="bibr" coords="10,511.54,121.03,34.49,7.91;10,306.00,132.03,22.49,7.91" target="#b20">Guernsey (1928)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="10,334.93,132.03,94.22,7.91" target="#b6">Brattico et al.

An interval of two semitones is slightly less than a critical bandwidth and is the interval at which dissonance ratings begin to increase for decreasing frequency differences of both musical and nonmusical intervals of pure and complex tones <ref type="bibr" coords="10,437.37,253.03,62.55,7.91" target="#b20">(Guernsey, 1928;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,502.23,253.03,43.80,7.91;10,306.00,264.03,69.32,7.91" target="#b27">Kameoka &amp; Kuriyagawa, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,377.92,264.03,82.90,7.91" target="#b53">Plomp &amp; Levelt, 1965)</ref>.

Drawing together the findings of previous research and the three previous parts of Experiment 1, our hypothesis for Part 4 was that as music training increased, (a) dissonance would decrease for common chords due to higher familiarity and better pitch processing but (b) would increase for uncommon chords due to musicians' greater reliance on periodicity-based pitch information.</p><p>Results. <ref type="figure" coords="10,354.25,407.03,33.41,7.91">Figure 9</ref> shows the percentage of correct pitchmatching estimations (based on the œÆ0.41 semitone tolerance used in Part 3) and the mean dissonance ratings for each chord and level of training collapsed across the stimulus types (pure tones, odd and full harmonic complexes).

In keeping with the findings of Guernsey (1928) and later researchers, dissonance decreased for more familiar chords as music training increased.</p><p>To address the hypothesis that dissonance would decrease for common chords but increase for uncommon chords with music training, we first divided the chords according to well-established data on the frequency of chord usage in Western music <ref type="bibr" coords="11,48.00,154.04,67.37,7.91" target="#b28">(Krumhansl, 1990)</ref>. The common chord group comprised the major and minor third, perfect fifth, and minor sixth 2-pitch chords, and the major and minor triads <ref type="table" coords="11,173.62,176.04,34.34,7.91" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>. Bonferroni-adjusted single-sample t tests comparing mean familiarity ratings of the high training group for each chord to the median of the familiarity data across all chords confirmed that familiarity ratings were higher for the more common chords, as shown in <ref type="table" coords="11,233.67,220.04,26.86,7.91" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>To test the hypothesis, we first performed a mixed between-and within-groups ANOVA with independent variables of music training (three levels) and chord usage (two levels). Then we performed one-way ANOVA planned contrasts to investigate any significant main effects. Dissonance ratings were collapsed across stimulus type in accordance with the results in Part 1. This ANOVA showed an interaction between chord usage and training level, F(2, 63) œ≠ 3.61, p œΩ .05, partial 2 œ≠ .10, and main effects for both chord usage, F(1, 63) œ≠ 39.37, p œΩ .01, partial 2 œ≠ .39, and training level on dissonance ratings, F(2, 63) œ≠ 5.44, p œΩ .01, partial 2 œ≠ .15. To further investigate the interaction, we performed two one-way ANOVAs to examine the effect of training on dissonance ratings for the high-and low-usage chord groups; Dunnett's onetailed test was used to assess the direction of the predicted effects. For the high-usage chords, lower dissonance ratings were observed for the high training group than for either of the other groups (p œΩ .01), whereas for low-usage chords, higher dissonance ratings were observed for the low training group (p œ≠ .05) than for either of the other groups.</p><p>This pattern of data suggests that there is a general tendency toward higher dissonance ratings in the earlier stages of music training that is counteracted as musicians become highly trained and more familiar with music chords. These effects can be observed in <ref type="figure" coords="11,83.81,484.04,30.66,7.91">Figure 9</ref> as generally elevated dissonance ratings by the low-training group compared with the no-training group, but substantially reduced dissonance ratings by the high-training group for familiar chords in particular. To ensure that the time spent on the pitch-matching task did not influence dissonance or familiarity ratings, we recorded the average number of target sound repetitions in the pitch-matching trials for each chord by each music training group (see online supplemental <ref type="figure" coords="11,459.25,143.04,30.60,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). The average number of repetitions did not vary with chord type but generally increased with the level of music training, likely reflecting more care taken by highly trained musicians to make correct pitch matches.</p><p>Correlations between pitch-match accuracy and dissonance ratings were analyzed to further investigate the effect of music training on dissonance ratings. Overall, a significant negative correlation was found between the percentage of correct pitchmatching estimations and dissonance ratings collapsed across all chords and levels of music training (r œ≠ -.71, p œΩ .01). Furthermore, the correlations within each training group were all stronger than the overall correlation, being highest for the high-training group (r œ≠ -.90, p œΩ .01), followed by the low-training group (r œ≠ -.87, p œΩ .01) and the no-training group (r œ≠ -.73, p œΩ .05). This relationship also held when we obtained correlations using the percentage of correct responses for each participant (high, r œ≠ -.91, p œΩ .01; low, r œ≠ -.90, p œΩ .05; none, r œ≠ -.66, p œΩ .05). The increase in the strength of correlations as training level increased provides further support for the proposition that increasing reliance on periodicity information with music training increases negative affect when pitch matching is inaccurate.</p><p>Correlations between familiarity and dissonance ratings were also analyzed to investigate the proposition that dissonance is due to failure of recognition mechanisms to prime pitch processing, rather than simply a preference for familiar chords. Mean familiarity and dissonance ratings were strongly correlated (r œ≠ -.69, p œΩ .01) when collapsed across chord tuning and music training. However, when we controlled for the effect of the percentage of correct pitch-matching estimations using a partial correlation, this relationship was no longer significant (r œ≠ -.02).</p><p>An additional analysis showed that the percentage of pitch matches at nontarget stimulus pitches was not correlated to familiarity ratings (r œ≠ .09). This is consistent with the McLachlan (2011) model of concurrent pitch processing that postulates that lower frequency pitches in the chord are primed by a separate attentional mechanism that occurs after the initial recognition mechanism (as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="11,396.57,550.03,29.39,7.91">Figure 6</ref>) and with the analysis of relative rates of attentional errors for high-and low-target pitches reported in Part 3. Consistent with the cognitive incongruence model of dissonance, the percentage of these attentional errors was not correlated to dissonance ratings (r œ≠ .33), since spectral pitch estimates at nontarget stimulus pitches would still be congruent with waveform periodicity present in the stimulus. In other words, although the participant attended to the wrong pitch, periodicity information in the stimulus nevertheless coincided with the primed pitch estimate and so perceived dissonance was low instead of high.</p><p>Discussion. Across the analyses performed, the hypothesis that as the amount of music training increased, dissonance would decrease for common chords due to higher familiarity and pitchmatching accuracy was supported. The hypothesis that as the amount of music training increased, dissonance would increase for Note. Items are listed in descending order of the t statistic.

With respect to the proposed cognitive incongruence model of dissonance, this pattern of data is consistent with a general tendency toward higher dissonance ratings as musicians become better able to use periodicity-based pitch mechanisms. It is also consistent that this tendency is counteracted by better priming of periodicity pitch mechanisms for high-usage chords as musicians become more familiar with these chords. In other words, these data are consistent with the theory that dissonance is a negative affect related to a mismatch between pitch information arriving at the auditory cortex from recognition mechanisms and periodicity processing in the brainstem and mid brain. This mismatch would lead to disruption of perceptual and cognitive processing of pitch and increased stimulus ambiguity causing negative affect. <ref type="figure" coords="12,57.00,242.04,36.58,7.91" target="#fig_5">Figure 10</ref> summarizes the relationships among key variables that underpin the new model of dissonance and pitch matching described in Parts 3 and 4. The findings in Part 3 showed that increased chord usage and music training led to higher familiarity ratings, which, in turn, were strongly correlated with the percentage of correct pitch estimations. Music training also reduced the variance of pitch-matching estimates for single-pitch stimuli, likely reflecting increased reliance on periodicity pitch cues. For chords containing two-semitone intervals, poor auditory resolution likely contributed to poor pitch-matching performance and higher dissonance ratings even at the highest level of music training, so in keeping with <ref type="bibr" coords="12,102.07,363.04,96.36,7.91" target="#b53">Plomp and Levelt (1965)</ref>, we included auditory resolution as a separate causal factor in the model.</p><p>The findings in Part 4 showed that the percentage of correct pitch estimations (reflecting the congruence of spectral and periodicity pitch mechanisms) was inversely correlated with dissonance ratings. According to the cognitive incongruence model, this also has the effect of increasing dissonance for unfamiliar lowusage chords as musicians begin to rely on periodicity cues for pitch. Furthermore, attentional errors were not significantly correlated with familiarity ratings, suggesting that this source of error was independent of the initial spectral pitch mechanism. Finally, when we controlled for the relationship between familiarity and pitch-matching accuracy, there was no partial correlation between familiarity and dissonance ratings.</p><p>Long-standing and popular models of consonance and dissonance that are based on the physical properties of stimuli have been strongly refuted in this study, and a new model of consonance based on enculturation has emerged. This theory was developed from data generated in a cross-sectional, quasiexperimental paradigm in which participants were asked to make sequential judgments of pitch, familiarity, and dissonance for each stimulus. It is difficult to ascertain causality from a quasi-experimental design, and data collected over a sequence of tasks may have order effects; thus, it is clear that a longitudinal experimental design would provide a stronger test of our new theory. If nonmusicians are trained to match the pitches of a random subset of Western chords with intervals greater than two semitones, their dissonance ratings after training with these chords should be less than for unlearned chords, irrespective of the chords tuning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2: Learning Consonance</head><p>From a learning framework, theories of dissonance can be broadly classified into those in which dissonance is treated as an innate response and those in which it is treated as a learned response. Innate theories began with Pythagoras and include the theories of Helmholtz and Stumpf described in Parts 1 and 2. However, neither of these theories can account for changes in the perceived dissonance of chords that have occurred over the centuries since Western music was first notated <ref type="bibr" coords="12,471.85,397.20,63.71,7.91" target="#b20">(Guernsey, 1928)</ref> or for changes in perceived dissonance associated with music training observed in Experiment 1. Nor can these theories-since both are based on the harmonic relationships within a stimulus-explain the observation that dissonance ratings are the same for chords of pure tones and harmonic complexes as reported in Experiment 1 and observed by <ref type="bibr" coords="12,369.42,465.32,59.96,7.91" target="#b20">Guernsey (1928)</ref>. These points show the importance of a learned model, such as the cognitive incongruence model of dissonance.</p><p>The cognitive incongruence model proposes that dissonance ratings should decrease as people become more familiar with particular chords and better able to recognize the relationships between their constituent pitches, regardless of the chord tuning. This line of reasoning points to the involvement of recognition mechanisms based on spectral information in the first stages of pitch processing of chords <ref type="bibr" coords="12,404.40,567.49,69.34,7.91" target="#b36">(McLachlan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,476.34,567.49,65.57,7.91;12,306.00,578.85,38.07,7.91" target="#b38">McLachlan &amp; Wilson, 2010)</ref>. Conversely, if sensory dissonance is innate, then it would depend on chord tuning and be independent of an individual's ability to recognize the pitch intervals of a chord and match its pitches. To test the cognitive incongruence model of dissonance, we asked nonmusicians to undertake 10 daily training sessions on matching the pitches of five 2-pitch chords of pure tones that were randomly selected from intervals between two and 11 semitones. One-semitone intervals were not used as they are less than the spectral resolution of the cochlea, which is a physiological limit for processing the pitch of music chords <ref type="bibr" coords="12,509.55,681.02,36.49,7.91;12,306.00,692.37,63.71,7.91" target="#b1">(Assmann &amp; Paschall, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,371.70,692.37,64.59,7.91" target="#b36">McLachlan, 2011)</ref>.

Of the 24 nonmusicians who were recruited for the study, 19 completed all sessions and were included in the analysis (10 men, nine women; M age œ≠ 28.5 years, SD œ≠ 11.03). The mean number of years of formal education was 16.8 (SD œ≠ 2.22). Participants were given a laptop computer and a set of high-quality headphones to use at home for the duration of the study. Participants completed a practice diary and were prompted to practice every day by text messaging. Information about the study was provided, and written informed consent was obtained.</p><p>Procedure. The pitch-matching task was the same as that used in Experiment 1. In the first and last sessions (Sessions 1 and 10), participants listened to 100 stimuli that included 80 examples of the 10 two-pitch chords (eight pitch-shifted examples of each chord) and 20 single-pitch stimuli. Single-pitch stimuli were included as control stimuli to ensure that participants were performing the task to the best of their ability. Participants first matched one of the pitches and then received automated auditory and visual feedback on their error. In the automated feedback, participants heard each stimulus pitch individually followed by their response, and their error was displayed on a scale that ranged from -15 to 15 semitones, with zero signifying a perfect match. Finally, the stimulus was repeated, and participants were asked to rate the dissonance on a 5-point Likert scale. All participants were told that dissonance was an experience that may be related to perceived roughness, harshness, unpleasantness, or difficulty in listening to the stimulus.</p><p>In the intermediate training sessions (Sessions 2-9), each participant was required to pitch match 10 pure tones and 60 examples of five chords that were randomly selected from the original set of 10 chords. This meant that each participant continued to train on 12 pitch-shifted examples of a unique set of five randomly selected chords, while the remaining five unlearned chords were only presented in Sessions 1 and 10. Participants were not asked to rate the dissonance of stimuli in Sessions 2-9. The approximate duration of Sessions 1 and 10 was 40 min, and the approximate duration of Sessions 2-9 was 15 min.</p><p>Stimuli. The target stimuli were synthesized from 500-msduration pure tones with 50-ms onset and offset ramps at randomly selected Western music pitches between 220 and 880 Hz. Trials were pseudorandomly ordered so that presentations of the same chord were widely separated.</p></div>

Since participants had been exposed to all chords used in the study in Sessions 1 and 10, some learning occurred for the unlearned chords and likely resulted in the reduced pitch-matching errors in Session 10, despite the 8-day period between exposures to these chords. A paired-samples t test revealed no significant difference between the mean pitchmatching error for learned chords at Session 2 and unlearned chords at Session 10, confirming that the learning effect of the first exposure to these chords was largely maintained over the 8 intervening days. <ref type="figure" coords="14,57.00,330.04,34.87,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> also shows that the pitch matching for pure tones was better overall than for chords and generally improved over the 10 training sessions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The finding that improved pitch-matching accuracy for the learned chords was associated with decreased dissonance ratings for these chords, irrespective of their tuning, supports the cognitive incongruence model of dissonance. Learning for chords was faster between Sessions 1 and 2 compared with any other consecutive sessions, or the learning rate for pure tone stimuli.

However after 10 daily training sessions, the mean pitch-matching error for pure tones reduced to around 1.8 semitones, which is less than the resolution of the cochlea.

This finding is consistent with the well-established theory that pitch representations are refined by waveform periodicity information <ref type="bibr" coords="14,368.67,337.04,77.39,7.91" target="#b14">(de Cheveign√©, 2005)</ref> and suggests that the use of waveform periodicity information in pitch processing is learned.</p><p>The observed decrease in pitch-matching error for unlearned chords between Sessions 1 and 10 was not associated with decreased dissonance ratings. This is consistent with the finding in Part 4 of Experiment 1 that dissonance ratings generally increase for uncommon chords during early music training. According to the cognitive incongruence theory, increased reliance on periodicity processing in musicians creates stronger negative affect (dissonance) when recognition mechanisms fail and the periodicity information is incongruent with the expected pitch. It follows that the overall improvements in pitch-matching ability after training led to decreases in dissonance for both pure tones and learned chords, but not for the unfamiliar, unlearned chords for which recognition mechanisms were likely to fail.</p><p>The decrease in dissonance ratings for pure tones is difficult to reconcile with dissonance theories based on roughness <ref type="bibr" coords="14,502.80,513.03,43.24,7.91;14,306.00,524.03,21.00,7.91" target="#b21">(Helmholtz, 1954)</ref> or tonal fusion <ref type="bibr" coords="14,387.53,524.03,99.00,7.91" target="#b16">(DeWitt &amp; Crowder, 1987)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>This article makes a significant contribution by demonstrating that learning to perceive consonance involves cognitive processes. In particular, these include recognition mechanisms that facilitate the parsing of pitch information in more familiar stimuli. Support for a learned theory of dissonance does not imply that aversion to chords of less than two-semitone intervals is not innate, since these intervals are less than the spectral resolution of the cochlea <ref type="bibr" coords="14,519.57,693.04,26.50,7.91;14,306.00,704.04,56.31,7.91" target="#b53">(Plomp &amp; Levelt, 1965)</ref>.

Musical tunings based on numerical ratios of frequency have been widely used since Pythagoras introduced tuning based on successive 2/3 proportions of string length. It is not surprising then that simple mathematical relationships can be found between the harmonics of common Western music chords.

Since the Middle Ages, the accurate musical reproduction of intervals could be achieved by the removal of beat frequencies between harmonics, which fixes the intervals of the fundamental frequencies (or pitches) to small-integer ratios such as 5:4 and 3:2. The extensive use of this technique provides a plausible neurobiological basis for the evolution of the traditions of tuning and harmony to which Western musicians have become acculturated. More generally, chord and scale templates may form with repeated exposure to any tuning system provided it is sufficiently stable over time. This explains why modern Western musicians find chords based on the 12-tone equal-tempered scale consonant, despite deviations from small-integer ratio tunings.</p><p>Having been persuaded by the roughness model of sensory dissonance, <ref type="bibr" coords="15,93.92,550.03,59.52,7.91" target="#b66">Terhardt (1974)</ref> proposed a distinction between this form of dissonance and musical dissonance that was associated with the disruption of melodic and harmonic expectancies over time. <ref type="bibr" coords="15,71.61,583.03,60.10,7.91" target="#b15">Deutsch (1999)</ref> proposed that long-term memory templates for scales are hierarchically encoded with greater emphasis placed on more common musical intervals. <ref type="bibr" coords="15,229.09,605.03,58.96,7.91;15,48.00,616.03,54.53,7.91" target="#b38">McLachlan and Wilson (2010)</ref> subsequently showed how these templates could prime pitch processing in primary cortex via auditory shortterm memory to create melodic and harmonic expectancies.

This explains the modern preference for the equally tempered scale in Western music, despite few smallinteger ratio tunings and the diversity of music tunings that do not This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>conform to simple mathematical proportions that have emerged in isolated societies all over the world.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,306.00,705.70,240.04,7.03;2,306.00,715.70,89.53,7.03;2,7.70,556.60,7.03,14.22;2,7.70,522.39,7.03,31.55;2,7.70,514.39,7.03,5.34;2,7.70,473.51,7.03,38.22;2,7.70,462.85,7.03,8.00;2,7.70,450.41,7.03,9.78;2,7.70,416.21,7.03,31.54;2,7.70,368.66,7.03,44.89;2,7.70,328.22,7.03,37.78;2,7.70,318.89,7.03,6.66;2,7.70,304.68,7.03,11.55;2,7.70,295.35,7.03,6.66;2,7.70,285.13,7.03,7.56;2,7.70,264.70,7.03,17.78;2,7.70,227.15,7.03,34.89;2,17.70,567.25,7.03,14.22;2,17.70,544.60,7.03,19.99;2,17.70,536.60,7.03,5.34;2,17.70,506.39,7.03,27.55;2,17.70,484.62,7.03,19.11;2,17.70,472.63,7.03,9.33;2,17.70,460.19,7.03,9.78;2,17.70,430.42,7.03,27.10;2,17.70,417.10,7.03,10.66;2,17.70,407.77,7.03,6.66;2,17.70,395.33,7.03,9.78;2,17.70,360.22,7.03,32.45;2,17.70,344.23,7.03,13.33;2,17.70,330.02,7.03,11.55;2,17.70,322.02,7.03,5.34;2,17.70,309.14,7.03,10.22;2,17.70,300.25,7.03,6.22;2,17.70,290.04,7.03,7.55;2,17.70,245.60,7.03,41.78;2,17.70,216.50,7.03,26.44"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Frequency histogram representing years (yrs) of formal music training for all participants.
