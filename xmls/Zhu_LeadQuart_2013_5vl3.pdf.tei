<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examines the mediating effects of cognitive and affective trust on the relationship between follower perceptions of transformational leadership behavior and their work outcomes. Using data obtained from 318 supervisor-subordinate dyads from a manufacturing organization located in mainland China, structural equation modeling results revealed that affective trust fully mediated the relationships between transformational leadership and the work outcomes of followers, including their affective organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), and job performance. In contrast, cognitive trust negatively mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and follower job performance, and had insignificant effects on their affective organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviors. These findings highlight the importance of affective trust as a mechanism which translates transformational leadership into positive work outcomes for the organization.</p></div>

Previous empirical studies have found that trust fully mediates the impact of transformational leadership on organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,319.97,562.83,68.28,7.54" target="#b47">(Pillai et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,391.63,562.83,80.65,7.54" target="#b48">Podsakoff et al., 1990)</ref>, and job performance <ref type="bibr" coords="1,88.95,573.32,75.49,7.54" target="#b25">(Jung &amp; Avolio, 2000)</ref>. However, these studies have typically conceptualized trust as a uni-dimensional measure, and neglected the fact that it may consist of more than one dimension.</p><p>Recent developments in the literature indicate that there are two types of trust, one of which is exchange-based or relational in nature and the other character-based or cognitive in nature <ref type="bibr" coords="1,269.74,604.67,79.31,7.54" target="#b15">(Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,351.27,604.67,62.07,7.54" target="#b40">McAllister, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,415.56,604.67,91.94,7.54;1,41.22,615.15,20.97,7.54" target="#b60">Wang, Tomlinson, &amp; Noe, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,64.29,615.15,95.12,7.54" target="#b61">Yang &amp; Mossholder, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,161.51,615.15,117.22,7.54" target="#b62">Yang, Mossholder, &amp; Peng, 2009)</ref>. Affective trust refers to the trust which is based on emotional ties between two parties in a relationship that results from the mutual exhibition of care and concern <ref type="bibr" coords="1,425.98,625.59,81.53,7.54" target="#b15">(Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,209.76,33.69,105.27,6.03">The Leadership Quarterly 24 (2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="1,317.03,33.69,21.88,6.03;2,36.85,54.92,60.18,7.54">94-105 McAllister, 1995)</ref>. It is generally agreed that affective trust is a good proxy for the process of social exchange, given it measures the extent to which both parties in a relationship engage in the reciprocated exchange of care and concern <ref type="bibr" coords="2,422.29,65.35,80.85,7.54" target="#b15">(Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,36.85,75.84,91.15,7.54" target="#b53">Schaubroeck et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,130.33,75.84,61.87,7.54" target="#b62">Yang et al., 2009)</ref>. Cognitive trust, on the other hand, refers to that which is based on an instrumental evaluation by the follower of the salient personal characteristics of the leader such as their integrity, competence, reliability and dependability <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.35,96.76,79.93,7.54" target="#b15">(Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.72,96.76,90.00,7.54" target="#b53">Schaubroeck et al., 2011)</ref>. In other words, cognitive trust influences employee attitudes by making them feel more confident in their supervisor's ability and qualification to guide their task performance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,442.87,107.24,60.25,7.54;2,36.85,117.68,65.62,7.54" target="#b38">(Mayer, Davis, &amp; Schoorman, 1995)</ref>. This should lead employees to judge their work experiences in a favorable light, and encourage them to engage in behavior that benefits the organization.</p><p>However, there is also preliminary evidence to suggest that unlike affective trust, cognitive trust may also lead to overdependence or reliance of the follower on the leader and result in the tendency of followers to engage in free-riding or social loafing behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="2,98.13,159.51,65.30,7.54" target="#b26">(Kark et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,165.71,159.51,62.21,7.54" target="#b43">Ng &amp; Chua, 2006)</ref>. This suggests that whereas affective trust might positively influence work outcomes such as job performance in a positive way, cognitive trust may have negative outcomes, given that job performance requires employees to act on their own initiative and not rely on their supervisor's ability. As previous studies examining the mediating effects of trust on the relationship between transformational leadership and follower outcomes at the individual level have typically used measures of trust which combine affective and cognitive dimensions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,360.67,201.35,77.79,7.54" target="#b25">(Jung &amp; Avolio, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,440.67,201.35,62.47,7.54" target="#b47">Pillai et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,36.85,211.84,80.61,7.54" target="#b48">Podsakoff et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,119.90,211.84,125.89,7.54" target="#b52">Rubin, Bommer, &amp; Bachrach, 2010)</ref>, we believe that, due to the fact that these two types of trust are of a different nature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,96.89,222.27,64.38,7.54" target="#b40">(McAllister, 1995)</ref>, they could have very different effects on the dynamic relationships between leadership and follower outcomes. The combination of two rather different types of trust into one general construct by previous researchers means we are unable to fully understand the dynamic and complex roles played by different types of trust on follower responses to leadership behavior.</p><p>Although recent work by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,141.34,264.11,92.74,7.54" target="#b53">Schaubroeck et al. (2011)</ref> has found that cognitive and affective trust at the group level mediate the impact of transformational leadership on team performance, no attempt has been made to examine the underlying individual level psychological processes which link transformational leadership to follower work outcomes. In the present study we examine the differential effects of cognitive and affective trust at the individual level on the relationship between transformational leadership and follower work outcomes. In addition to examining how both dimensions of trust link transformational leadership to job performance, we also seek to understand how they mediate the impact of transformational leadership on the organizational commitment and OCBs of followers which measure their work attitudes and extra-role behavior. We believe it is appropriate to examine the mediating effects of affective and cognitive trust at the individual level as they were originally conceptualized as individual level constructs and because growing research has shown leadership to have differential effects at the individual and group levels <ref type="bibr" coords="2,382.95,347.79,120.20,7.54;2,36.85,358.28,20.33,7.54" target="#b14">(Dansereau, Yammarino, &amp; Kohles, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,60.12,358.28,110.74,7.54" target="#b57">Waldman &amp; Yammarino, 1999)</ref>. In addition, we feel that examining the impact of trust on follower work outcomes at the individual level is appropriate given the sample we used in the present study was taken from an industrial context in which team size is relatively large and performance is typically measured at the individual rather than the group level.</p><p>This study makes a further contribution by examining the possible negative effects of transformational leadership on subordinate work outcomes through the development of high levels of cognitive trust. Although previous studies investigating the processes by which transformational leadership weaves its effects on subordinate work outcomes through trust-based mechanisms these studies have typically adopted constructs which measure affective trust or combine items which measure affective and cognitive trust <ref type="bibr" coords="2,483.70,421.03,19.40,7.54;2,36.85,431.47,53.98,7.54" target="#b25">(Jung &amp; Avolio, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,92.58,431.47,60.01,7.54" target="#b47">Pillai et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,154.31,431.47,77.14,7.54" target="#b48">Podsakoff et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.12,431.47,62.23,7.54" target="#b52">Rubin et al., 2010)</ref>. More specifically, in light of previous work, we argue that although both affective and cognitive trust may mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and the follower work outcomes of affective organizational commitment and OCBs in a positive way, the development of high levels of cognitive trust by transformational leaders may lead followers to over-depend on their leader and increase their propensity to engage in free-riding or social loafing behavior, or to reduce personal work initiative and motivation, and negatively impact on their performance. We argue this phenomenon of over-dependence is more likely to operate at the individual level and so therefore is not evident in previous work looking at team level measures of trust and performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.61,494.28,85.75,7.54" target="#b53">Schaubroeck et al., 2011)</ref>. The findings of this study should enable us to better understand and advise managers as to how they might better leverage the effects of transformational leadership to promote desired work outcomes through the development of trust.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Transformational leadership</head><p>Out of a large number of theories of leadership, transformational leadership has been the most widely researched over the last three decades. This theory was developed and popularized by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,272.58,588.39,41.87,7.54">Bass (1985)</ref>, based on the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.75,588.39,46.96,7.54">Burns (1978)</ref>. He conceptualizes transformational leadership as having four separate dimensions, namely idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation and individualized consideration <ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.75,609.31,44.94,7.54">(Bass, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,299.23,609.31,75.26,7.54">Bass &amp; Avolio, 1994)</ref>. Transformational leaders provide idealized influence when they act as role models, exhibiting the kind of behavior that is widely admired in society. This generally includes exemplary ethical behavior, the implicit adoption of personal goals that are not self-centered, and a willingness and ability to pursue these goals even though doing so may incur personal cost and self-sacrifice. Such behavior generates respect for, and trust in, the leader and makes followers more proud of their organization and keener to work harder to promote its goals <ref type="bibr" coords="2,449.28,651.15,53.82,7.54;2,36.85,661.64,19.31,7.54">(Bass &amp; Avolio, 1994)</ref>. Intellectual stimulation refers to the degree to which leaders stimulate and encourage creativity in their followers by nurturing and developing independent and innovative thought <ref type="bibr" coords="2,230.85,672.07,76.28,7.54">(Bass &amp; Avolio, 1994)</ref>. Transformational leaders encourage followers to ask questions, think deeply about their jobs, and figure out better ways of executing their prescribed tasks. For such leaders, learning is perceived to be valuable, problems are seen as opportunities to learn, and all employees are viewed as sources of solutions and new ideas. Inspirational motivation refers to the degree to which leaders are able to provide followers with a sense of purpose in their job that will generate additional, goal-directed energy for the organization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,290.15,75.84,41.53,7.54">(Bass, 1985)</ref>. They do this by creating a new vision, mobilizing commitment to that vision, setting clear and plausible strategies for attaining the vision, communicating these clearly and precisely to followers, and generating optimism amongst followers that, with realistic effort, the goals can be achieved and the vision attained <ref type="bibr" coords="3,41.22,107.24,48.85,7.54" target="#b0">(Avolio, 1999)</ref>. Individualized consideration describes the extent to which leaders instill in followers an appreciation that the leaders genuinely care for them and their well-being <ref type="bibr" coords="3,199.90,117.68,79.69,7.54" target="#b23">(Judge &amp; Piccolo, 2004)</ref>. Leaders do this by such actions as keeping communication lines open, mentoring individual followers when appropriate, listening attentively to their concerns and needs and pro-actively taking steps to address these <ref type="bibr" coords="3,121.49,138.59,50.55,7.54" target="#b0">(Avolio, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.05,138.59,38.53,7.54" target="#b4">Bass, 1998)</ref>.</p></div>

The extent to which followers are prepared to subject themselves to the actions of the leader depends on how they are treated by their leader.

The exhibition of exemplary behavior and a willingness to put group goals over personal benefits by the leader should serve to strengthen the emotional bond between the leader and follower, resulting in higher levels of affective trust. In addition, a leader that demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice individual benefits for group goals, and maintains consistency between their spoken words and deeds, should enhance follower perceptions of their integrity and reliability, and engender higher levels of cognitive trust <ref type="bibr" coords="4,267.48,190.92,95.05,7.54" target="#b28">Kirkpatrick &amp; Locke, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, a transformational leader, who displays intellectual stimulation, should engender higher levels of trust in their followers. By stimulating and encouraging creativity, the leader empowers their followers to get involved in the process of decision making, and enables them to influence decisions which may impact them. This provides a signal to the follower that the leader respects them and is prepared to enter into a social exchange . This should in turn strengthen the emotional bond between the two parties and lead to higher levels of affective trust. Such behavior is also likely to engender cognitive trust as it should enhance follower perceptions as to the competence, integrity and dependability of their leader.</p><p>The display of inspirational motivation by a transformational leader through the creation of a common vision that group members can identify with, and ensuring attainment of that vision, should heighten the trust of the followers <ref type="bibr" coords="4,448.20,274.60,51.00,7.54" target="#b0">(Avolio, 1999)</ref>.

As affective trust results from the follower's attribution that the leader genuinely cares about them and acts with their interests in mind, transformational leaders who exhibit concern for the welfare, needs and job security of followers will serve to strengthen the emotional bond with their followers, and induce higher levels of affective trust <ref type="bibr" coords="4,343.15,389.63,79.94,7.54" target="#b15">(Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,425.59,389.63,73.61,7.54" target="#b25">Jung &amp; Avolio, 2000)</ref>.

As highlighted in the previous section, transformational leaders who provide idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation and individualized consideration should lead subordinates to have greater confidence in the ability of the leader to guide and enable their task efforts (i.e. engender higher levels of cognitive trust). When followers have high levels of cognitive trust in the leader, they will be more likely to judge their work experiences in a favorable light, and exhibit higher levels of commitment to the organization accordingly.

Although over-dependency should not engender lower commitment and reduce the willingness of the follower to engage in OCBs, it may have an adverse effect on followers' job performance, especially when there is potential for individuals to engage in free-riding behavior. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,397.14,511.69,69.73,7.54">Kark et al.'s (2003)</ref> found that followers' overreliance over transformational leadership might engender followers' overestimating the competence of their leader, which in turn negatively impacts on their job performance. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,283.64,532.61,73.41,7.54" target="#b43">Ng and Chua (2006)</ref> also suggest high levels of cognitive trust may also lead to a belief amongst followers that the leader will not react too negatively if they reduce their work performance. This may lead to slacking on the part of the opportunistic followers (a social loafing effect), and result in lower levels of employee performance consequentially. This is likely to be more so the case for larger teams, where the leader finds it relatively difficult to observe the work of their followers on a regular basis.

The firm is located in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, which is in the south-east of China. It is one of the largest brand garment manufacturers in China and is involved in the design, production and marketing of women's garments. It has over 1200 retail shops in China and has three independent brands. Its manufacturing operations employ around 2500 people and its annual revenue reached over 600 million Chinese Renminbi (around 94 million U.S. dollars) in 2010.</p><p>The respondents belonged to 17 production workgroups involved in the production of garments. Each group comprised of 1 supervisor and between 12 and 28 subordinates. The production workgroup was responsible for one production line. A great deal of coordination was required between team members as they worked sequentially on the line, each specializing in a specific task. The supervisor was tasked with monitoring their work process, guiding them to enhance their work perform and motivating them to work more efficiently. The employees in this firm are typically migrant workers from poorer provinces in the country.</p><p>Data was collected during October 2010. All respondents were employed in full-time positions, and teams in which the research was to be conducted were randomly selected from lists obtained from the firm's HR department. Both supervisor and subordinate questionnaires were used in the study. Prior to their distribution the survey instruments were translated into Chinese from English by bilingual members of the research team using the back-translation procedure <ref type="bibr" coords="6,378.07,170.00,50.22,7.54" target="#b8">(Brislin, 1993)</ref>. The questionnaires were then piloted on 10 supervisor-subordinate dyads from the firm. These dyads did not form part of the main sample. On the basis of feedback from the pilot study, the Chinese translation and order of some questions were changed to make the translation more precise and enhance the understanding and flow of the survey.</p><p>The questionnaires for subordinates and supervisors were administered separately. Questionnaires were distributed to all subordinates under the management of each supervisor, but their participation was made voluntary. The questionnaire for subordinates was administered in three waves. Subordinates provided their personal demographic data and ranked the transformational leadership behavior of their immediate supervisor in the first wave. In the second wave subordinates ranked their cognitive and affective trust in supervisor. Finally, they provided their ratings of affective organizational commitment in the third and final wave. Supervisor data were collected in the third week in one wave. Supervisors were required to report the OCBs and job performance of their subordinates.</p><p>Before distribution to subordinate and supervisor groups, participants were informed of the purposes of the research and promised anonymity. Both sets of questionnaires were coded to ensure that the responses of the subordinates and their direct supervisors could be matched. In total, 636 fully completed dyadic responses were returned, out of a total of 1000 distributed, indicating a response rate of 63.6%. These accounted for 318 supervisor/subordinate dyads. The sample respondents comprised 318 subordinates and 17 supervisors. Of the sampled subordinates, around 57% were female and their average tenure was just less than 11 months. Of the 17 supervisors, around 47% were female. On average they had been employed in a supervisory capacity for slightly more than 16 months.</p></div>

These include the age, gender and education level of followers, the tenure of the follower in months, the size of the team and the tenure of the leader in months. Age and education were measured as dichotomous variables. To measure age the following categories were utilized: 1 = "18-20", 2 = "21-25", 3 = "26-30", 4 = "31-35", 5 = "36-40", 6 = "41-45", 7 = "46-50", 8 = "&gt;50."

Amongst all control variables, only team size was found to be significantly related to both the cognitive trust (r = .04, p b .01), and affective trust (r = .01, p b .01) of followers. This might result from the fact that followers in a large group think that they are more powerful as a large collective entity because they have more people in their team. This may result in them perceiving leaders as being more competent and reliable (i.e., cognitive trust), and heighten their appreciation of leaders for providing a nurturing environment for maintaining such a big team (i.e., affective trust). We conducted the analysis for both the full mediation model (i.e., without the direct effect from transformational leadership to the three outcome variables) and partial mediation model (i.e., with the direct paths from transformational leadership to the three outcome variables).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The present study contributes to the literature on transformational leadership and trust by providing a more nuanced understanding as to the mediating role played by trust on the relationships between transformational leadership and follower work outcomes than previous studies which have typically conceptualized trust as a uni-dimensional construct. This is done through the adoption of a more finely-tuned two-dimensional conceptualization of trust, comprising measures of cognitive and affective trust as suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="9,156.64,410.61,86.77,7.54" target="#b15">Dirks and Ferrin (2002)</ref>. In line with our initial expectations, transformational leadership was found to lead to higher levels of both cognitive and affective trust. However, only affective trust was found to positively mediate the impact of transformational leadership on follower affective organizational commitment, OCBs, and job performance. In addition, cognitive trust negatively mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and job performance, and did not mediate the effect of transformational leadership on affective organizational commitment and OCBs. These findings suggest that it is affective trust, which is developed through the mutual exchange of concern and care between the follower and leader, and not cognitive trust, which is developed through the follower's instrumental evaluation of the leader's personal characteristics, that translates transformational leadership into positive work outcomes for the organization. These findings provide support for social  exchange based explanations as to how trust engenders positive work outcomes amongst followers, and are important given the lack of research into how affective and cognitive dimensions of trust influence the response of followers to transformational leadership <ref type="bibr" coords="10,36.85,75.84,75.44,7.54" target="#b15">(Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>We also uncover the interesting finding that cognitive trust has a different type of effect on the relationship between transformational leadership and follower job performance than affective trust. This might result from the fact that affective trust has been found to improve cooperation between the follower and the leader, whereas cognitive trust may reduce co-operation because of the free-riding tendency of the follower towards the leader <ref type="bibr" coords="10,243.89,117.68,62.40,7.54" target="#b43">(Ng &amp; Chua, 2006)</ref>, especially when the team size is relatively large. This in turn may impact negatively on employee performance. Another explanation for the findings may result from the fact that followers may tend to over-rely on transformational leaders in which they have high levels of cognitive trust. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" coords="10,462.11,138.59,41.08,7.54;10,36.85,149.08,24.88,7.54">Kark et al.'s (2003)</ref> findings that transformational leadership might engender overreliance by followers on the dependability and competence of their leader, which in turn negatively impacts on their job performance. Interestingly, the study finding regarding the role of cognitive trust as a mediator between transformational leadership and follower job performance is different from what is found by <ref type="bibr" coords="10,458.08,170.00,45.05,7.54;10,36.85,180.43,43.28,7.54" target="#b53">Schaubroeck et al. (2011)</ref> that both dimensions of trust mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and servant leadership and team work outcomes positively.

Nevertheless, we suggest more studies should be conducted in the future to further and better understand the complex and dynamic roles of cognitive trust across different levels on leadership effectiveness.</p><p>The social context in which the present research study was conducted may also help to explain the importance of affective trust as a mediator compared to cognitive trust. Since China is a relationship-oriented culture, characterized by collectivistic values and interpersonal relationalism, individuals tend to work harder to develop and maintain relationships than in more individualistic societies <ref type="bibr" coords="10,69.51,285.03,96.36,7.54" target="#b19">(Farh, Leung, &amp; Law, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,168.21,285.03,48.84,7.54" target="#b21">Hwang, 2000)</ref>. Social relationships are characterized by strong emotional underpinnings, and grow stronger as both parties engage in a process of social reciprocity <ref type="bibr" coords="10,292.08,295.52,68.18,7.54" target="#b56">(Tan &amp; Chee, 2005)</ref>. This creates a feeling of indebtedness, which results in continued interaction between individuals within the relationship and engenders higher levels of affective trust <ref type="bibr" coords="10,36.85,316.44,68.51,7.54" target="#b10">(Chang &amp; Chi, 2007)</ref>. In such a context, trust development between leaders and their followers is unlikely to be explained by cognitive factors such as competence, integrity and trustworthiness alone. Emotional factors are likely to play a more important role in the development of trust in the Chinese organizational context than in more individualistic societies. Future research is recommended to empirically test this argument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Managerial implications</head><p>Although the results of the present study establish that transformational leadership plays an important role in engendering positive work outcomes through the development of affective trust, managers should be aware that it may have a negative impact on job performance through eliciting higher levels of cognitive trust. Organizations should not simply seek to promote transformational leadership behavior without seeking to understand how it may impact on the development of affective and cognitive trust. Managers, especially those who tend to be more task-oriented, should be aware of the potential downside that might exist through developing high levels of cognitive trust. In addition, in order to decrease the chance of cognitive trust in negatively impacting follower job performance, leaders need to encourage their followers to accept personal responsibility and take the initiative rather than to over rely on the ability of the leader in accomplishing group tasks. At the same time, it is also beneficial for leaders to clarify each follower's job roles and set goals for each follower in the group <ref type="bibr" coords="10,391.62,473.36,83.38,7.54" target="#b35">(Locke &amp; Latham, 1990)</ref>, which is posited to positively influence follower job performance.</p><p>In order to enhance the work outcomes of their subordinates, managers should pay attention as to how their transformational leadership behavior might contribute to the formation of affective trust. They should focus their attention on developing a social exchange relationship through the cultivation of personal ties with their subordinates, which, in turn, will help develop affective trust. Strategies that might be utilized by leaders to enhance the process of social exchange might include the provision of individualized support and encouragement to subordinates, the empowerment of subordinates to take greater responsibility in decision making, and the engagement of subordinates in collaborative communication <ref type="bibr" coords="10,428.37,546.55,74.77,7.54" target="#b15">Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,36.85,557.04,78.34,7.54" target="#b25">Jung &amp; Avolio, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,118.77,557.04,93.35,7.54" target="#b53">Schaubroeck et al., 2011)</ref>. Training programs targeting the use of such strategies by managers in the workplace might be useful in eliciting follower work outcomes associated with affective trust <ref type="bibr" coords="10,380.68,567.47,61.53,7.54" target="#b62">(Yang et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>In addition, our findings provide important implications for subordinates. In order to maintain high levels of performance it is essential for subordinates to maintain a strong personal relationship (i.e. develop affective trust) with their manager. It would be helpful for them to identify the key work-related and personal interests of their manager and seek to develop shared interests with them. However, at the same time subordinates should be careful about becoming over-reliant on their manager and be pro-active in the workplace. They should be prepared to put forward their own ideas without encouragement from the supervisor in order to contribute to organizational effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Limitations and suggestions for future research</head><p>Before examining potential areas of future research it is important to highlight a number of limitations with the present study. First, its cross-sectional nature means it is difficult to ascertain the true direction of causality between the variables used in the study. For example, followers who have greater trust in their leader may rate the transformational leadership of their leader more favorably. To address this issue, future studies may adopt a longitudinal study design, which, at the same time, can help examine the incremental developmental processes of follower trust in leaders.</p><p>Second, the sample used in this study was drawn from a single organization in the Chinese manufacturing industry. Future work should be conducted in a larger number of organizational and industrial contexts to determine the generalizability of the findings from the present study. Cross-cultural studies may also be conducted to throw light on the extent to which the impact of trust on follower responses to transformational leaders is culturally bound, in particular to the differences between affective and cognitive trust. It is of particular interest to examine whether our findings are replicable in more individualistic cultures in which interpersonal relationships are less important to organizational effectiveness.</p><p>Thirdly, multi-level analysis might be used in future work in order to aggregate follower evaluations of transformational leadership behavior up to the team level. The relatively large numbers of subordinates per supervisor and small number of supervisors in our sample prevented us from doing this. Therefore, it is recommended that future studies will benefit from collecting data from a larger and more diverse sample, in terms of age, education and work experience. Future research might also investigate possible factors that might moderate the mediating effect of affective trust on the relationship between transformational leadership and follower work outcomes. These factors might include the length of time of leader and follower has worked together, follower personality, regulatory focus and individually-held cultural values <ref type="bibr" coords="11,464.30,211.84,43.19,7.54;11,41.22,222.27,19.59,7.54" target="#b43">(Ng &amp; Chua, 2006)</ref>. This will enable researchers to seek the answer to whom, and under what type of contexts or environments, cognitive and affective trust will mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and follower work outcomes. In future studies researchers might also consider how affective and cognitive trust might mediate the impact of other leadership styles on follower work outcomes. It might be of particular interest, to investigate how trust might play a role in mediating the impact of more transactional styles of leadership on performance outcomes in an industrial setting such as the manufacturing industry, where performance-related reward systems are in widespread use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Research into transformational leadership has grown in volume over the past three decades. Despite this, researchers have only started to pay attention to the mechanisms through which transformational leadership translates into follower work outcomes of benefit to organizations. The present study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of trust, especially affective trust, in explaining why transformational leaders are able to get their followers to exhibit greater commitment, work harder for their employers and engage in more fruitful organizational citizenship behaviors. It also makes a significant contribution to the previous body of literature by highlighting the fact that transformational leaders who engender high levels of cognitive trust may have a negative impact on the work performance of their followers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="9,133.68,683.74,281.25,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The mediating role of affective and cognitive trust on transformational leadership effects.</figDesc></figure>
