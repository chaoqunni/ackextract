<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>Despite concern about environmental issues, many people engage in environmentally-unfriendly behavior. The present research introduces a novel predictor of environmentally friendly behavior: attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist, or the favorability of a mental image someone has of the typical, representative environmentalist. Based on previous findings linking prototype attitudes to behavior, we expected positive attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes to predict greater environmentally friendly behavior. In addition, the current studies used not just explicit, direct self-reports of attitudes, but also indirect measures of implicit attitudes, which are less intentional, less controllable, and less deliberate. As expected, Studies 1 and 2 showed that positive implicit and explicit attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist predict self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors. In Study 2, positive implicit and explicit prototype attitudes also predicted greater likelihood of donating to an environmental charity. These findings provide the first demonstration of the utility of prototype models in environmentalism.</p></div>

For example, when one thinks of the category "pets" it is likely that a dog or a cat comes to mind, rather than an orangutan or a flying squirrel, even though the latter two could fit into the category. Consistently, when asked "do you like pets?" a person's response is likely to be the same as if they were asked "do you like cats and dogs?" because cats and dogs represent prototypical members of the category <ref type="bibr" coords="2,167.81,108.61,48.08,7.54" target="#b51">(Rosch, 1973)</ref>.</p><p>People also have prototypes of social categories (e.g., professors, bank tellers, smokers). This is a mental image of the representative person whom they think of when think of the category. Social prototypes can differ widely; one person's prototypical smoker may be fun and cool, and another person's may be boring and uncool <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,171.24,188.42,7.97" target="#b23">(Gerrard, Gibbons, Stock, Lune, &amp; Cleveland, 2005)</ref>.

For example, in one study of teenagers, positive prototypes of smokers (e.g., as cool, fun) predicted teens' willingness to smoke cigarettes and, subsequently, their actual smoking behavior . Researchers have observed a similar influence of prototypes on behaviors ranging from alcohol use <ref type="bibr" coords="2,141.67,265.35,151.97,7.97;2,42.52,275.96,21.22,7.54" target="#b54">(Spijkerman, Larsen, Gibbons, &amp; Engels, 2010)</ref> to exercise <ref type="bibr" coords="2,115.65,275.84,177.94,7.97;2,42.52,286.45,53.66,7.54" target="#b42">(Ouellette, Hessling, Gibbons, Reis-Bergen, &amp; Gerrard, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The present studies use the Prototype-Willingness Model (PWM) to understand how attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist relate to environmental behavior. We expect that positive attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist will be associated with greater self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors (Studies 1 and 2) and greater likelihood of donating money to an environmental charity (compared to other charities; Study 2). The PWM has largely been used to measure health behaviors. Thus, one important contribution of the present work is to extend its applicability to environmental behavior.</p><p>There is a small, but important, distinction between stereotypes, which are beliefs about the nature of all members of a group <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,422.28,137.54,7.97" target="#b29">(Hamilton, Dugan, &amp; Trolier, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,184.48,422.28,109.08,7.97" target="#b30">Hilton &amp; von Hippel, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,432.76,96.77,7.97" target="#b55">Stangor &amp; Schaller, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,142.47,432.76,151.10,7.97" target="#b57">van Knippenberg &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2000)</ref> and prototypes, which are beliefs about the typical member who represents a group <ref type="bibr" coords="2,193.10,453.80,44.34,7.54" target="#b51">Rosch, 1973)</ref>. Nevertheless, the stereotyping literature supports the general idea that attitudes toward, and beliefs about, the prototypical environmentalist will influence behavior. Most related to the present work, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,268.56,485.15,25.03,7.54;2,42.52,495.64,184.07,7.54" target="#b4">Bashir, Lockwood, Chasteen, Nadolny, and Noyes (2013)</ref> found that negative stereotypes of environmental activists lead people to avoid affiliating with them. Subsequently, these participants were also less motivated to adopt pro-environmental behaviors when such behaviors were advocated by "a typical environmentalist". The present work builds on this initial finding in two important ways. First, we measure participants' actual behavior rather than intended or hypothetical behavior. Second, we include implicit measures of attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes, a point we turn to next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Implicit and explicit measures of prototypes</head><p>The current research investigates the predictive power of both implicit and explicit measures of attitudes toward prototypes. We define explicit measures of attitudes as those where participants' responses are largely intentional, controllable, and subject to deliberate introspection. Implicit measures of attitudes, on the other hand, are those where participants' responses are largely unintentional, uncontrollable, or outside of conscious awareness <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,704.72,115.75,7.97" target="#b12">(De Houwer &amp; Moors, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.93,704.72,126.81,7.97" target="#b21">Gawronski &amp; De Houwer, 2013)</ref>. Because implicit measures of attitudes typically do not alert the respondent to what is being measured, or do not allow the respondent time to control their automatic response, they are ideal for detecting attitudes that people are otherwise unwilling or unable to report <ref type="bibr" coords="2,368.56,77.07,104.26,7.97" target="#b25">(Greenwald &amp; Banaji, 1995)</ref>. For simplicity, in this manuscript we will refer to the outcomes of explicit measures as "explicit attitudes" and the outcomes of implicit measures as "implicit attitudes" (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,388.46,108.60,62.69,7.54" target="#b11">De Houwer, 2006</ref>, for further discussion of this distinction). It is important to note that both implicit and explicit attitudes often inform behavior (see below), and neither is a definite reflection of a "truer" or "real" attitude.</p><p>Researchers rarely use implicit measures when assessing prototypes or environmental attitudes, and have never measured implicit attitudes of environmentalist prototypes. Measuring attitudes toward implicit prototypes should expand explanatory power beyond more traditional explicit measures. Evidence suggests that implicit and explicit attitudes have distinct predictive validity (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.53,213.08,193.96,7.97" target="#b27">Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, &amp; Banaji, 2009</ref>; for a metaanalysis).

First, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.34,338.72,69.23,7.54;2,311.53,349.21,24.20,7.54" target="#b48">Ratliff and Howell (2015)</ref> demonstrated that implicit attitudes toward the prototypical woman with tan skin predicted more variance in women's reported sun behavior, planned sun behavior, willingness to engage and risky sun behavior, and tanning frequency than did explicit attitudes toward prototypes (see also . Then, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.53,401.48,157.31,7.54" target="#b49">Redford, Howell, Meijs, and Ratliff (2016)</ref> found that implicit attitudes toward the prototypical feminist explained variance in feminist behavior (public identification, donating to a feminist organization) above and beyond explicit attitudes alone (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.53,443.20,142.05,7.97" target="#b59">Weis, Zucker, Redford, &amp; Ratliff, 2017)</ref>. Both of these findings suggest that measuring implicit prototype-attitudes can maximize prediction of real-world behavior.</p><p>While there has been relatively little study of the role of implicit attitudes in environmental behavior, and none specifically regarding implicit prototypes, the work that does exist suggests the utility of implicit attitude measures in predicting environmentally friendly behavior. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,474.69,516.56,87.85,7.54;2,311.53,527.00,71.88,7.54">Panzone, Hilston, Sale, and Cohen (2016)</ref> found that explicit attitudes (a measure of environmental concern) predicted overall sustainable food shopping behavior, but decisions in single categories (e.g., bottled water) were better predicted by more specific implicit attitudes. More generally, the research suggests that implicit attitude measures are particularly useful in situations where selfpresentation concerns might contribute to self-report <ref type="bibr" coords="2,534.44,589.75,28.12,7.54;2,311.53,600.24,20.11,7.54" target="#b40">(Nosek, 2005)</ref>.

For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.68,631.59,134.69,7.54" target="#b52">Siegrist, Keller, and Cousin (2006)</ref> showed that while people did not self-report negative attitudes towards nuclear energy, measures of implicit attitudes suggested that they were opposed to nuclear energy. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.64,663.00,95.89,7.54" target="#b6">Beattie and Sale (2009)</ref> found that most participants' self-reported attitudes toward low carbon-footprint products were more favorable than their implicit attitudes.</p><p>Similarly, we suspect that people might be unwilling to report or unable to access unfavorable attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist.

Project Implicit is a website researchers designed to conduct research and to promote education in the social and behavioral sciences. Participants typically find the site through suggestion of friends, school or work assignment, or through links in news sources. Participants complete demographic information upon registration, and are then randomly assigned to a study from a pool of studies.</p><p>Once they were assigned to this study, participants were again randomly assigned to respond to one of five prototype conditions, which we treat separately for data analysis. In other words, each participant completed measures of only one potential characteristic of the prototypical environmentalist: attractiveness (final N ¼ 243), coolness (final N ¼ 260), fun (final N ¼ 243), intelligence (final N ¼ 228), or judgmentalness (final N ¼ 216). We chose the first four traits based on previous work utilizing the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM; e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,104.72,505.96,85.31,7.97" target="#b48">Ratliff &amp; Howell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.25,506.08,75.30,7.54" target="#b49">Redford et al., 2016)</ref> and the latter, judgmental, because it is a common stereotype of environmentalists <ref type="bibr" coords="3,88.38,527.00,73.63,7.54" target="#b4">(Bashir et al., 2013)</ref>.

Participants responded to the target word ("Environmentalists") in 8e10 trials out of 60 total trials. They also responded to eight distractor stimuli: bicyclists, politicians, Republicans, Democrats, vegetarians, lobbyists, feminists, and professors. See Appendix A for screen shot of the measure. The instructions given to participants prior to the task were as follows:</p><p>In this next part of the study you will judge words or pictures very quickly. First, you will see "XXXXXXXX" in the middle of the screen. Then there will be picture or word. You will indicate how you feel about the picture or word using the 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys on your keyboard, as shown. You simply press the key that corresponds to how you feel about that item. As soon as you respond to one item, the next will appear. You will have one ONE SECOND to respond to each item, so just go with your gut reaction and don't be worried if you hit the wrong key from time to time. If it takes you longer than one second to respond, a prompt will indicate that you need to go faster and then the next item will appear. Remember this task goes very fast so stay alert.

It was considered an error if participants did not respond to the stimulus item within the response window. Of the remaining 1222 participants, the overall error rate was 21.1% (SD ¼ 16.7), and the error rate on the target trials was 17.3% (SD ¼ 24.0). We then discarded data from 32 participants whose error rates were more than two standard deviations from the mean error rate on target trials, resulting in a total of 1190 participants.</p><p>Self-Reported Environmentalist Prototype.

It is possible that participants with positive implicit prototypes of environmentalists are simply more likely to report that they engage in environmental behavior.

Participants were then asked to generate a mental image of a single person representing the prototypical environmentalist. Participants completed the implicit prototype measures and the measure of their self-reported behavior in a counterbalanced order. To disguise the true nature of the study, participants also completed a variety of items about topics like feminism, philanthropy, and volunteering (related to the filler items in the speeded report task). After participants completed the study, the researcher escorted them to a table with four jars on it, each labeled for a charity and full of $20 in quarters (about ¼ of the jar). In front of the jars were one-page print-outs about each of the charities and their goals.</p><p>The researcher told participants that an anonymous donor was going to donate money to each of the charities at the end of the study, and that participants got to decide where the money would go. The researcher also indicated that all charities received highly positive reviews on http://www.charitynavigator.org.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">General discussion</head><p>In two studies, implicit and explicit attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes predicted two types of relevant outcomes: (1) self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors (Studies 1 and 2), (2) the amount participants donated to an environmental charity (Study 2). These findings provide the first demonstration of the utility of prototype models in understanding environmental behavior. They also advance an emerging literature on how attitudes toward implicit prototypes predict behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="6,311.53,286.33,91.49,7.97" target="#b48">Ratliff &amp; Howell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,407.34,286.45,79.58,7.54" target="#b49">Redford et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus far, implicit prototypes have been shown to predict only UV behavior (e.g., tanning; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,349.91,307.25,97.98,7.97" target="#b48">Ratliff &amp; Howell, 2015)</ref> and feminist identification <ref type="bibr" coords="6,311.53,317.80,81.06,7.54" target="#b49">(Redford et al., 2016)</ref>. As the first to link implicit prototypes to environmental behavior, the present work suggests the generality of implicit prototypes in predicting behavior and offers further evidence for the utility of measuring implicit prototypes.</p><p>The present work also suggests several possible future lines of inquiry. First, future research should investigate whether attitudes toward prototypes moderate typical predictors of environmental behavior. Prototypes may increase or decrease the effects of more structural or contextual predictors of environmental behavior. For instance, research suggests that people are more likely to engage in environmentally friendly behaviors to the extent that they feel the behaviors are easy to implement (e.g <ref type="bibr" coords="6,458.14,432.88,41.48,7.54" target="#b19">Fujii, 2006)</ref>. If attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes are negative, even those who report that they want to engage in environmentally friendly behaviors (e.g., recycling) may acquiesce to difficult circumstances. By contrast, if attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes are very positive, a person may recycle even if it is difficult, shielding them from the negative effects of difficulty.</p><p>Future research should also determine the conditions under which implicit and explicit attitudes each predict environmentally friendly behavior. For example, implicit attitudes generally outperform explicit attitudes in predicting socially sensitive behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="6,341.86,547.91,90.07,7.54" target="#b27">(Greenwald et al., 2009)</ref>. So, to the extent that people are motivated to report favorable attitudes toward environmentalists, implicit measures should predict behavior more strongly than explicit attitudes. Implicit and explicit attitudes may also predict different aspects of behavior. Implicit attitudes tend to be better predictors of nonverbal, spontaneous behavior (e.g., friendliness; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,311.53,610.67,74.51,7.54" target="#b15">Dovidio et al., 2002)</ref> than explicit attitudes, which perform better at predicting controllable behaviors (e.g., brand-related choices and voting, <ref type="bibr" coords="6,341.86,631.47,165.48,7.97" target="#b8">Brunel, Collins, Tietje, &amp; Greenwald, 1999</ref>; for a metaanalysis, see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,362.49,642.08,89.33,7.54" target="#b27">Greenwald et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, it might be that implicit and explicit a toward prototypes have different effects on environmentally friendly behaviors that differ in automaticity or controllability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Research limitations</head><p>Although the present study suggests unique predictive power of implicit prototypes in behavior, it remains to be seen whether the present effects would generalize in the context of other predictors.</p><p>In addition to prototypes and behaviors, the full Prototype-Willingness Model (PWM) includes attitudes and subjective norms as predictors of intentions, willingness, and behaviors. Given that our focus here was on the contribution of prototypes to environmental behavior, with a specific focus on including implicit and explicit prototypes, we did not examine the full PWM. Moreover, evidence consistently suggests that prototypes predict in addition to, and often more than, attitudes and subjective norms <ref type="bibr" coords="7,251.71,139.96,32.13,7.54;7,32.83,150.44,52.43,7.54" target="#b22">(Gerrard et al., 2008)</ref>. Nevertheless, future studies should examine whether prototypes (both implicit and explicit) continue to predict behavior in the context of other measures (e.g., attitudes, subjective norms).</p><p>Anotherlimitation of the present work is that it was primarily correlational in nature. Despite the clear relationship between environmentalist prototypes and behavior, it is impossible to infer that prototypes cause behavior. Indeed, positive prototypes of environmentalists might cause people to engage in more environmentally friendly behaviors. This pattern is supported best by other work on the PWM, which implicates prototypes as causing behavior. Nevertheless, in the present study we cannot rule out the possibility that engaging in environmentally friendly behavior promotes pro-environmentalist attitudes. Our second study offers at least some temporal precedent of measured environmentalist prototype attitudes in predicting a novel environmentally friendly behavior, consistent with the PWM. Nevertheless, because we cannot conclude causality, future studies should directly test the causal influence of prototype attitudes on environmentally friendly behavior.</p><p>Such causal evidence could come from studies using prototypebased interventions to increase environmentally friendly behavior. The relationship between positive prototype attitudes and positive behaviors suggests that interventionists wishing to increase environmentally friendly behavior should consider how to promote positive implicit attitudes toward environmentalists. Changing implicit attitudes often requires different means than changing explicit attitudes (c.f. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,121.95,432.76,141.15,7.97" target="#b53">Smith, De Houwer, &amp; Nosek, 2013)</ref>. For example, implicit attitudes change particularly well in response to associative retraining (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="7,145.76,453.68,138.09,7.97" target="#b1">Baccus, Baldwin, &amp; Packer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,32.82,464.23,72.25,7.54" target="#b14">Dijksterhuis, 2004)</ref>. In the context of environmental behavior, associative retraining might consist of repeatedly pairing pictures of environmentalists with positive stimuli. Doing so should lead to more positive implicit attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes and, subsequently, more environmentally friendly behavior.</p><p>One final limitation of the present results was that the order of presentation of implicit and explicit attitudes was fixed. We chose to present explicit attitudes first followed by implicit attitudes so that participants could understand the task at hand prior to having to speed it. Moreover, fixing the task order reduces error variance and makes it easier to find true relationships between variables. Nevertheless, future studies should examine whether the order of presentation of implicit and explicit attitudes influences the extent to which they relate to environmental behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>At the outset of this inquiry, we noted that despite the fact that most people are concerned about environmental issues <ref type="bibr" coords="7,255.73,663.00,28.15,7.54;7,32.82,673.49,45.91,7.54" target="#b61">(Yeager et al., 2011)</ref>, many do not engage in environmentally friendly behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="7,70.24,683.80,94.93,7.97" target="#b35">(Knussen &amp; Yule, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,169.62,683.92,92.11,7.54" target="#b45">Rabinovich et al., 2010)</ref>. The present work offers a novel way of understanding environmentally unfriendly behavior. Specifically, it suggests that positive attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist relate positively to environmentally friendly behaviors. Importantly, it implicates both implicit and explicit processes in predicting this behavior, suggesting that environmentally friendly behavior may derive both from controlled, thoughtful processes, but also from automatic, affective reactions to the types of people who actively engage in environmentally friendly behavior. The present studies represent the first attempt to unite inquires about environmentalism with knowledge about prototypes and prototype models and implicit social cognition. In so doing, it plants the seed for several potential future studies and offers potential targets for future interventions to predict and promote behavior that is crucial to the health of the planet.</p><p>Author's note This research was supported by Project Implicit.
