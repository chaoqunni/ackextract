<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>When students learn scientific theories that conflict with their earlier, naïve theories, what happens to the earlier theories? Are they overwritten or merely suppressed? We investigated this question by devising and implementing a novel speeded-reasoning task. Adults with many years of science education verified two types of statements as quickly as possible: statements whose truth value was the same across both naïve and scientific theories of a particular phenomenon (e.g., ''The moon revolves around the Earth'') and statements involving the same conceptual relations but whose truth value differed across those theories (e.g., ''The Earth revolves around the sun''). Participants verified the latter significantly more slowly and less accurately than the former across 10 domains of knowledge (astronomy, evolution, fractions, genetics, germs, matter, mechanics, physiology, thermodynamics, and waves), suggesting that naïve theories survive the acquisition of a mutually incompatible scientific theory, coexisting with that theory for many years to follow.</p></div>

Psychologists who have studied this process -typically termed ''conceptual change'' -have characterized the transition from naïve theories to scientific theories in several ways. Some have emphasized the role of category knowledge, characterizing conceptual change as a series of conceptual differentiations, in which new category boundaries are established, and conceptual coalescences, in which old category boundaries are collapsed <ref type="bibr" coords="1,355.12,558.40,50.66,7.53" target="#b3">(Carey, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,408.47,558.40,46.72,7.53" target="#b31">Smith, 2007)</ref>. Some have emphasized the role of ontological hierarchies, characterizing conceptual change as the reassignment of a key concept, or system of concepts, from one branch of an ontological hierarchy to another <ref type="bibr" coords="1,408.86,600.24,94.28,7.53;1,281.93,610.73,21.99,7.53" target="#b4">(Chi, Slotta, &amp; de Leeuw, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.08,610.73,54.68,7.53" target="#b36">Thagard, 1992)</ref>.

All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2012.04.005 to knowledge restructuring, or the conversion of one conceptual system into another by radically altering the structure (and not just the content) of that system. Implicit in the idea of knowledge restructuring is the idea that early modes of thought, once restructured, should no longer be accessible, for the basic constituents of the earlier system are no longer represented. A number of recent findings have challenged this idea, however, by showing that early modes of thought do sometimes reemerge later in life. Alzheimer's patients, for instance, have been shown to endorse teleological explanations for natural phenomena that typically only children endorse <ref type="bibr" coords="2,41.16,180.26,143.94,7.53" target="#b18">(Lombrozo, Kelemen, &amp; Zaitchik, 2007)</ref>. While adults without Alzheimer's disease do not typically endorse these explanations, they can be induced to do so under speeded conditions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,85.32,211.61,97.80,7.53" target="#b15">(Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009</ref>). Adults have also been shown to be slower and less accurate at categorizing plants as alive than at categorizing animals as alive <ref type="bibr" coords="2,41.16,243.02,131.08,7.53" target="#b11">(Goldberg &amp; Thompson-Schill, 2009</ref>), reminiscent of young children's belief that animate entities are alive but inanimate entities are not <ref type="bibr" coords="2,125.23,263.94,51.06,7.53" target="#b24">(Piaget, 1929)</ref>. Even biology professors were found to be slower and less accurate at classifying plants as alive than at classifying animals as alive, implying that years of professional experience had not erased an erroneous distinction first drawn in childhood <ref type="bibr" coords="2,62.76,316.21,132.49,7.53" target="#b11">(Goldberg &amp; Thompson-Schill, 2009</ref>).</p><p>These findings, among others <ref type="bibr" coords="2,174.89,326.70,87.40,7.53;2,41.16,337.13,45.73,7.53" target="#b8">(Dunbar, Fugelsang, &amp; Stein, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.91,337.13,92.44,7.53" target="#b16">Legare &amp; Gelman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,185.38,337.13,77.00,7.53;2,41.16,347.62,16.63,7.53" target="#b42">Zaitchik &amp; Solomon, 2008</ref>, suggest that scientific knowledge serves to mask, rather than replace, one's initial intuitions. They are consistent with the views of many science education researchers, who see the purpose of instruction as reanalyzing, rather than replacing, pre-instructional ideas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,41.16,399.89,100.67,7.53" target="#b1">Caravita &amp; Hallden, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,145.41,399.89,56.95,7.53" target="#b6">Clement, 1993)</ref>. They are also consistent with models of theory change that emphasize the inferential competition between theories rather than the replacement of one theory by another (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,230.34,431.30,32.03,7.53;2,41.16,441.73,21.81,7.53" target="#b23">Ohlsson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,67.63,441.73,190.70,7.53" target="#b35">Tenenbaum, Kemp, Griffiths, &amp; Goodman, 2011)</ref>. Nevertheless, current evidence for the persistence of early intuitions is limited to studies that tap a single conceptual distinction, like the distinction between living and nonliving things <ref type="bibr" coords="2,80.28,483.57,101.46,7.53" target="#b42">(Zaitchik &amp; Solomon, 2008)</ref> or the distinction between teleological and nonteleological processes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,226.25,494.05,36.12,7.53;2,41.16,504.49,51.59,7.53" target="#b15">(Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009</ref>). While these distinctions play a central role in folkbiology, it's unclear whether the effect extends to other concepts within the same domain or to concepts from other domains altogether. Documenting the exact scope of this phenomenon is critical to understanding its origin. While, on the one hand, the resilience of early intuitions may have implications for conceptual change as a whole, it may, on the other hand, have implications for only a particular kind of knowledge or a particular kind of learning.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that the resilience of early intuitions is, in fact, a domain-general phenomenon by introducing a new method for probing those intuitions that can be applied to potentially any concept in any domain. Specifically, we compare the speed and accuracy with which adults verify two types of statements: statements whose truth-value is known to remain constant across conceptual change (e.g., ''The moon revolves around the Earth,'' which is true on both naïve and scientific theories of astronomical phenomena) and syntactically analogous statements whose truth-value is known to reverse across that same change (e.g., ''The Earth revolves around the sun,'' which is true on a scientific theory but not a naïve theory). We hypothesized that, if naïve theories survive the acquisition of a mutually incompatible scientific theory, then statements whose truth-value reverse across conceptual change should cause greater cognitive conflict than statements whose truth-value remain constant, resulting in slower and less accurate verifications for those statements. If, on the other hand, naïve theories are generally overwritten by scientific theories, then statements whose truth-value reverse across conceptual change should cause no more conflict than statements whose truth-value remain constant, since the naïve theories should no longer be present to cause such conflict.</p></div>

Statements from the same domain (n = 20) were presented as a block (prefaced by the domain name), in order to minimize abrupt changes in content, but their ordering was randomized within that block, and the ordering of the domains was randomized as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Participants' accuracy at verifying statements whose truth value was consistent across both naïve and scientific theories (''consistent statements'') and statements whose truth value differed across those theories (''inconsistent statements'') is displayed in <ref type="figure" coords="3,391.64,640.50,23.99,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed that participants were significantly more accurate at verifying the former than the latter (F(1, 149) = 1582.49, p &lt; .001), and simple effects tests confirmed that this difference was robust <ref type="table" coords="3,36.85,54.73,22.48,6.03">Table 2</ref> Sample items involving the same conceptual relation. Consistent items were true on both the naïve theory (T1) and the scientific theory (T2) or false on both theories; inconsistent items (marked with an asterisk) were true on one theory but false on the other. The speed at which participants made their verifications is displayed in <ref type="figure" coords="4,120.98,483.63,23.59,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>. Only correct verifications are included in <ref type="figure" coords="4,88.84,494.06,24.56,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>, though the results do not change if incorrect verifications are included as well. As predicted, participants were significantly slower at verifying inconsistent statements than at verifying consistent ones, both across domains (F(1, 149) = 349.98, p &lt; .001) and withindomains (t(149) &gt; 3.0, p &lt; .01 for all within-domain comparisons). This pattern was robust across individual concepts as well; the average response latency for inconsistent statements was greater than that for consistent statements for 43 of the 50 concepts (see <ref type="table" coords="4,201.77,588.23,26.19,7.53" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>).</p><p>To determine whether the effect varied by response type (''true'' vs. ''false''), we collapsed the latency data across domains and analyzed them for effects of response type and statement type with a repeated-measures ANO-VA. Not surprisingly, participants verified true statements significantly faster than they verified false statements (M = 3698 ms vs. M = 3466 ms, F(1, 149) = 71.04, p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure" coords="4,55.27,671.90,18.17,7.53">Fig. 2</ref>), but there was no interaction between statement type and response type, indicating that participants correctly verified consistent statements faster than inconsistent ones regardless of whether those statements were true on scientific theories but false on naïve theories or true on naïve theories but false on scientific theories. Indeed, the mean difference in response latency between consistent and inconsistent statements for the false items (415 ms) was virtually the same as that for the true items (428 ms).</p><p>Lastly, we compared response latency to response accuracy. Overall, participants were more accurate for domains in which conceptual change tends to occur within the first decade of life (e.g., fractions, physiology) than for domains in which conceptual change tends to occur in the second decade of life (e.g., evolution, mechanics), if at all. Accompanying this difference in accuracy was a difference in speed: participants verified consistent statements an average of 562 ms faster than inconsistent statements in domains for which overall accuracy was 80% or greater (fractions, germs, physiology), 388 ms faster in domains for which overall accuracy was between 70% and 80% (astronomy, genetics, thermodynamics, matter), and 334 ms faster in domains for which overall accuracy was 70% or below (mechanics, evolution, waves). A contrast analysis confirmed that speed varied linearly with accuracy (F(1, 149) = 23.40, p &lt; .001), indicating that participants were slower to verify inconsistent statements in domains where they were more likely to verify those statements correctly.</p><p>This effect was observed at the level of the participant as well. Although all participants exhibited above-chance levels of accuracy (t(199) &gt; 2.5, p &lt; .05 for all comparisons to chance), individual participants ranged from 59% correct to 89% correct. <ref type="figure" coords="4,343.95,588.22,20.14,7.53">Fig. 3</ref> displays the mean response times for participants in each quartile of the accuracy distribution. Response times for the consistent statements did not vary by quartile, but response times for the inconsistent statements did (F(3, 146) = 2.69, p &lt; .05), with participants in the fourth quartile responding an average of 465 ms slower than participants in the first quartile. Indeed, the difference in response times between inconsistent and consistent statements was significantly correlated with accuracy scores in six of the 10 domains (fractions: r = .27; genetics:  18; all p's &lt; .05), suggesting that participants with greater domain expertise exhibited more cognitive conflict on the inconsistent items than did participants with less expertise. Although this finding needs to be explored further, it indicates, at the very least, that the effect was not an artifact of confusion or carelessness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>When students learn scientific theories that conflicts with earlier, naïve theories, what happens to the earlier theories? Our findings suggest that naïve theories are suppressed by scientific theories but not supplanted by them. Across 10 domains, participants were significantly slower and less accurate at verifying statements whose truthvalue reversed across a conceptual change (e.g., ''1/13 is greater than 1/30'') than at verifying structurally analogous statements whose truth-value remained constant across that change (e.g., ''12/13 is greater than 1/13''). This effect was observed not only in domains where participants were introduced to the correct, scientific concepts in late adolescence but also in domains where they were introduced to those concepts in early childhood. Indeed, the latency data suggest that participants exhibited more cognitive conflict in the latter than in the former, possibly because naïve theories in the latter domains emerge earlier and are thus more deeply entrenched.</p><p>Might the observed differences between consistent and inconsistent statements reflect something other than the ''tug'' of a previously discarded theory? One possibility is that the inconsistent statements were syntactically more difficult to process than the consistent ones, yet this possibility is unlikely given how the two types of statements were constructed. Consistent and inconsistent statements did not differ, after all, in the complexity of their linguistic form (e.g., ''[entity] has heat'') but in the objects or properties to which a particular linguistic expression was applied (e.g., ''the sun has heat'' vs. ''ice has heat''). Clearly, the inconsistent statements were more counterintuitive than the consistent statements but that difference constituted the manipulation of interest. Moreover, the sense in which the inconsistent statements were counterintuitive was not random or capricious but was rather constrained by decades of research in the relevant domains. For instance, in the domain of fractions, the relation ''is greater than'' was verified more quickly and more accurately when applied to the numbers 12/13 and 1/13 than when applied to the numbers 1/13 and 1/30. The reason for this difference presumably stems from the fact that our initial understanding of number, acquired in the context of counting, lacks the properties of divisibility and infinite density needed to represent non-integral quantities and must therefore be restructured before the concept of a denominator can be grasped <ref type="bibr" coords="5,396.05,326.69,79.53,7.53" target="#b21">(Moss &amp; Case, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,478.94,326.69,24.20,7.53;5,281.93,337.13,104.80,7.53" target="#b32">Smith, Solomon, &amp; Carey, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,393.16,337.13,109.97,7.53;5,281.93,347.61,19.85,7.53" target="#b37">Vamvakoussi &amp; Vosniadou, 2004)</ref>. While there may be something intrinsically more difficult about comparing numerators than comparing denominators, a more feasible explanation, in light of the math education literature, is that this difference is a historical byproduct of the conceptual trajectory from an understanding of whole number to that of rational number.</p><p>Another possibility is that the inconsistent statements represented information that was simply less familiar than that represented by the consistent statements, with the less familiar information proving more difficult to retrieve than the more familiar information. The problem with this explanation is that what constitutes ''familiar'' and ''unfamiliar'' should vary by when learning has occurred, yet the effect of interest was observed for all 10 domains, as well as the vast majority of concepts within those domains. While it is true that the effect was stronger in some domains (e.g., fractions, germs) than in others (e.g., mechanics, waves), this difference was actually in the opposite direction of that predicted by a familiarity account in that participants were slowest to verify inconsistent statements in the familiar domains, not the unfamiliar ones. Moreover, there were no consistent differences in how participants treated statements that were true on naive theories but false on scientific theories (i.e., positive misconceptions) and statements that were true on scientific theories but false of naive theories (i.e., negative misconceptions). These two types of misconceptions ostensibly vary in their familiarity by domain; positive misconceptions are ostensibly less familiar in early-developing domains (e.g., ''the sun is alive'') than in late-developing domains (e.g., ''the earth's distance from the sun causes the season'') owing to the amount of time that has passed since the relevant intuitions were first challenged, and negative misconceptions are ostensibly less familiar in late-developing domains (e.g., ''the earth's tilt causes the seasons'') than in early-developing domains (e.g., ''coral is alive'') owing to the amount of time that has passed since the relevant scientific information was first introduced. However, a statistical comparison of the response lag between consistent and inconsistent statements associated with positive misconceptions and that associated with negative misconceptions revealed no interaction between type of misconception (positive vs. negative) and domain (F(9, 1341) &lt; 1, ns).</p><p>Our findings are thus inconsistent with either alternative. They are, however, consistent with previous findings regarding the re-emergence of teleological thought and animistic thought under cognitive impairment <ref type="bibr" coords="6,221.61,201.18,40.79,7.53;6,41.16,211.61,46.41,7.53" target="#b18">(Lombrozo et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,90.88,211.61,102.76,7.53" target="#b42">Zaitchik &amp; Solomon, 2008)</ref> or cognitive load <ref type="bibr" coords="6,41.16,222.10,143.41,7.53" target="#b11">(Goldberg &amp; Thompson-Schill, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,188.84,222.10,73.48,7.53;6,41.16,232.53,15.88,7.53" target="#b15">Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009</ref>). And they do not merely replicate those findings; they extend them across multiple domains of knowledge -from the life sciences to the physical sciences to mathematics -and across multiple concepts within those domains. Indeed, the consistency of the effect within and across domains suggests that it is not merely the byproduct of a few particularly resilient intuitions but is rather a domain-general consequence of conceptual restructuring. Consequently, these findings present a strong challenge to standard models of conceptual change, like coalescence-and-differentiation models <ref type="bibr" coords="6,197.17,337.13,52.65,7.53" target="#b3">(Carey, 2009)</ref> or ontological-reassignment models <ref type="bibr" coords="6,168.99,347.62,60.06,7.53" target="#b4">(Chi et al., 1994)</ref>, as they demonstrate the continued influence of intuitions that should have been rendered obsolete by the kinds of radical restructuring these models entail. While such models could be amended to account for the data at hand, doing so would require a specification of how a single concept, like heat or force, could hold different meanings for the same individual across different contexts or different tasks.</p><p>One possible modification would be to stipulate that naïve theories and scientific theories take different forms of representation. Naïve theories might take a more contextual or more phenomenological representation, whereas scientific theories might take a more abstract or more propositional representation (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,157.66,483.57,54.85,7.53" target="#b7">DiSessa, 1993)</ref>. While this view seems plausible for domains in which naïve theories are constructed from firsthand sensory data (e.g., mechanics, thermodynamics), it seems less plausible for domains in which the relevant phenomena must be learned through testimony and inference (e.g., astronomy, evolution). Another possibility is that naïve theories and scientific theories occupy different levels of representation. On this view, beliefs about an entire ontology (e.g., matter) may be represented at a different level of abstraction than beliefs about a particular instance of that ontology (e.g., ice), giving rise to potentially many undetected inconsistencies (e.g., ''all matter has heat'' vs. ''ice has no heat''). Preliminary support for this view comes from studies showing that conceptual change is perhaps best facilitated by instructional approaches that emphasize the integration of knowledge across multiple levels of representation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,212.82,650.98,49.50,7.53;6,41.16,661.41,21.81,7.53" target="#b30">(Slotta &amp; Chi, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,65.82,661.41,78.52,7.53" target="#b41">Wiser &amp; Amin, 2001)</ref>. Further research, however, is needed to determine whether successful instruction ever truly eliminates early, erroneous intuitions or whether such intuitions persist regardless of the comprehensiveness or systematicity of the newly acquired theory.</p><p>Further research is also needed to determine why early intuitions conflict with scientific knowledge to different degrees in different domains. One possibility is that intuitive theories in early developing domains hold more sway over reasoning than those in later developing domains because they are more deeply entrenched. In other words, intuitive theories in domains like physiology and germs are constructed earlier than those in domains like evolution and waves and may thus have influenced the encoding and organization of domain-specific information to a greater extent. Another possibility is that the intuitive theories in early developing domains hold no more sway than those in later developing domains but the scientific theories do. On this account, participants experienced greater cognitive conflict in early developing domains not because their pre-scientific intuitions in those domains were any more potent or resilient but because their newfound scientific beliefs posed a more formidable challenge to those intuitions. This explanation would account not only for differences in average response latencies across domains but also for differences between individual participants within the same domain. After all, participants who exhibited greater expertise in a particular domain (as indexed by response accuracy) also exhibited greater cognitive conflict in that domain (as indexed by response latency).</p><p>One way to disentangle these two possibilities would be to compare performance in the present task with performance on independent measures of conceptual understanding -measures that could probe understanding in more depth and more detail (e.g., structured interviews, inferential reasoning tasks, think-aloud protocols). While the ''differential entrenchment'' account predicts that differences in performance in the present task should be unrelated to differences in the quality or consistency of one's scientific knowledge (beyond some particular threshold), the ''differential learning'' account predicts that the two measures should be strongly related. Indeed, the differential learning account makes the counterintuitive prediction that the response lag between consistent and inconsistent statements should actually increase with expertise. While the present study provides some preliminary support for this hypothesis, stronger support would come from studies that directly compared the response profiles of novices and experts or the response profiles of novices before and after instruction. Critically, the effect should be domain-specific, such that instruction in physics should affect performance on the mechanics items but not the evolution items and instruction in biology should affect performance on the evolution items but not the mechanics items. Such findings, in combination with the present findings, promise to shed additional light not only on the relation between naïve theories and scientific theories but also on the nature of conceptual representation and conceptual change more generally.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,41.16,415.07,221.17,6.03;4,41.16,423.63,221.16,6.03;4,41.16,432.19,139.95,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(A) Mean proportion of consistent and inconsistent statements correctly verified in each domain (all SE &lt; .02).
