<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Independent central banks prefer balanced budgets due to the long-run connection between deficits and inflation, and can enforce their preference through interest rate increases and denial of credit to the government. This article argues that legal central bank independence (CBI) deters fiscal deficits predominantly in countries with rule of law and impartial contract enforcement, a free press and constraints on executive power. It further suggests that CBI may not affect fiscal deficits in a counter-cyclical fashion, but instead depending on the electoral calendar and government partisanship. The article also tests the novel hypotheses using new yearly data on legal CBI for seventy-eight countries from 1970 to 2007. The results show that CBI restrains deficits only in democracies, during non-election years and under left government tenures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the 1990s countries worldwide reformed their central bank laws, removing monetary policy from government control. The newly independent central banks can change interest rates and target the exchange rate or money supply to ensure price stability or low inflation 1 without regard to incumbent approval ratings. Because central bank independence (CBI) has been designed as an institutional mechanism for keeping a check on inflation, most analyses focus on the effect of such independence on inflation and its potential trade-off with economic growth. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,81.58,358.89,3.74,5.84">2</ref> This article analyzes the effect of the independent status of the central bank on countries' budget deficits or surpluses, with a focus on the preferences of independent central banks vis-Ã -vis fiscal policy and the bank's ability and willingness to enforce such preferences. The consequence of the trend toward CBI is that governments lose an important means of influencing the economy and thus rely increasingly on their remaining policies, especially fiscal spending. Still, time and again, independent central bankers respond to governments' budget plans with public statements urging them to limit spending to available taxes and avoid deficits. For example, the European Central Bank's introductory statement to its president's monthly press conference habitually asks for euro-area fiscal restraint. Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, also pleaded with Congress in 2002 to control spending: 'The budget</p><p>The article makes important contributions to extant research. First, it provides a unifying theoretical framework linking institutional CBI to fiscal performance across political regimes and extends the empirical tests of this relationship beyond the research in developed countries. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,423.61,79.96,7.25,5.84">11</ref> Secondly, the literature already suggests ways to reform the budget process to mitigate deficit spending, including through budget transparency, centralization of fiscal decisions, budget targets or balanced budget provisions. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,158.17,115.79,7.31,5.84">12</ref> We add to this literature by showing that legal CBI (conditioned by political institutions) does not only contribute to low inflation but also deters fiscal deficits.</p><p>We proceed as follows. The next section reviews the causes of fiscal deficits. We then explain how independent central banks can pursue their fiscal policy preferences, identify the political conditions that allow a de facto influence of the central bank and derive testable hypotheses. The empirical sections describe the research design and discuss the results. The final section concludes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fiscal Deficits</head><p>Fiscal policy, including temporary deficits that result from counter-cyclical government policy, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,78.29,257.30,7.47,5.84">13</ref> can be a powerful contributor to investment in human and physical capital or risk sharing. A significant body of empirical research shows, however, that there are important benefits to sound public finance. 14 This work shows that fiscal deficits and high debt reduce economic growth, increase its volatility and increase long-term interest rates. Also, there are immediate and long-term declines of growth around episodes of default on national debt. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,412.89,305.09,7.47,5.84">15</ref> Much deficit spending defies the economic cycle and can be traced to political conditions that drive countries to accumulate excessive debt. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,244.01,329.01,7.47,5.84">16</ref> For example, the common pool resource problem generates deficits because benefits are targeted at specific groups, while revenues come from general taxation. According to this logic, more spending occurs when politicians appeal directly to voters rather than to party bosses, 17 in proportional electoral systems 18 or in democracies. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,102.78,376.81,7.47,5.84">19</ref> Partisanship is argued to be another source of spending beyond available taxes: deficits may occur under the left 20 due to constituency pressures or under conservative governments that aim to constrain the future choices of the left. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,303.59,400.73,7.47,5.84">21</ref> Deficits can also be the result of electoral cycles, 22 with some of the literature finding such cycles exclusively in new democracies or less developed countries, 23 while other research identifies circumstances that alter the benefits of electoral fiscal cycles even in developed countries. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,337.72,436.62,7.47,5.84">24</ref> Because of the negative consequences of debt, and given the political roots of deficits, policymakers have turned to institutional designs to tie their own hands. Several institutions are shown to limit deficit spending, including balanced budget laws, 25 delegation of agenda power and monitoring over the budget to the executive, 26 contracts among key veto players for multi-annual fiscal programs and spending targets, 27 and limits on parliamentary budget amendments. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,409.83,103.83,7.31,5.84">28</ref> We argue that an additional constraint on fiscal deficits comes from the interaction between fiscal and monetary authorities, i.e., the government and the central bank. The link between fiscal deficits and CBI is an important potential effect of CBI. The early research thought that an autonomous central bank could be an institutional solution for low inflation, which would also lower the cost of capital and improve fiscal performance without jeopardizing economic growth. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,92.92,175.60,7.47,5.84">29</ref> The direct connection from CBI to fiscal deficits has been tested, yet it resulted in mixed findings for both developed countries 30 and developing nations. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,348.78,187.51,7.47,5.84">31</ref> The mixed results have remained unreconciled for several reasons: First, as discussed above, extant research has made little progress in consistently covering the central bank reforms of the last two decades. This has limited not just work on the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy, which is at the heart of this article, but also research on the posited key effect of CBI on inflation. 32 In addition, CBI should deter deficits only if the bank's concern with inflation is credible. Political economy research has made strides in understanding when legal CBI is most likely to be credible. 33 Yet these theoretical innovations have lagged application to the interaction between central banks and fiscal policy. Instead, recent work based on the open economy Mundell-Fleming framework has downplayed the role of central banks in fiscal policy. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.63,307.07,7.47,5.84">34</ref> In this work, independent central banks are argued to lack control over interest rates under fixed exchange rates and mobile international capital because of an assumption that the central bank is tied to defending the fixed rate. Alternatively, CBI is argued to be superfluous, because fiscal policy itself cannot stimulate demand under flexible exchange rates and internationally mobile capital, and will thus not be used by governments.</p><p>The assumptions of the Mundell-Fleming framework 35 can be countered theoretically, however, leaving room for exploring CBI influence. First, it is governments and not central banks that make exchange rate commitments. Independent banks focus on inflation rather than exchange rate stability, so they will not necessarily accommodate expansionary fiscal policy. The consequence is that fiscally irresponsible governments with CBI may have to adjust their exchange rate regimes, as seen in increased exchange rate volatility 36 or less cooperation in the <ref type="bibr" coords="4,70.13,459.84,6.35,4.97">25</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,80.45,461.71,72.29,7.45;4,70.13,469.82,6.35,4.97">Alt and Lawry 1994. 26</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,80.45,471.69,67.41,7.45" target="#b7">Alesina et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,150.69,471.69,98.25,7.45" target="#b52">Hallerberg and Marier 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,251.83,471.69,64.12,7.45" target="#b86">Vlaicu et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,318.78,471.69,57.36,7.45" target="#b87">Von Hagen 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,376.14,471.69,3.81,7.45;4,70.13,479.74,6.35,4.97;4,80.45,481.67,53.85,7.45">. 27 Hallerberg 2004</ref> Wehner 2010. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,70.13,499.70,6.35,4.97">29</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,80.45,501.57,97.17,7.45" target="#b6">Alesina and Summers 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,180.45,501.57,136.12,7.45;4,70.13,509.67,6.35,4.97">Grilli, Masciandaro and Tabellini 1991. 30</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,80.45,511.55,90.14,7.45" target="#b13">Barnhart and Darrat 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,173.36,511.55,91.90,7.45" target="#b30">Burdekin and Laney 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,267.98,511.55,55.41,7.45">Franseze 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,326.15,511.55,116.02,7.45;4,62.36,521.52,19.22,7.45" target="#b49">Grilli, Masciandaro, and Tabellini 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,84.42,521.52,48.76,7.45">Jonsson 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,136.01,521.52,39.11,7.45" target="#b60">Leone 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,175.11,521.52,3.81,7.45;4,70.13,529.57,6.35,4.97;4,80.45,531.45,39.76,7.45">. 31 Bodea 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,126.88,531.45,91.56,7.45;4,70.13,539.55,6.35,4.97">Sikken and de Haan 1998. 32</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,80.45,541.42,86.48,7.45">Bodea and Hicks 2015(a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,70.13,549.53,6.35,4.97;4,80.45,551.40,38.38,7.45">33 Broz 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,162.14,551.40,55.45,7.45;4,70.13,559.45,6.35,4.97;4,80.45,561.38,40.71,7.45">Stasavage 2003. 34 Clark 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,124.04,561.38,94.34,7.45" target="#b33">Clark and Hallerberg 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,221.27,561.38,40.47,7.45" target="#b70">Oatley 1999</ref>. The Mundell-Fleming model expects that the government's use of macroeconomic policy instruments (monetary and fiscal) depends on the international mobility of capital and the choice of exchange rates. With increased capital mobility characterizing the time after the Bretton-Woods period, under a fixed exchange rate, monetary policy is expected to lose autonomy, while under a floating exchange rate fiscal policy is expected to be ineffective in stimulating demand and economic growth. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,70.13,609.28,6.35,4.97">35</ref> We empirically test these assumptions in the robustness section. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,70.13,619.26,6.35,4.97">36</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,80.45,621.13,45.13,7.45" target="#b14">Bearce 2008.</ref> gold standard. 37 Secondly, O'Mahony points out that rigidities in international asset markets and consumers' failure to anticipate higher future taxes may explain why more government spending (surprisingly) generates output and consumption growth even under flexible exchange rates. 38 This implies that governments still have incentives to use fiscal deficits even under flexible exchange rates. It therefore remains a theoretical and empirical question whether and when central banks influence fiscal deficits. We tease out an independent central bank's fiscal policy preferences and explain how deterring fiscal deficits may work. In the next step we tie the successful deterrence of deficits to conditions when central banks can credibly pursue an independent monetary policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Central Bank Preferences</head><p>CBI has long been linked to low inflation. 39 Central bankers are, on average, more conservative with regards to price stability than elected politicians, and legal independence can insulate monetary policy from political cycles, thus moving it closer to the central banker's preferences. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,423.50,233.37,7.47,5.84">40</ref> Central bankers also have conservative preferences over fiscal policy, reflecting the idea that, over the long term, one way to deal with persistent budget deficits is to allow inflation to diminish the value of debt. Recent research substantiates the link convincingly: developed countries with large debt or fiscal deficits pay a premium on long-term interest rates, reflecting bond markets' higher inflationary expectations. 41 There is also evidence that deficits contribute to inflation when the central bank lacks independence. 42 Thus recurring fiscal deficits breed the specter of political pressure to accommodate future inflation.</p><p>Yet the central bank, if independent, can deter deficits by raising government borrowing costs through short-term interest rate increases and by refusing to lend directly to the government. Higher short-term interest rates affect long-term bond rates, thus raising the costs of government financing debt. That is, a combination of fiscal deficits and retaliatory tight monetary policy is likely to increase the interest rates at which markets are willing to finance fiscal deficits. Also, while the central bank is not intent on provoking recessions, higher short-term interest rates also reduce economic growth.</p><p>Real-world examples of central bank statements or retaliatory increases of short-term interest rates are rare, both because interactions between the central bank and the government are not public 43 and because central bank retaliation need not materialize if the bank is successful at <ref type="bibr" coords="5,58.79,459.84,6.35,4.97;5,69.17,461.71,49.82,7.45">37 Simmons 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,118.99,461.71,3.81,7.45;5,58.79,469.82,6.35,4.97;5,69.17,471.69,54.98,7.45">. 38 O'Mahony 2011</ref> Early work includes <ref type="bibr" coords="5,138.56,481.67,123.81,7.45" target="#b39">Cukierman, Webb, and Neyapti 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,262.36,481.67,137.08,7.45" target="#b49">, Grilli, Masciandaro, and Tabellini 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,399.44,481.67,31.39,7.45;5,51.02,491.65,64.73,7.45" target="#b6">, Alesina and Summers 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,115.76,491.65,3.81,7.45;5,58.79,499.70,6.35,4.97;5,69.17,501.57,43.33,7.45">. 40 Blinder 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,119.17,501.57,54.31,7.45" target="#b62">Lohmann 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,176.31,501.57,41.89,7.45" target="#b77">Rogoff 1985</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,58.79,509.67,6.35,4.97">41</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="5,69.17,511.55,115.43,7.45" target="#b11">Ardagna, Caselli, and Lane 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,187.37,511.55,92.18,7.45">Baldacci and Kumar 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,282.27,511.55,46.93,7.45" target="#b59">Laubach 2009</ref>.

Still, surveys show that in industrial countries fiscal policy is the topic of 40 per cent of high-level talks between the central bank and the government <ref type="bibr" coords="5,404.74,571.30,26.13,7.45;5,51.02,581.28,44.28,7.45" target="#b67">(Moser-Boehm 2006)</ref>.

More directly, in 2011 the European Central Bank (ECB) used secret correspondence (that leaked to the press) to demand sweeping deficit cuts from Italy, Ireland and Spain. These and additional measures were required as a condition for ECB buying Italian and Spanish bonds from the market to try to reduce the high interest rates that markets demanded of these countries. deterring fiscal deficits. Still, one clear example comes from the German Bundesbank. In January 1955 the German central bank warned the government not to turn to fiscal deficits while the economy was experiencing economic growth. The initial admonitions were followed by the 'highly visible warning signal of a higher discount rate in August 1955' 44 and by two additional interest rate increases in 1956, both linked very publicly by the central bank's council to the government's fiscal policy. In another example, Beck shows that the US Federal Reserve responded with interest rate increases to fiscal deficits starting in the 1970s, which he attributes to the Fed's newly found independence. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,225.07,139.72,7.47,5.84">45</ref> Besides interest rate retaliation, central bank laws limit a bank's ability to provide funds directly to governments or give it more control over the financing conditions, including the maturity and cost of lending. Losing access to cheap money provided by the central bank increases the costs of fiscal deficits that need to be financed by markets. Franzese, for example, argues that CBI may dissuade debt accumulation because governments anticipate a future inability to inflate debt. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,156.19,211.43,7.47,5.84">46</ref> Tabellini suggests that this was precisely the interaction between the Italian Treasury and the Bank of Italy in 1981, after the Bank stopped having a legal obligation to purchase any public debt unsold directly to investors. 47 Central bank financing of budget deficits is likely a larger problem in developing countries with weak financial markets. 48 Still, even industrial countries derive utility from access to borrowing from their central bank. For example, the British government maintains its ability to borrow directly from the Bank of England and has used it in the most recent financial crisis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHEN DO CENTRAL BANKS PURSUE THEIR FISCAL POLICY PREFERENCES?</head><p>As explained above, the legal, institutional independence of monetary policy has the potential to influence fiscal deficits. Yet politicians have incentives to subvert the institutional independence of the central bank. The central bank law is inherently incomplete and can be changed (or threatened to be changed) by politicians in order to make central bankers more subservient. Central bank governors can also be fired prematurely, and their appointment may be conditioned by a subservient monetary policy. Therefore, rather than the legal independence codified in central bank law, some of the economics literature looks at central bank governor tenure or expert surveys to distinguish de facto bank autonomy. 49 Long tenures, however, may be a result of both autonomy and the lack of it. Dreher, Sturm and de Haan, for example, show that central bankers lose their jobs for high inflation, which makes turnover a poor indicator of de facto CBI. 50 Also, surveys are limited to small samples and could be biased as they are filled out by central bank experts.</p><p>We favor a political economy approach that emphasizes legal rules and the conditions under which such rules have practical effects on behavior.

This advantage increases the credibility of monetary policy delegation to an independent central bank and, we argue, raises the likelihood of retaliatory monetary policy in response to fiscal policy, which can deter fiscal deficits. Yet even if we uncover an average CBI effect on fiscal deficits in countries with rule of law and impartial contract enforcement, this effect may come from fundamentally different central bank behaviors. On the one hand, the central bank may prompt governments to adopt a fiscal policy countering the macro-economic cycle, incentivizing surpluses or balanced budgets in good times. On the other hand, as we argue, the alternation of surpluses and deficits can emerge when the central bank pragmatically guards its formal, de jure, independence by accommodating politicians under circumstances related to the electoral calendar or government partisanship. Below we detail our argument and derive testable hypotheses.</p><p>Broadly, a lasting democracy is linked to secure property rights and contract enforcement, and both are premised on the judiciary's independence and respect for the rule of law and individual rights. 52 This means that, in dictatorships, the enforcement of legislation aimed to tie the hands of government is highly uncertain. A first condition that helps the broad rule of law prevail in democracies is the strength of constraints on government power. Very directly, the political opposition has an interest in guarding the independence of the central bank because independence denies the incumbent the opportunistic use of monetary policy and limits the use of fiscal policy. Coalition partners in the executive and the opposition also have reasons to protect the independence of the central bank, because it provides information about government policy choices. 53 Indeed, the presence of two or more veto players reduces the probability that the central bank will be overridden on decisions regarding inflation or that the central bank law will be amended. This in turn increases the credibility of independent central banks in pursuing the mandated task of maintaining price stability and results in lower inflation. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,86.51,366.89,7.47,5.84">54</ref> A second condition that helps the broad rule of law is the transparency of political decisions. Relatively more transparent political systems like democracies impose costs against opportunistic behavior by the government. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,223.88,402.72,7.47,5.84">55</ref> Since central banks are opaque in their decision making, the 'true' independence of some of their actions is difficult to monitor. 56 In democracies, the political opposition can denounce transgressions against CBI and the voters can punish transgressions at the ballot box. Such actions from domestic political actors and the public are more likely when the press is free to report, and when elections are free and competitive. 57 Following the theoretical discussion, a first testable hypothesis links deterrence of fiscal deficits to credible institutional CBI: 58 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,58.79,499.70,6.35,4.97;7,69.17,501.57,52.56,7.45">51 Bernhard 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,123.87,501.57,84.58,7.45">Bodea and Hicks 2015(a)</ref> <ref type="bibr" coords="7,208.45,501.57,3.55,7.45">;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,214.17,501.57,37.65,7.45" target="#b29">Broz 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,253.97,501.57,57.09,7.45" target="#b50">Hallerberg 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,313.21,501.57,94.05,7.45" target="#b58">Keefer and Stasavage 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,409.41,501.57,21.42,7.45;7,51.02,511.55,15.24,7.45" target="#b66">Moser 1999</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,58.79,519.60,6.35,4.97">52</ref> Olson 1993. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,58.79,529.57,6.35,4.97;7,69.17,531.45,53.24,7.45">53 Bernhard 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,125.23,531.45,40.47,7.45" target="#b36">Crowe 2008</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,58.79,539.55,6.35,4.97">54</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="7,69.17,541.42,96.04,7.45" target="#b58">Keefer and Stasavage 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,168.03,541.42,39.51,7.45" target="#b66">Moser 1999</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,58.79,549.53,6.35,4.97;7,69.17,551.40,34.35,7.45">55 Broz 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,103.51,551.40,3.81,7.45;7,58.79,559.45,6.35,4.97;7,69.17,561.38,39.70,7.45">. 56 Bodea 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,115.54,561.38,38.22,7.45;7,58.79,569.43,6.35,4.97">Broz 2002. 57</ref> Evidence on this causal chain comes from the literature on political business cycles: electoral fiscal cycles are smaller when the local press is developed <ref type="bibr" coords="7,208.17,581.28,121.61,7.45" target="#b0">(Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya 2004)</ref>, where voters have access to information via a free press  or when the transparency of fiscal policy is high <ref type="bibr" coords="7,402.74,591.26,28.10,7.45;7,51.02,601.24,44.28,7.45" target="#b9">(Alt and Lassen 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,58.79,609.28,6.35,4.97">58</ref> A similar hypothesis is derived in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,184.19,611.16,46.03,7.45" target="#b25">Bodea (2013)</ref> and tested using a much smaller sample of post-communist states <ref type="bibr" coords="7,72.40,621.13,19.02,7.45">(1990)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1991)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1992)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1993)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1994)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1995)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1996)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1997)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1998)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(1999)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(2000)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,91.42,621.13,3.80,7.45">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,95.22,621.13,19.02,7.45">(2002)</ref>. HYPOTHESIS 1: Central bank independence reduces fiscal deficits predominantly in democracies, and countries with strong rule of law, political constraints on the executive and a transparent political system. The features of democracy described above should help legal CBI deter fiscal deficits. Yet even in countries with strong rule of law and contract enforcement, it is not necessary for the bank to use political capital to oppose deficits in every budget. First, this is the case because deficits are not consistently bad for inflation and macroeconomic stability if fiscal consolidation follows. More important, however, fiscal policy is not part of the legal mandate of an independent central bank, even if, in the long run, debt accumulation through deficit spending affects inflation expectations and inflation, which are of direct concern to the bank. As long as they are market financed, fiscal deficits are not the formal domain of central banks. There is little dispute that CBI remains contested in the political arena. 59 As we note above, politicians can threaten to change the law, and can circumvent the law through the process of appointment and dismissal of central bank governors and boards. Our argument is that the central bank needs to be selective in choosing fights related to policies outside its direct mandate, like fiscal policy.</p><p>We use Lohmann's framework to identify conditions under which the central bank voluntarily backs down. 60 In her model, the central bank is independent, but, reflecting reality, the government retains the flexibility to override the bank at some cost. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,356.77,265.24,7.47,5.84">61</ref> In this interaction, Lohmann shows that it is optimal for the central bank to accommodate the government's demands in extreme situations for fear of being overridden. Thus in normal times, the central bank decides on monetary policy. When facing large negative shocks to economic growth, however, the bank adopts politicians' preferences since the government's utility loss from low growth is higher than the cost of overriding the central bank. We would expect a similar situation for office-seeking politicians when they bid for re-election: large losses to government utility will result from a conservative monetary policy response to fiscal policy around election times, prompting the central bank to accommodate the government. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,336.59,360.88,7.47,5.84">62</ref> Therefore, even if the central bank prefers fiscal balance, it may be reluctant to pursue it when the government has little appetite for fiscal consolidation and, consequently, the risk of backlash against independence is higher. Recent work indicates that electoral cycles continue to exist in less-developed countries and new democracies. 63 So, particularly in such countries, election years entail strong incentives for incumbents to manipulate the economy and are therefore not ideal for the central bank to press for budget surpluses. This discussion leads to the following hypothesis: HYPOTHESIS 1a: Especially in new democracies, central bank independence is more likely to contribute to fiscal consolidation outside the electoral cycle.</p><p>Moreover, the central bank may find it preferable to push the political costs of expenditure cuts or tax increases on particular political actors. A key premise in the CBI literature is that the <ref type="bibr" coords="8,70.13,519.60,6.35,4.97;8,80.45,521.52,39.35,7.45">59 Beck 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,122.63,521.52,51.82,7.45" target="#b45">Franzese 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,177.28,521.52,50.33,7.45" target="#b62">Lohmann 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,234.25,521.52,15.24,7.45" target="#b62">Lohmann , 1998</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,70.13,529.57,6.35,4.97;8,80.45,531.45,54.20,7.45;8,70.13,539.55,6.35,4.97">60 Lohmann 1992. 61</ref> Being overridden may mean losing one's job or facing changes in the central bank law or the bank's governance structure, or hostile appointments to the bank's governing bodies.

This conservatism is generally argued not to have a partisan element but to be an objective preference. <ref type="bibr" coords="9,134.14,91.87,7.47,5.84">65</ref> Others, however, argue that there is a political bias in how independent central banks set interest rates. <ref type="bibr" coords="9,176.83,103.83,7.47,5.84">66</ref> The non-neutrality of interest rates arises, according to this view, because the preferences of independent and conservative central banks are a natural fit with the agendas of right-wing governments, as evidenced by central bankers' backgrounds, financial markets constraining their appointment and the professional socialization of bankers. This fit between independent central bankers and the political right is reflected in the coordination of fiscal and monetary policies or monetary policy aimed at keeping the right in office. <ref type="bibr" coords="9,75.97,175.60,7.47,5.84">67</ref> For us, the potential biasand the fact that left-wing parties may see higher central bank interest ratesimplies that the left has incentives to reduce fiscal deficits. This is because high interest rates imply additional costs for financing debt and, more importantly, because recessions induced by such high rates tend to disproportionally hurt those with lower skills and income, which are the left's constituency. <ref type="bibr" coords="9,219.97,235.36,7.47,5.84">68</ref> In addition to the non-neutrality of central banks, there may be other reasons for CBI to have more influence on fiscal policy when the left is in power. The left may simply be more receptive to prods for fiscal discipline due to higher expectations of inflation under left-wing governments 69 and thus higher market interest rates on government debt. The central bank's push for fiscal balance then usefully serves to placate the left's own constituency and supply information on the likely capital market reaction to budget plans, as well as provide focal point estimates on amounts of deficit cutting and time horizons for the cuts. 70 Thus independent central banks can be expected to contribute differently to fiscal consolidation during the tenure of left-versus right-wing governments.  <ref type="bibr" coords="9,58.79,479.74,6.35,4.97;9,69.17,481.67,54.31,7.45">65 Bernhard 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,127.33,481.67,101.76,7.45" target="#b20">Bernhard and Leblang 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,232.95,481.67,48.25,7.45" target="#b21">Blinder 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,285.04,481.67,41.55,7.45" target="#b36">Crowe 2008</ref>.

We add 10 to the Polity IV score and convert the range to a scale from 0 to 20, with high scores indicating democracies. We supplement Polity scores with Freedom House data, which is the sum of a country's political rights (1-7) and civil liberties (1-7). We rescale the original data, so that lower scores correspond to autocratic regimes and high scores denote democracies, ranging from 0 to 12. In addition, we use Linzer and Staton for a measure of latent judicial independence that varies between 0 and 1. 76 They use eight distinct sources of data that code various aspects of de facto judicial independence, and their measure aims to capture the commonality of coding across the different data sources. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,113.33,366.89,7.47,5.84">77</ref> We also test the specific mechanisms that should aid democracies with legal CBI lower fiscal deficits.

The Polity IV executive constraints measure shows the degree to which the executive considers the preferences of other societal 72 Expenditure is total central government expenditure relative to GDP.

First, using country-fixed effects in an OLS regression with lagged dependent variables also introduces bias, a problem aggravated by the relatively small time duration for many countries in our data set. For example, postcommunist countries are in the sample for nine to fifteen years, which does not allow shocks to fixed effects to diminish over time (the Nickell bias). 90 Secondly, the CBI index and Polity IV scores vary little within countries, and fixed-effects models lead to greatly inefficient estimations. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,109.76,356.91,7.47,5.84">91</ref> To address these problems, we present system GMM models. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,384.78,356.91,7.47,5.84">92</ref> The GMM estimation deals with several shortcomings in the data, including the short time span in the sample, fixed individual effects, and potential heteroscedasticity and auto-correlation within countries. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,101.03,392.74,7.47,5.84">93</ref> In the GMM regressions, we only use up to the second lag of the variables for the regression in levels, in order to reduce the number of instruments and the risk of over-fitting the data. Also, we report two standard specification tests. First, the Hansen test of over-identifying restrictions tests the overall validity of the instruments, and failure to reject the null hypothesis gives support for the model, including our choice of endogenous variables. Secondly, the Arellano-Bond test for AR(2) in first differences tests whether the residuals from the regression in differences is second-order serially correlated; again, the failure to reject the null hypothesis supports the model specification.</p><p>In particular, both CBI and fiscal deficits may be driven by a country's culture and aversion to macro-economic instability. Our results are robust to including a country's inflation history to proxy for such aversion, which helps mitigate this concern. 86 This research design does not capture the strategic interaction between governments and central banks, but instead the outcome of equilibrium behavior. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,70.13,549.53,6.35,4.97">87</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="12,80.45,551.40,72.80,7.45;12,70.13,559.45,6.35,4.97">Beck and Katz 1995. 88</ref> The lagged dependent variable also addresses potential autocorrelation <ref type="bibr" coords="12,325.58,561.38,74.56,7.45" target="#b16">(Beck and Katz 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,70.13,569.43,6.35,4.97">89</ref> Gasiorowski 2000. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,70.13,579.41,6.35,4.97">90</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="12,80.45,581.28,72.97,7.45" target="#b16">Beck and Katz 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,156.24,581.28,58.21,7.45" target="#b88">Wooldridge 2002</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,70.13,589.33,6.35,4.97">91</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="12,80.45,591.26,94.62,7.45;12,70.13,599.31,6.35,4.97">PlÃ¼mper and Troeger 2007. 92</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="12,80.45,601.24,89.75,7.45" target="#b12">Arellano and Bover 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,173.02,601.24,43.92,7.45" target="#b22">Blundell and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,219.79,601.24,40.20,7.45;12,70.13,609.28,6.35,4.97;12,80.45,611.16,50.45,7.45">Bond 1998. 93 Roodman 2009</ref>.

Using the CBI index and Polity IV scores individually in the model, we find that the coefficient of the CBI index is positive but statistically insignificant.

Polity IV scores negatively impact fiscal balance, which is consistent with extant work, 94 but, again, the variable is not statistically significant.</p><p>Next, Models 2-6 test Hypothesis 1 by considering the conditional effect of the CBI index on fiscal deficits. To estimate the impact of legal CBI conditional on a country's level of democracy, we introduce an interaction term between the CBI index and the Polity IV score.

The coefficient of the Polity IV score remains statistically significant, while the coefficient of the interaction term between the CBI index and the Polity IV score goes below the usual threshold for statistical significance. However, graphing the marginal effect of CBI from the fixed-effects model shows a significant effect for high levels of Polity IV scores (Appendix <ref type="figure" coords="13,51.02,339.17,38.85,8.77" target="#fig_1">Figure A1</ref>), similar to the figures based on system GMM models shown below. <ref type="bibr" coords="13,384.26,336.95,7.47,5.84">97</ref> Model 5 shows that the results are robust to using the Freedom House index: the interaction of the CBI index with the democracy measure is positive and statistically significant.

These findings support our Hypothesis 1: strong democracies and rule of law and impartial contract enforcement enable independent central bankers to deter fiscal deficits. The marginal effect shows an improvement in the fiscal deficit of about 0.7 percentage points in democracies. Given that the average fiscal deficit for democracies in the sample is â1.6 per cent of GDP, the marginal effect of CBI is quite large. In Latin America, Chile and Uruguay provide an illustration of the results. Chile started off the continent-wide reform of central bank legislation. That is, in 1989 Chile both transitioned to democracy and reformed the institutional foundations of its central bank, making it one of the most independent in the world (CBI index = 0.89). Uruguay returned to democracy in 1985, yet failed to reform its central bank until 1995/1997; even then, its legislation was far from that passed in Chile (CBI index = 0.49). The fiscal performance of the two countries between 1989 and 2007 plausibly reflects the difference in central bank legislation, with Uruguay having an average deficit of â1.2 per cent of GDP and Chile an average surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP. While we control here for other factors that affect fiscal balance, Hallerberg and Marier support our comparison as they rank the two countries closely on both executive strength and incentives for personal vote in the legislature, two key features they show are strongly related to fiscal indiscipline. 100 Regarding our controls, only the oil and gas rents per capita variable, trade openness and inflation have a statistically significant effect across the models. Intuitively, higher oil revenue leads to fiscal surpluses. Also, high-inflation countries and trade-open countries have surpluses. For other variables, the coefficients go in the expected direction, but many do not achieve statistical significance. Both better economic growth and higher GDP per capita tend to improve fiscal performance, but are not consistently significant; election years worsen the fiscal balance, but the variable is significant in only some of the specifications. On the other hand, de facto fixed exchange rates, capital controls, old-age population and strikes do not appear to significantly affect our results.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="16,66.29,58.01,196.64,296.10">(a) (b) (d) (c) (e)<label>(f)</label></formula><p>To test the hypothesized causal mechanisms, we use interactions of the CBI index with two measures of constraints on the power of the executive and one measure of press freedom.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elections and Partisanship</head><p>Central banks may react to deficits in an optimal counter-cyclical fashion, allowing fiscal policy to respond to recessions with additional spending and opposing deficits during good times. We find, however, no evidence that the effect of CBI is conditioned by economic growth, and this holds in both our full sample and only in democracies, with a continuous measure of economic growth or cut-offs for various levels of positive growth. To test Hypotheses 1a and 1b and our own view of a strategic central bank that guards its legal independence, we limit our sample to democracies. <ref type="bibr" coords="18,114.12,283.15,11.21,5.84">101</ref> We then first re-estimate the system GMM model of fiscal balance to include an interaction of the CBI index with the indicator variable for elections. Coefficients are in Appendix <ref type="table" coords="18,104.37,309.30,37.42,8.77">Table A5</ref> (Models 12 and 13). <ref type="figure" coords="18,228.81,309.30,37.91,8.77">Figure 3a</ref> shows the marginal effect of the CBI index in election years versus non-election years for all democracies: in non-election years, the marginal effect of CBI is 1.2 per cent (statistically significant at the 90 per cent confidence level). In contrast, in election years, the CBI marginal effect is on average 0 and statistically insignificant. Next, we exclude from the sample Western democracies <ref type="figure" coords="18,355.18,357.15,40.88,8.77">(Figure 3b</ref>). For new (non-Western) democracies, the effects are larger, but similar in terms of statistical significance: in non-election years, the marginal effect of the CBI index is 2.6 per cent and statistically significant (90 per cent confidence level), while the marginal effect in election years is about 1 per cent but statistically insignificant. This evidence indicates that the effect of CBI on fiscal consolidation is likely to come from non-election years, and the average effect appears to be larger in new democracies. <ref type="bibr" coords="18,180.51,426.64,11.21,5.84">102</ref> We also use our whole sample (both democracies and dictatorships) to estimate a model that includes an interaction between the CBI index and the indicator for election years.

For all democracies <ref type="figure" coords="19,369.07,261.51,39.35,8.77">(Figure 4a</ref>), the marginal effect of CBI is about 1.2 per cent and statistically significant (90 per cent confidence level) for left-wing executives, while it is about 0.6 per cent and statistically insignificant for the right. The same holds for the sample of non-Western democracies: the marginal effect of CBI for left-wing executives is large, at about 4 per cent and statistically significant (90 per cent confidence). The marginal effect is statistically insignificant for the right. As explained earlier, two different mechanisms could drive this finding, and we find support for both. It may be the case that the left takes advantage of a nominally independent central bank to counter spending demands by its own constituency. We test this explanation by using our whole sample (democracies and dictatorships) to estimate a model that includes an interaction between CBI and the indicator for left-wing governments. The whole-sample results closely resemble the estimates from using just democratic countries, indicating fiscal consolidation under the left even with a central bank that is nominally independent but virtually under the thumb of the government. The alternative explanation is that the independent central bank is more eager to prevent spending by the left, due to an ideological proximity to the political right. If the central bank is successful at deterrence, we need not observe actual reactions of monetary policy to fiscal deficits. Still, we follow earlier work and look at the reaction of deposit rates (WDI) and changes in money supply (M2 change, IFS and WDI) 104 in models that include a triple interaction of the fiscal deficit, CBI and the indicator for left-wing governments as independent variables. <ref type="bibr" coords="19,197.24,474.43,10.60,5.84">105</ref> The results show no conditional effect of CBI on deposit rates. However, there is support for non-neutral central banks coming from the M2 change models. Similar to Cusack, we find that the central bank accommodates the right. 106 For large fiscal deficits of the left (greater than about 5 per cent of GDP), the central bank reduces rates of money growth, responding with contractionary monetary policy to fiscal stimulus. However, central banks do not appear to reduce the rates of money growth in response to right-wing fiscal deficits.</p></div>

The estimation results using data from seventyeight countries  are robust and strongly support our theory: CBI reduces fiscal deficits in democracies and countries with rule of law, high constraints on the executive and a free press. Reforming a country's central bank and granting it more legal independence have been clear trends in the past two decades. Following the trend, non-democracies like Venezuela, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia have central banks with great nominal independence. However, extant research finds that the anti-inflationary effect of CBI is conditioned on political institutions. <ref type="bibr" coords="20,108.74,169.59,11.21,5.84" target="#b1">107</ref> Our research shows that CBI is also unlikely to affect the fiscal balance of autocratic countries. Given this inability to improve outcomes such as inflation or fiscal deficits, why do non-democracies delegate in the first place? Using our new data, future work on institutional authoritarianism can provide answers to this question, expanding extant explanations related to countries' perceived higher need for investment 108 or diffusion. <ref type="bibr" coords="20,414.14,217.44,11.21,5.84" target="#b2">109</ref> Yet several democracies in our sample have either been late to give more independence to their central bank (Turkey, Thailand) or have delegated only partially (Uruguay, South Africa, Mongolia, South Korea, Israel). For such countries we show that fiscal discipline can be strengthened by further reforming the central bank. Since the 2007 economic crisis, CBI has again become a hotly debated issue, with many arguing that politicians should be more active in monetary policy and that central banks should be more responsive to recessions. <ref type="bibr" coords="20,239.87,289.16,10.77,5.84" target="#b3">110</ref> Globally, inflation is currently not a great concern, so political interference in monetary policy may seem inconsequential. Our research suggests, however, that fiscal deficits are a likely consequence of curtailed CBI.</p><p>Yet we also provide evidence that, when pressing for fiscal consolidation, legally independent central banks may be political and non-neutral. In democracies, where legal CBI is credible, we find no evidence that, on average, central banks have an interest in using fiscal policy in a counter-cyclical fashion. Rather, our results show that the central bank is more likely to contribute to fiscal surpluses outside election years. Thus even if CBI can contribute to fiscal consolidation, it is unlikely to reduce political business cycles the way that increased transparency of budgets 111 or a better-informed electorate do. <ref type="bibr" coords="20,112.65,396.76,10.71,5.84" target="#b4">112</ref> Fiscal institutions have been shown to mitigate the common-pool resource problem in fiscal policy. <ref type="bibr" coords="20,120.02,408.73,10.71,5.84" target="#b5">113</ref> However, future work can investigate whether such budgetary institutions, similar to CBI, are more (or less) effective in reducing deficits, depending on the electoral cycle. Moreover, an independent central bank appears more likely to contribute to a balanced budget under left-wing governments. We find mixed reasons for this behavior, and future work can further investigate the reasons why CBI is more successful at deterring the deficits of the left.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="9,51.02,351.14,379.77,8.77;9,118.94,363.10,216.05,8.77;9,51.02,396.67,114.78,6.58;9,51.02,412.93,379.80,8.77;9,51.02,424.89,372.96,8.77;9,423.72,422.67,7.14,5.84;9,51.02,436.86,379.82,8.77;9,51.02,448.76,379.90,8.77;9,58.79,469.82,6.35,4.97;9,69.17,471.69,45.64,7.45"><head>HYPOTHESIS 1b :</head><label>1b</label><figDesc>In democracies, central bank independence is more likely to lead to budget surpluses/lower deficits under left-wing governments.DATA AND METHODOLOGYWe use an annual dataset covering seventy-eight countries from 1970 to 2007.
