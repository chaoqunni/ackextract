Most scholars believe that this transition is explained by the rise of capitalism but have long disagreed about why it mattered. The author argues that dominant models fail to capture why capitalist development helps key actors win what they seek. Drawing on comparative and historical work, the author introduces a model of the democratic transition that centers on the concept of disruptive capacity.

In cross-national regressions, the author finds evidence that the disruptive capacity of nonelites drives democratic gains, and the finding that landlord capacity stymies it is reproduced. Counterfactual exercises show that slightly more than half of the democracy gap between the developing and developed world can be explained by the fact that late development bolstered landlords while handicapping nonelites. 1 I thank the many people who gave excellent feedback on drafts of this article, includ-</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>As recently as 150 years ago, ordinary individuals had little influence over the decisions that most affected their lives. Economic elites paid scant notice to those who tilled their fields or operated their machines. Political elites launched wars and enacted taxes without regard for those under their writ. Nonelites were disenfranchised.</p><p>Eventually these regimes crumbled. The democratic transition swept Western Europe and, over the course of the 20th century, refashioned most of the world's governments in its image. Democratization revolutionized authority, transforming subjects into citizens, autocrats into politicians, and barons into employers. Although authoritarian regimes linger, and political democracy has not eliminated inequalities of income and wealth, these changes amount to a remarkable transformation in the exercise of power.</p><p>What explains democracy? In what follows, I reconsider how ordinary individuals wrested political concessions from their economic and political masters. Most work on the democratic transition begins from the observation that this sea change in political life followed epochal transformations of the economy. For some, this correlation licenses the causal claim that capitalist development has itself incubated democratic government. Classic accounts argue that modernization breeds democracy because it raises standards of living, extends the division of labor, and transforms individual values <ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.56,297.18,54.25,8.58" target="#b63">(Lipset 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.54,297.18,61.45,8.58" target="#b26">Cutright 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,226.66,297.18,112.79,8.58" target="#b119">Welzel and Inglehart 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Recent scholarship has challenged this focus on what are benign and conflict-free mechanisms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,181.82,321.16,47.33,8.58" target="#b16">(Boix 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,231.37,321.16,127.95,8.58" target="#b1">Acemoglu and Robinson 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,361.54,321.16,26.32,8.58;2,75.86,333.18,76.90,8.58" target="#b8">Ansell and Samuels 2014)</ref>. These authors do not dispute that democracy is endogenous to development, but they argue that capitalism matters via the class struggle that it detonates. Specifically, development shapes patterns of inequality, which in turn structure the contest between contending classes over the form of government. Where this struggle tilts in favor of ordinary individuals, democracy is more likely.</p><p>In my view, these scholars are right to object that democratization is riddled with conflict. They are also right to agree that it is endogenous to economic development. Other accounts may explain much that is interesting about the variation in democracy across countries and across time, but these arguments complement rather than supplant the endogenous tradition. That said, the endogenous view needs reformulating. The new inequality-based accounts have either ignored or misunderstood the conditions under which actors acquire the capacity to credibly demand (or oppose) democracy. This casts doubt on the evidence that has thus far been used to test that view.</p><p>In this article, I argue that development matters because it shapes the ability of ordinary people to disrupt the routines on which economic and political elites depend. As I argue below, these disruptive capacities determine the balance of power between elites and nonelites, which in turn shapes the character of government. Here I draw on an existing and distinct tradition, which has argued that development matters because it empowers democracy's proponents and defangs its detractors <ref type="bibr" coords="2,259.09,585.18,64.18,8.58" target="#b108">(Stephens 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,325.42,585.18,62.53,8.58;2,75.85,597.20,121.42,8.58" target="#b96">Rueschemeyer, Stephens, and Stephens 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Democracy and the Class Struggle I make two contributions to this literature. First, I reconstruct the underlying theory in a way that helps identify the errors of the reigning conflictcentered paradigm. Key to my formalization is the concept of disruptive capacity, which helps explain why elites are more powerful than nonelites, why this balance of power shifts with economic development, and why these shifts usher in democracy. Second, I propose an empirical test. Existing evidence for the account is based mostly on case studies, several of which are contested. In fact, a recent review of the scholarship finds little quantitative evidence for what the author labels the "social forces" view <ref type="bibr" coords="3,339.82,189.18,58.07,8.58;3,85.89,201.19,25.63,8.58">(Teorell 2010, p. 101)</ref>. Drawing on an original data set documenting employment structures from the 19th century to the present, spanning almost 200 countries, I subject this thesis to its first adequate quantitative test. Panel regressions show significant support for the hypothesis that nonelite disruptive capacity drives democratic change, and I reproduce the well-known finding that landlord power imperils it.</p><p>While the capacity-enhancing consequences of development may explain democratization, this does not mean they are the only explanation. I find some support for both the inequality-centric and modernization arguments, as well as a diffusion-based explanation, although none of these findings are as robust as my main results. To illustrate the political significance of the social forces account, I explore how well it explains differences in levels of democracy between the advanced and developing worlds. I find that slightly more than half of this gap is explained by the structural facts that handicapped nonelites while empowering landlords. Had capacities there accumulated as they did in the developed world, the 20th century would have been a remarkably more democratic time.</p></div>

The majority of quantitative evidence illustrating a link between development and democracy is cross-national, but cross-national associations are weak grounds for causal inference. This argument was made in detail by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,126.77,225.18,68.54,8.58" target="#b90">Robinson (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="4,217.08,225.18,89.77,8.58" target="#b2">Acemoglu et al.

More recent scholarship has recovered support for the impact of development on democracy by extending the sample backward in time, using newer GDP per capita data and employing more suitable estimators <ref type="bibr" coords="4,156.08,309.19,47.05,8.58" target="#b16">(Boix 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,205.12,309.19,162.76,8.58" target="#b13">Benhabib, Corvalan, and Spiegel 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,369.87,309.19,13.49,8.58;4,75.85,321.16,35.43,8.58" target="#b69">Miller 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,113.27,321.16,114.97,8.58" target="#b76">Murtin and Wacziarg 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,230.23,321.16,63.69,8.58" target="#b114">Treisman 2015)</ref>. However, the overall lesson is that development itself has more complicated and less immediate consequences than previously believed. There are, of course, other mechanisms by which modernization might incubate democracy. In the analysis that follows I measure three ways in which modernization is believed to matter (aggregate income, educational attainment, urbanization) and find weak support for only the second of these three channels.</p><p>This empirical issue also betrays a theoretical weakness. The theory has underdeveloped microfoundations. Staple accounts do not give much thought to the actors who actually fashion or obstruct the democratic transition. Richer citizens may be more tolerant, for instance, but they may be more interested in stabilizing a regime that raises their incomes than in democratizing it. Education might encourage breadth of outlook, but it may also produce incentives to lock the less educated out of the political process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inequality and the Class Struggle</head><p>Recent work by political scientists and economists addresses this lacuna by modeling the interests and capacities of the key actors in the democratic transition. These scholars propose game-theoretic formalizations in which elites and nonelites struggle over the organization of political authority. Each of the three dominant models predicts that it is not wealth but its distribution that determines whether democracy will flourish <ref type="bibr" coords="5,288.57,117.17,47.05,8.58" target="#b16">(Boix 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,337.49,117.17,60.38,8.58;5,85.89,129.19,65.76,8.58" target="#b1">Acemoglu and Robinson 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,154.60,129.19,107.46,8.58" target="#b8">Ansell and Samuels 2014)</ref>. These authors are not the first to foreground inequality <ref type="bibr" coords="5,189.30,141.16,112.81,8.58" target="#b18">(Bollen and Jackman 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,304.16,141.16,51.56,8.58" target="#b75">Muller 1988)</ref>, but their work is the clearest expression of the view that it should matter.</p><p>For Boix and Acemoglu and Robinson, this conclusion follows from the premise that majority-rule democracies will follow the lead of the median voter, whereas dictatorships face no such pressure <ref type="bibr" coords="5,305.75,189.18,92.08,8.58;5,85.89,201.19,21.00,8.58" target="#b68">(Meltzer and Richard 1981)</ref>. They will thus redistribute more where inequality is higher, since there the median voter earns less than the mean. For Boix, this establishes that inequality inhibits democracy because it raises the costs of a redistributive state to asset-rich elites. Acemoglu and Robinson argue that the probability of transition takes the shape of an inverted U: at low inequality nonelites will realize that the costs of attempting to overthrow elites will outweigh benefits gained, and at high inequality elites are more likely to dig in their heels. Democracy is thus most likely at middling levels of inequality.</p><p>Both these models have been criticized by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,281.71,297.18,112.13,8.58" target="#b8">Ansell and Samuels (2014)</ref>, who instead foreground intraelite competition. Ansell and Samuels model a two-sector economy in which three actors compete over control of the state, which requires them to distinguish among three types of inequality (industrial, landed, and intersectoral). Their flagship prediction is that industrial inequality (which they measure as income inequality) actually makes democracy more and not less likely, because it empowers a prodemocratic bourgeoisie <ref type="bibr" coords="5,115.71,381.20,131.51,8.58">(Ansell and Samuels 2014, p. 80)</ref>. Landed inequality empowers landlords, endangering democracy. Importantly, the model makes ambiguous predictions about the role of nonelites, who thus drop out of their interpretations of their empirical evidence. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,230.63,416.74,3.00,4.58">4</ref> This work has obvious virtues. Formalization mandates clarity. The modernization account did not carefully consider how (i.e., through whom) development led to democracy. These scholars have thus been able to propose more suitable empirical tests of their theories. For instance, both Boix and Ansell and Samuels emphasize the antidemocratic preferences of landlords. This has mandated indicators of landlord capacity, one of which I describe and employ in this article.</p><p>However, while they draw attention to the actors demanding or opposing transition-to the class struggle over democracy-these accounts fail to capture the circumstances under which nonelites pose a threat. Boix and Ace-moglu and Robinson assume that the capacity of nonelites to rebel (and thus win democracy) cannot be modeled. As a result, income inequality matters because it makes democracy more or less desirable, not because it shapes capacities for collective action. 5 For Ansell and Samuels, inequality bears on both incentives and capacities, but collective action is a straightforward consequence of the resources actors possess. Put another way, more income, more bargaining power. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,177.51,164.74,3.00,4.58">6</ref> Both of these approaches are mistaken. Others have noted this <ref type="bibr" coords="6,360.46,177.16,27.36,8.58;6,75.85,189.17,22.50,8.58" target="#b100">(Slater 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,100.57,189.17,121.46,8.58">Haggard and Kaufman 2016)</ref>, but my article proposes a revision that retains the view that the class struggle is endogenous to capitalist development. The ability of nonelites to act collectively is not a function of their resources, conventionally understood (whether absolutely or relative to elites). Collective action is not a commodity. Rather, nonelites are more likely to organize when they are positioned to disrupt the routines on which elites depend for their wealth and power. To furnish evidence for this view, I draw on an original data set of the labor force composition of almost 200 countries over most of the modern period.</p><p>Most of the evidence thus far has centered on the prediction that levels of inequality should be somehow associated with democratization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,340.67,309.20,47.22,8.58" target="#b16">(Boix 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,75.85,321.16,50.68,8.58" target="#b45">Houle 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,128.86,321.16,49.54,8.58" target="#b103">Soifer 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,180.74,321.16,107.09,8.58" target="#b8">Ansell and Samuels 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,290.16,321.16,97.73,8.58;6,75.85,333.18,21.00,8.58" target="#b101">Slater, Smith, and Nair 2014)</ref>. But if this prediction is the result of a flawed model of the transition game, we need new or at least additional evidence. To test the conflictcentered view, we need an alternative measure based in a better theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capacity and the Class Struggle</head><p>An earlier tradition of mostly comparative and historical scholarship argued that democratization had its origins in a contest featuring elites (landlords and industrialists) and nonelites (peasants, workers, and perhaps the middle class). Granted, there was no unanimity about the shape that this struggle took. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,137.03,453.20,56.19,8.58" target="#b71">Moore (1966)</ref> identified the democratic path to the modern world with the bourgeois revolutions (famously, "no bourgeois, no democracy"). These transitions (the English, the French, and the American) had disparate origins-in England, the early commercialization of agriculture weakened the aristocracy; in France and the United States, landed upper classes were decimated by revolutions-but the different paths to democracy were paved by competition between the classes. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,75.86,547.60,3.00,4.58">5</ref> To be clear, this is not to argue that either believe the capacity of nonelites to threaten elites is irrelevant to the probability of democratization. The point is simply that they do not model this capacity. It is given from without (as the costs of repression in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,347.53,567.70,40.36,7.29" target="#b16">Boix [2003]</ref> and the costs of revolution in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,182.61,577.17,110.33,7.29" target="#b1">Acemoglu and Robinson [2006]</ref>). 6 "A group's likelihood of prevailing in conflict is proportional to the resources it holds" <ref type="bibr" coords="6,75.86,598.20,112.19,7.29">(Ansell and Samuels 2014, p. 71</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Democracy and the Class Struggle</head><p>Stephens (1989) criticized Moore for ignoring the role of nonelites in forging democracy, a criticism that would inspire the exemplary work of this tradition: <ref type="bibr" coords="7,128.35,117.17,112.41,8.58" target="#b96">Rueschemeyer et al.

By the modernization account, the developing world is less democratic simply because it is less developed. Both of the other endogenous accounts maintain that the issue is not the underdevelopment of these countries, but either concomitant patterns of inequality (see <ref type="bibr" coords="8,93.49,585.18,152.51,8.58">Ansell and Samuels 2014, pp. 17-35)</ref> or an unpropitious distribution of class capacities (weaker nonelites, stronger landlords).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Capacity Gap</head><p>Under what circumstances are dictatorships likely to become more democratic, or democracies likely to backslide toward authoritarianism? To answer this, we require an account of who is likely to demand democracy and who is not. The game-theoretic tradition has adopted several simplifying judgments about the factors that bear on democratic outcomes. It has focused on agents as defined by the economic assets they own. This has an a priori motivation, since the significance of democracy lies in the fact that it distributes political power equally in societies in which economic resources are unequal <ref type="bibr" coords="10,127.16,285.16,133.18,8.58">(Rueschemeyer et al. 1992, p. 44)</ref>. I follow their lead here. To be clear, the justification of these simplifications is empirical. They help derive testable hypotheses about the conditions under which we should see democratization or its reverse.</p><p>Consider a society of two types of actors: a tiny minority of elites, who command assets that they rely on to generate an outsized share of total income, and a large majority of nonelites, who are propertyless. 8 Nonelites rely on their capacity to work for a source of income. Because assets are scarce but the capacity to labor is plentiful, this income is inferior to that earned by elites. Last, assume a government that presides over this society, about which three facts are most important. First, this state is formally autonomous. The actors who administer the state have no a priori ties or allegiances. 9 Second, this state has no independent resource base. To pursue its own agenda, the 8 In this article I will refer to these groups as elites (below, industrial elites or landlords) and nonelites, rather than "the bourgeoisie" or "the working class." These latter terms are encumbered by the fact that they have been used differently by different authors. I will sometimes refer to the conflict between elites and nonelites as a class struggle, which implies no more than the fact that I have defined these groups by their relationship to economic assets. 9 While history suggests that elites often staff the offices of the state, there are two good reasons to assume that the state is staffed by extraeconomic actors. First, while state actors are drawn from the elite, most of the elite are not state actors. To understand why elites defend dictatorship, as I argue here, we must appreciate (1) the leverage that all elites have over the state and (2) the interests that all elites have in restricting nonelite access to the state, even if they are not state actors themselves. Second, as <ref type="bibr" coords="10,325.20,569.68,62.69,7.29" target="#b101">Slater et al. (2014)</ref> argue in a criticism of redistributivist models of the transition game, many 20th-century dictatorships were led by obviously autonomous actors (e.g., the military). I thank a reviewer for pushing me to clarify this point.</p><p>Democracy and the Class Struggle state depends on revenue drawn from taxing economic activity. Third, this state has the authority to affect the distribution of wealth, whether through tax-and-transfer policies or through regulating exchange between elites and nonelites. Naturally, elites and nonelites will clash over the direction of government policy. Crucially, their incentives to do so are indistinguishable. Nonelites want redistribution, but no more than elites hope to prevent it. However, while both sides have equal incentives, they do not have equivalent capacities. Why? Elite capacity is a feature of the property structure. This follows from the assumptions above. The state depends on a healthy economy to yield the revenues it requires. The health of the economy is a function of the health of investment, which means that it is determined first and foremost by the decisions of those who own the economy's commanding heights. If elites refuse to put their scarce assets to work, state revenues suffer greatly. Critically, the significance of this impact is a function of the scarcity of these assets. Substitutes for their assets are not readily available, which gives elites leverage over the state. As a consequence, when considering different policy options, the state will show deference to elites <ref type="bibr" coords="11,329.10,285.16,64.31,8.58" target="#b61">(Lindblom 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,85.89,297.18,17.88,8.58" target="#b61">(Lindblom , 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,109.36,297.18,41.92,8.58" target="#b79">Offe 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,152.34,297.18,70.42,8.58" target="#b86">Przeworski 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,223.88,297.18,97.87,8.58" target="#b20">Bowles and Gintis 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,322.87,297.18,52.57,8.58" target="#b109">Swank 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,376.56,297.18,15.98,8.58;11,85.89,309.20,38.10,8.58" target="#b120">Winters 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Nonelites, on the other hand, rely on an asset that is effectively universal, and for which substitutes are typically available. Withdrawing participation as an individual or as a small group is thus ineffective. Instead, nonelites exercise capacity in numbers. They seek to sway the state by means of collective action-by calling protests, organizing unions, forming parties, and more. They have to coordinate withdrawal from the everyday routines to which they are collectively indispensable and on which a healthy economy depends <ref type="bibr" coords="11,143.32,405.18,109.13,8.58" target="#b85">(Piven and Cloward 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,254.72,405.18,62.84,8.58" target="#b99">Schwartz 1988)</ref>. As with elites, the effectiveness of this action depends on the extent to which it threatens the resource base of the state.</p><p>Both elites and nonelites thus wield capacity in proportion to the amount of disruption they threaten, but the reasoning above has only established that elites and nonelites do this differently. Why might one side have an advantage? Capacities are uneven because achieving a fixed level of disruption is far easier for elites than for nonelites. Nonelite exit depends on the coordination of massive collective action, but elites can achieve the same level of disruption with far fewer participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Narrowing the Gap</head><p>This said, history furnishes innumerable examples of nonelites winning concessions from economic elites and the state. Why might the balance of capacities between elites and nonelites tilt in their favor? It is here that the dominant formalizations prove unhelpful. For Boix and Acemoglu and Robin-American Journal of Sociology son, nonelites acquire capacities for unpredictable reasons. For Ansell and Samuels, groups wield capacity in proportion to their resources, conventionally understood. Here I present my reasons for preferring an alternative. In the next section, I present evidence that this alternative explains patterns of nonelite organization and mobilization over the sweep of modern history.</p><p>I assume that the capacity of elites is stable. Where relative capacity varies, it does so because of shifts in the ability of nonelites to act collectively in disruptive ways. So, why might nonelite capacity vary?</p><p>Nonelite capacity varies because not every nonelite role has equivalent disruptive capacities. Consider at least two reasons that this might be the case. First, some nonelites have greater leverage over economic life.

Others have scarce skills or are located far afield from population centers, which means that elites will have trouble obtaining replacements <ref type="bibr" coords="12,165.77,273.20,69.47,8.58" target="#b56">(Kimeldorf 2013)</ref>. The refusal of nonelites to fill these roles inflicts greater costs than the refusal of other nonelites to fill theirs. Second, in some roles, nonelites find it easier to coordinate collective action. Some work in densely clustered workplaces, while others work alone or in small groups. Constant contact facilitates collective action. For these reasons, nonelite capacity (and by my earlier assumption, relative capacity) will vary with the distribution of nonelites into these differentially empowering roles.</p><p>When the discrepancy in the disruptive capacities of elites and nonelites is large, the state will be solicitous toward elites. However, as this gap narrows, the state's attentions will shift. The specifics are arbitrary: what is important is that the state's optimal strategy is less elite friendly than the maximally friendly one. And thus, as the gap narrows, so grows the influence of nonelites on the state. 10 This line of reasoning thus concludes in a familiar proposition: the balance of power shapes the balance of policy <ref type="bibr" coords="12,347.53,441.17,40.38,8.58;12,75.85,453.19,22.34,8.58" target="#b108">(Stephens 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,100.01,453.19,48.83,8.58" target="#b57">Korpi 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,150.64,453.19,96.78,8.58" target="#b34">Esping-Andersen 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,249.23,453.19,48.72,8.58" target="#b43">Hicks 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,299.69,453.19,53.03,8.58" target="#b59">Kristal 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,354.51,453.19,33.48,8.58;12,75.85,465.16,66.01,8.58" target="#b116">Volscho and Kelly 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,144.51,465.16,118.71,8.58;12,263.11,464.76,6.01,4.58">Hung and Thompson 2016). 11</ref> Democracy or Dictatorship?</p><p>Suppose that political authority can be organized democratically, where by democracy we mean that the state is subject to regular, competitive elections involving elites and nonelites alike. Elites will have incentives to oppose or obstruct democratization, and nonelites will have incentives to demand or safeguard it. This is because nonelites are numerous and elites a minority. All else equal, the extension of suffrage to propertyless nonelites should lead to less elite-friendly policy, since state actors interested in retaining their position now have to accommodate the preferences of nonelites. This does not mean that they are free to ignore elites, who still have control of scarce assets, and thus investment. It means only that democracy introduces important, countervailing pressures.</p><p>Thus, we can now ask, When are we likely to observe democratization or its reverse? Between equal incentives, capacity decides. I expect democratization to be associated with a narrowing of the capacity gap between elites and nonelites. Where nonelites accumulate capacity, we should see progress toward democracy. This insight-foundational to the social forces tradition, and based on priors that should be familiar to scholars of social movements and the welfare state-has been absent from the resurgent literature on democracy's origins. This article proposes to reintroduce it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Landed Elites</head><p>As mentioned earlier, the social forces tradition makes two predictions about democracy: first, that nonelites are the protagonists of the democratic transition, and second, that landlords are the antagonists. I have explained the hypothesis that stronger nonelites make democracy more likely, but what about landlords? Why should we expect them to be particularly keen defenders of dictatorship?</p><p>Until now I have assumed that elites are undifferentiated. Suppose, however, that some elites rely on land to generate their income and others rely on industrial and commercial property. By the reasoning above, democracy reduces the returns to all assets because it enhances the capacity of nonelites to sway the state (which regulates their use) and to bargain privately with elites.</p><p>However, not all assets will be affected in the same way. First, returns to land are particularly dependent on the willingness of the state to guarantee the structural facts are broadly correlated with organizational outcomes (see below), the foregoing can be considered a more abstract view of what those power resources actually entail.

For both of these reasons, landed elites are especially vulnerable to democratization, and they will therefore have strong incentives to oppose it. Note that nothing in this model predicts that elites not based in land will promote democracy. But countries in which power has shifted from the landed to the industrial elite should prove more amenable to democratization.</p></div>

Restricting the sample to these countries would limit us to units and time in which there is no substantial variation in the level of formal democracy. Thus, we need an alternative.

That is to say, all models include country fixed effects to account for unobserved country-level heterogeneity, year dummies to capture common time trends, and one or more lags of the dependent variable in order to capture dynamics. All samples are restricted to countries with 20 or more observations to mitigate Nickell's bias. 14 Strike frequency and volume are typically low, but some countries record some years in which strikes are frequent and/or very large. Disruptive capacity explains why the expected level of strike activity is higher in some years than in others, but it cannot, as a slow-moving series, explain these outlying years. This is reflected in the fact that these models generally fit the data less well than the models of union membership. It also helps explain why the implied change in strike frequency or volume is small, as a share of observed movements (i.e., the average within-country standard deviation is large, due to these outlying years).</p><p>American Journal of Sociology manufacturing share of GDP.

These estimates are standardized (i.e., divided by the average within-country standard deviation of the dependent variable and multiplied by the average within-country standard deviation of disruptive capacity). As expected, each of the three estimates is positive and statistically noteworthy at conventional levels (in the case of the union membership ratio, at a 5 0.10 in a twosided test). NOTE.-This table shows that my measure of nonelite capacity has two advantages. First, it is available in a far larger sample of countries and over a far longer period. Second, it is available in a substantially less biased sample (Δ Average Polity2 denotes the difference between the sample Polity2 average and the Polity2 average for all sovereign countries in the modern period) than are all other measures except for Potential Labor Power <ref type="bibr" coords="16,306.99,579.54,42.48,6.86" target="#b95">(Rudra 2002)</ref>, the Labor Rights Index <ref type="bibr" coords="16,122.85,589.01,78.99,6.86" target="#b74">(Mosley and Uno 2007)</ref>, and the manufacturing share of GDP <ref type="bibr" coords="16,339.99,589.01,47.87,6.86;16,75.85,598.53,51.15,6.86">(Haggard and Kaufman 2016)</ref>, all of which have inferior coverage.</p><p>Democracy and the Class Struggle racy data are also present (i.e., only 60% of the coverage of disruptive capacity). More importantly, table 1 shows that measures of mobilization and especially organization bias the sample, since they are much more likely to be available in democratic than authoritarian countries. Where data on the number of union members are available, the average democracy score is 42 points higher (on a 0-100 scale) than the average score in all countries and years for which data exist. Some bias is unavoidable, but table 1 shows that disruptive capacity minimizes this problem while maximizing coverage. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,337.32,176.76,6.01,4.58">15</ref> Second, more explicit measures of organization or mobilization raise the likelihood that the chosen measure is endogenous to the dependent variable or something closely associated with it. More democratic countries are likely to make it easier for workers to join unions or organize protests. My measure is not obviously exogenous, but the extent of any endogeneity bias is likely to be less severe.</p><p>Third, my measure has important theoretical advantages. As outlined earlier, where nonelites win democracy, this is because state administrators concede it when they realize that nonelites are capable of significant disruption. All else equal, this capacity should coincide with strikes and protests of which we have a record. But, sometimes, we might expect that concessions will be offered in anticipation of nonelite unrest, which will thus never transpire. Mobilization is thus only ever likely to be imperfectly related to capacity: strong nonelites might not need to mobilize, and weak nonelites may mobilize out of desperation. Thus, it makes sense to measure capacity rather than mobilization. And none of the other capacity measures identify the correct protagonists. <ref type="bibr" coords="17,158.97,381.20,54.03,8.58" target="#b95">Rudra (2002)</ref> proposes a measure rooted in the advantages of high-skill workers inside manufacturing, but this ignores the relatively high disruptive capacities of all manufacturing workers and workers in other sectors (mining, construction, and transport). <ref type="bibr" coords="17,258.86,417.20,123.71,8.58">Haggard and Kaufman (2016)</ref> use the share of manufacturing in GDP, but this has two problems: for gauging capacity, it is the wrong measure of significance (i.e., value-added rather than employment), and it again ignores the relative capacities of workers in other industries.</p><p>Finally, even if existing alternatives are unfeasible, my decision to approximate disruptive capacity by the share of the working-age population employed in traditionally disruptive industries raises a conceptual concern. Does variation in this index simply register economic development?

This is not my hypothesis, but one might worry that my index is testing their mech-15 Both Rudra's PLP and Mosley's Labor Rights Index are available in less biased samples than disruptive capacity but over a time period that is far too truncated to include in models of long-run democratization.</p><p>American Journal of Sociology anism rather than my own. However, note that the share of the workingage population employed in high-capacity industries is not a straightforward correlate of economic development. Over time in a single country, as is wellknown, the relationship is variable: positive at earlier levels of development and then negative at higher levels. There is also important cross-country variation. Recent work has shown that, in later developing countries, peak industrial employment occurs earlier on the development path and at lower levels of industrial employment than in earlier developers (what <ref type="bibr" coords="18,326.86,177.16,61.02,8.58">Rodrik [2016b]</ref> calls "premature deindustrialization"). In short, economic development does not yield equivalent disruptive capacities at all times or in all places. Of course, as with other variables that this literature has previously employed, disruptive capacity is imperfectly correlated with economic development ( r 5 0.62). I approach this difficulty conventionally, which is to say that I control for levels of development in the regressions I introduce later. My preferred models estimate the impact of disruptive capacity on democracy, conditional on the confounding consequences of GDP per capita. <ref type="bibr" coords="18,75.86,313.78,60.51,7.72">ESTIMATION</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables</head><p>As described, the principal contribution of this article is to propose a quantitative test of the social forces account-and, specifically, of the hypothesis that nonelite capacity drives democratic gains. To do so, I run panel regressions over the span of the modern history of democracy. As dependent variables, I use two continuous measures of the quality of a country's democracy. First, I use the 21-point Polity2 score, rescaled to lie between 0 and 100 in order to ease interpretation. It is derived from measures of six dimensions of a country's political state, which together evaluate executive recruitment, political participation, and checks on executive authority <ref type="bibr" coords="18,318.56,441.06,69.29,8.58;18,75.86,453.08,72.46,8.58" target="#b66">(Marshall, Gurr, and Jaggers 2014)</ref>. A score of 0 on my rescaled index (-10 on the original index) denotes a hereditary monarchy or its equivalent, and a score of 100 (110 on the original index) denotes full democracy. In 2014, only Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, North Korea, and Bhutan received the lowest score on this index, and there were 35 countries that received the highest. In all, data are available for 201 sovereign states, some as early as 1800. <ref type="table" coords="18,313.63,513.06,32.10,8.58" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows insample descriptive statistics for this and all other variables.</p><p>Reliable measurement of the level of democracy is no easy task. Some of the relevant properties are very difficult to quantify, especially since we seek consistency across long spans of time and an array of countries. The Polity IV project is a credible attempt to this end, but it has its critics <ref type="bibr" coords="18,312.03,573.10,75.96,8.58;18,75.85,585.06,80.46,8.58" target="#b23">(Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland 2010)</ref>. To ensure that my results are not sensitive to its measurement decisions, I also make use of an alternative measure from the Va-Democracy and the Class Struggle rieties of Democracy data set (hereafter V-Dem). V-Dem solicits answers to a wide range of evaluative questions from several thousand country experts and pools these responses via a model that accounts for differences in interpretation and reliability across coders <ref type="bibr" coords="19,243.78,345.02,91.62,8.58" target="#b25">(Coppedge et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="19,337.67,345.02,60.32,8.58;19,85.89,357.04,20.88,8.58" target="#b83">Pemstein et al. 2015)</ref>. This procedure yields estimates of the level of democracy in five different dimensions (as well as several subdimensional measures). In this analysis, I use the single measure in V-Dem that best captures overall progress in the prevalence of electoral democracy (v2x_polyarchy, hereafter Electoral Democracy).</p><p>As discussed already, my measure of nonelite capacity is a count of the total number of workers in manufacturing, mining, construction, and transport divided by the size of the working-age population. Data on the sectoral breakdown of the labor force comes from three sources. For the early period, I used the various volumes of Mitchell's International Historical Statistics <ref type="bibr" coords="19,85.89,477.01,58.86,8.58" target="#b70">(Mitchell 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="19,148.71,476.61,6.01,4.58">16</ref> For the post-World War II period, I updated and expanded coverage using two other data sets, one available via the International Labour Organization and the other curated by the Groningen Growth and Development Center <ref type="bibr" coords="19,138.31,513.00,150.87,8.58" target="#b113">(Timmer, de Vries, and de Vries 2014)</ref>. Both the Mitchell and International Labour Organization data sets sometimes report categories that straddle the high-capacity and low-capacity classifications (e.g., transport and commerce together). In these cases, I estimate the proportion of these composite categories that are high-capacity from the nearest observation for that country in which the relevant categories are reported separately. Otherwise, I considered the Groningen data set the most reliable and Mitchell's the least. Accordingly, if two or more data sets covered the same countryyear, I relied on them in this order. The working-age population is defined as those between the ages of 15 and 65. These data come from two sources. For the early period, Mitchell's International Historical Statistics collates population censuses and reports totals by age and gender. Occasionally, they report categories that straddle the working-age classification, in which case I proceed as above and estimate the proportion of these categories that are working-age by drawing information from the nearest observation in which no straddle categories are present. For the post-1960 period, annual and complete estimates are available through the United Nations.</p><p>The unconditional effect of disruptive capacity may partly capture the negative impact of the other half of the social forces account. I emulate Ansell and Samuels (2014) and estimate landlord capacity by the interaction of the percentage of farmland cultivated by family farms and the percentage of the population that lives on the land. Landlords should be most powerful where their chief asset is highly concentrated in their hands and where large numbers of people still depend on land for their livelihood. Both of these measures come from <ref type="bibr" coords="20,144.45,333.18,68.85,8.58" target="#b115">Vanhanen (2003)</ref>. To ease interpretation, I invert each measure (i.e., subtract the original by 100) and rescale their product to lie between 0 and 100. Low values of this index thus denote country-years in which few people live on the land and most land is in the hand of family farmers. High values of this index denote country-years in which most people live on the land and the distribution of land is skewed.</p><p>My main concern in this article is to demonstrate that these two variables help explain democratization, net of likely confounders, so in my preferred specification I include measures of the two other theories of endogenous democratization. I measure the modernization account in three ways. Most importantly, I control for a country's level of development. I measure this by the log of GDP per capita, which requires combining data from the Penn World Tables and Angus Maddison's long-run data set. From the same data, I calculated the logarithmic growth rate of GDP per capita, which I also include. This variable controls for the impact of antecedent growth rates on subsequent democratization-whether the rate of economic growth between time t 2 2 and t 2 1 affects a country's democracy score at time t. Separately, I include a measure of educational attainment. Whether because it incubates tolerance, or because it is a proxy for the growth of a middle class, higher levels of educational attainment should be associated with subsequent democratization <ref type="bibr" coords="20,181.02,573.16,117.70,8.58" target="#b76">(Murtin and Wacziarg 2014)</ref>.

Otherwise, modernization might matter because it clusters Democracy and the Class Struggle people into large cities. The growth of cities is an index of functional complexity, which some link to democratic government <ref type="bibr" coords="21,304.05,105.16,62.56,8.58" target="#b26">(Cutright 1963)</ref>. I thus include a measure of the proportion of a country's population that lives in cities with more than 100,000 residents <ref type="bibr" coords="21,249.22,129.19,102.81,8.58" target="#b10">(Banks and Wilson 2015)</ref>. Measurement of the inequality-centric account is more straightforward. As discussed already, the relationship between antecedent levels of inequality and subsequent democratization outcomes has been the subject of much recent research. Income inequality is the key variable in all leading models of the transition game. I followed <ref type="bibr" coords="21,200.19,189.18,107.82,8.58" target="#b8">Ansell and Samuels (2014)</ref>, and for the early period used Bourguignon and Morrisson's historical estimates of the income distribution <ref type="bibr" coords="21,136.69,213.16,142.84,8.58" target="#b19">(Bourguignon and Morrisson 2002)</ref>.

These longer interval samples defend against the possibility that results are muddied by the reverse causal relationship.

In the results I discuss, shortand long-run estimates yield the same conclusions. 18 By construction, the lagged dependent variable and the effective error term are correlated, which leads to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.

As <ref type="bibr" coords="25,137.71,337.20,95.43,8.58">Mahoney (2003, p. 148)</ref> argues, "It is fair to say that the weakening of landed elites is currently the most plausible explanation for why capitalist development is associated with . . . democracy in cross-national quantitative studies." The first of these findings is thus not particularly surprising, although its robustness bears mentioning. The negative long-run impact of landlord capacity is statistically significant at a 5 0.01 in the bivariate, social forces, and preferred specifications (cols. 2, 3, and 6 of tables 3 and 4). As figure 2 shows, this relationship holds whether we look 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 years into the future.</p><p>The second result, however, is novel. Quantitative work on democratization has not yet tested the hypothesis that nonelite capacity yields democracy, due either to theoretical confusion or to the absence of a credible measure of long-run disruptive capacity. This article has sought to fill that gap. The bivariate association of disruptive capacity with a country's subsequent Polity2 or Electoral Democracy score (col. 1) is unambiguous: the higher disruptive capacity moves above its country-specific mean, the higher a country' <ref type="figure" coords="25,393.59,517.20,4.27,8.58;26,328.17,580.68,7.29,14.71;26,328.17,547.22,2.08,31.22">s  FIG. 2.</ref>-This graph illustrates the statistical significance of all variables in my preferred specification, in samples of varying remove. The two panels correspond to the two different measures of democracy that I examine in this paper. The y-axis denotes the independent variable in question. The x-axis denotes the interval (in years) between observations. The purpose of this exercise is to see whether results survive at long remove (e.g., whether disruptive capacity at time t 2 10 predicts the Polity2 score at time t). If so, this is better (although not at all dispositive) evidence that the main associations I discuss are causal. Disruptive capacity is positively associated with subsequent levels of democracy at all except a 20-year remove.

Columns 3 and 6 of tables 3 and 4 show that this association is not obviously spurious-either when I control for just the capacity of landed elites or when I include all other variables. In fact, for both outcomes, when controlling for all likely confounders for which there are adequate data, the long-run estimate of disruptive capacity is larger and significant at a 5 0.01. As <ref type="figure" coords="27,183.23,152.38,31.19,10.00">figure 2</ref> shows, this is mostly true in the longer interval samples as well. Whether we look 1, 5, 10, or 15 years into the future, the long-run impact of disruptive capacity is positive and statistically significant (at a 5 0.05 in all but the 10-year Electoral Democracy sample, where it is significant at a 5 0.10). At 20 years, the estimate is still positive but statistically imprecise. These are my key results, and the second is new, so one might wonder whether they are robust to alternative estimation choices. I find that both results are statistically significant (at a 5 0.10, at least) when each specification is estimated on a consistent rather than unrestricted sample, when I vary the cutoff for the minimum number of nonmissing observations that must be present in a country to merit inclusion in the sample, when I use alternative measures of disruptive capacity, 22 when I add measures of involvement in war to the model, when I employ random rather than country fixed effects, or when I omit one country at a time (i.e., testing whether results were driven by an outlying country). Separately, I find no evidence that adding interactions between key variables changes any of the conclusions I draw. When I use dichotomous measures of democracy to model democratic transitions or consolidation rather than democratization, I find the class capacities matter as expected, except that the impact of disruptive capacity on consolidation, specifically, is quadratic rather than linear. Results do change if I omit either random or fixed effects or a lag of the dependent variable. In both cases, the effect of disruptive capacity on democracy is positive but no longer statistically significant. However, given the properties of these data, neither of these decisions is the right one. Countries in my sample are heterogeneous in ways that cannot be measured, and democracy is a strongly dynamic process. Thus, the omission of fixed or random effects or of a lag of the dependent variable invites bias.</p><p>How does the modernization account of democratization fare?

I find better evidence, however, for a different channel by which modernization is supposed to matter: not by raising average incomes, but by increasing the average level of education. This result is not statistically significant in models of the Polity2 score (or in col. 3 of either table, in which I only include the modernization variables), but the coefficient estimate is sizeable, and the same estimate is statistically significant (at a 5 0.05) in the model of Electoral Democracy. The result surfaces at 10 years' remove, too (in both models), although not in any other panel. If this estimate is correct, it suggests that, to the extent that development yields educational gains (but not income gains), it is associated with democratization. <ref type="bibr" coords="28,94.62,224.73,6.01,4.58">23</ref> What of the inequality-based account of democracy?

However the model is specified, or whether the association is examined at annual or extended remove, the impact of disruptive capacity (positive) and landlord power (negative) is unmistakable. Other explanations figure, but evidence of their importance is weaker. This said, the fact that these associations are statistically noteworthy is not proof of their political significance. How much do landlord power and disruptive capacity really matter? As noted already, the estimates presented in tables 3 and 4 are semistandardized, but the magnitudes are still not intuitive. How can one interpret a 4.1 increase in the Pol-ity2 score, or a 6-point decline in Electoral Democracy?</p><p>To better convey their political significance, I consider the impact of a substantively important change in these two key variables. My measures suggest that developing world nonelites have always been weaker than their developed world counterparts and landed elites stronger than theirs. This is not surprising, given what we know about the economic history of the developing world, but it invites a ready test of the significance of the social forces account. Had the developing world not been handicapped in this way, how much more democratic might it have been? By asking this question, I shed light on the puzzle posed earlier. By examining how much of the observed gap between the developed and developing world is closed under this counterfactual, I offer one estimate of how well the social forces account explains the authoritarian bent of the developing world's political history. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,385.91,372.75,6.01,4.58">24</ref> To aid interpretation, I present this counterfactual in two stages. 25 First, figure 3 plots this counterfactual trajectory in a single country, Brazil, and for only one of the two outcomes (Polity2). <ref type="bibr" coords="29,265.38,408.75,6.01,4.58">26</ref> In the main inset, the bottom line illustrates Brazil's predicted Polity2 score in the observed world.

In fact, this kind of counterfactual simulation assumes accurate inference. Its purpose is to aid interpretation. 25 Note that the difference between the counterfactual trajectory of democracy and its predicted trajectory (i.e., the estimated trajectory of democracy when independent variables are held at their observed values) registers two different magnitudes: (1) the coefficients associated with any independent variables that take different values under the counterfactual and (2) the difference between the counterfactual trajectory of any independent variables that I change and its observed trajectory. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,85.89,575.60,6.00,4.58">26</ref> Brazil makes for a useful representative case because data are widely available over the span of my panel, and its estimated fixed effect is very close to the sample median. Brazilian nonelites accumulated disruptive capacities on an advanced world pattern (the dotted line in the bottom left inset) and landlords lost power as they did in the average developed country (the dotted line in the bottom right inset). As is evident, the estimated consequences are significant: Brazil would have been considerably more democratic. The most intuitive way to summarize these gains is to quantify the area shaded in <ref type="figure" coords="31,279.95,152.38,29.49,10.00">figure 3</ref>. This area represents the additional years of democracy that Brazil would have enjoyed had its landed elites been weaker and its nonelites stronger. <ref type="bibr" coords="31,308.92,176.76,6.01,4.58">27</ref> In these terms, the shaded gains amount to about 46 democracy-years. This represents roughly an 83% improvement over its observed history, which is equivalent to observing that Brazil would have been close to twice as democratic. <ref type="bibr" coords="31,359.94,212.76,6.01,4.58">28</ref> Is Brazil idiosyncratic? <ref type="figure" coords="31,193.27,225.17,34.99,8.58">Figure 4</ref> plots the consequences of the same counterfactual across all developing countries and also extends the exercise to V-Dem's alternative measure. Gains are comparably significant. The average developing country gains around 29 democracy-years (Polity2), 29 which represents about a 54% improvement over the predicted trajectory in the observed world. 30 <ref type="figure" coords="31,162.26,285.16,35.67,8.58">Figure 4</ref> also makes it possible to estimate what this improvement represents, as a proportion of the gap between the developed and the advanced world. As the graph shows, at every point in the modern period, the developing world (the bottommost line) is less democratic than the developed world (the topmost). As before, I quantify this gap by calculating the area between the two curves, which suggests that the average developing country experiences around 49 fewer years of democracy (35 fewer, by V-Dem's measure). We can thus ask, How much of this gap is closed, in a counterfactual world in which all developing world elites and nonelites lost or gained capacities by developed world patterns? By this measure, around 57% of the gap between the advanced and developing worlds is explained by 27 These areas cannot be computed analytically, but there are several numerical methods that can substitute. I used Simpson's rule, which approximates the integral using quadratic polynomials over short intervals. 28 How much of this improvement is due to the strengthening of nonelites and how much to the weakening of landed elites? Results from these counterfactuals run separately suggest that about 63% are due to the early demise of landlords and about 37% to the earlier and more significant accumulation of disruptive capacity. <ref type="bibr" coords="31,85.89,509.61,6.00,4.58">29</ref> If the outcome is V-Dem's Electoral Democracy measure and not the Polity2 score, these numbers are 19 democracy-years and 52%, respectively.

Social scientists have long believed that this new epoch had something to do with the rise of capitalism, but the specific arguments have varied. One wing of this endogenous tradition argued that capitalist development mattered because of the class capacities it eroded and incubated-because it weakened landlords, democracy's most intransigent opponents, and strengthened nonelites, democracy's most committed partisans. Yet the existing scholarship that argues this point has been case study based, and its theoretical foundations have been largely ignored by recent quantitative work.</p><p>In this article, I made two main contributions. First, I reintroduced the social forces view into the contemporary debate by presenting a capacitycentered model of the democratic transition. Existing models of the transition game either assume away the capacities of social actors to win what they seek or they rely on an ingenuous account of collective action. I proposed a better model, which is centered on the concept of disruptive capacity. This helps explain why elites always have more power than nonelites, why the balance of power might shift with development, and why this shift leads to democracy. Second, I proposed the first long-run quantitative test of the social forces account. I gathered data on the composition of the labor force in almost 200 countries between the late 19th century and the present, which I used to construct an aggregate measure of nonelite disruptive capacity. This measure is not perfect, but barring significant progress in the theory and measurement of collective action, it is the best that students of crossnational democratization can do. I showed strong support for the hypothesis that nonelites drove democratization and confirmed existing wisdom that landlords imperiled it.</p><p>To be clear, it is not exactly correct to advertise my results as evidence that class capacities caused democratization. I have used this language as shorthand, but my results are consistent with two other explanations. It could be that countries on the verge of democratic transitions are more likely to adopt policies that cluster nonelites in high-capacity employment or that undermine landlords. In other words, democracy might explain capacity rather than capacity, democracy. The fact that antecedent levels of disruptive capacity predict democracy at a longer remove is encouraging, but this is not proof. Alternatively, it is possible that an omitted variable explains the coincidence of transition and antecedent capacity. <ref type="bibr" coords="33,275.81,540.16,91.04,8.58" target="#b2">Acemoglu et al. (2008)</ref> argued that both development and democracy were the consequence of antecedent institutional changes, which are thus the real cause. Note that the implications of this argument for the social forces account need not be dramatic. If the point is just that favorable institutional changes detonate capitalist de-American Journal of Sociology velopment, capacities may still be the proximate drivers of democratization. With no obvious way of capturing these institutional conjunctures quantitatively, I have to assume that they are residual to the patterns I explain. Nonetheless, partisans of the inferential revolution are correct to demand better. This is surely a fruitful area for future research.</p><p>Otherwise, future work might also explore improvements to the model of the transition game I proposed. Consider two. First, I assumed that nonelites always prefer democracy to dictatorship and that the intensity of these preferences is invariant. In my view, the incentive-centered accounts of democratization understate the benefits of democratization to nonelites, but assuming that they always demand democracy with equal intensity might make the opposite mistake. Of course, the measurement of incentives is an enormous challenge. Existing work uses measures of national-level inequality, which requires that we make heroic assumptions about what nonelites know about their relative well-being. 31 Second, I assumed that elite capacity was invariant. This allowed me to argue that nonelite disruptive capacity was the sole determinant of the balance of power, but this may not be realistic. My model assumed that elites exercise power through disinvestment (or exit), but there is a long tradition of scholarship that emphasizes explicit forms of organization (or voice). Future research might consider whether there is some way of capturing the facility with which elites organize.</p><p>As for the fate of democracy today, what can this article offer?

Future work might relax the typical assumption that the effect of all covariates is homogeneous; or, more ambitiously, it might synthesize and test explanations of why postco-31 That is to say, for the level of inequality to be a good proxy for nonelite incentives, nonelites should be aware of how unequal their country is relative to past years and even, depending on the specification, to other years in other countries. At least two facts about income inequality make this tricky. First, it does not usually vary very dramatically over time. Relying on this axis of variation requires believing that individuals discern movements of a few points in the Gini coefficient.

Optimistically, my results imply that these challenges are destined to be short-lived. The landlord class is dead, the citizenry are educated, and democracy reigns in their neighbors. Yet there may be grounds for pessimism too. The collapse of the labor movement has surely contributed to the oligarchic and populist flavor of present-day politics. The health of democracy may depend on that movement's ability to rebuild currently defunct class capacities.

NOTE.-This 
table reports the estimated long-run effects across the same six specifications shown in table 3, but when the dependent variable is the V-Dem mea-

sure of electoral democracy. My main 

findings are the same, and other 
findings are similar, which shows that my results are robust to considering an alternative 

measure of democracy.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">By their reasoning, nonelites seek full democracy (where they set policy), which can be achieved either by acting alone or by rebelling jointly with the bourgeoisie. They predict that only higher intersectoral inequality (i.e., a shift from land to industry) has unambiguous effects on nonelite action, but in their empirical work they acknowledge no way of measuring this dimension of the resource distribution (Ansell and Samuels 2014, p. 100).American Journal of Sociology</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="10">Why, if elites are always more capable of disruption than nonelites, should the state ever listen to nonelites? If the state is committed to minimizing disruption, why not attend only to the interests of elites? To establish that it must, I assume that the intensity of collective action is a function not just of existing capacities, but also of time spent acting collectively. The longer nonelites spend organizing against grievances that go unfulfilled, the more threatening their collective action is likely to be. Thus, for the state, ignoring the interests of nonelites risks greater disruption and perhaps calamity in the future. Minimizing disruption thus requires a middle-of-the-road strategy aimed at placating both elites and nonelites. 11 Power-resources theory is primarily concerned with explaining policy outcomes in advanced capitalist democracies, and its focus is on organizational and political rather than structural sources of actors' powerKorpi (2006, p. 187). This being said, to the extent that Democracy and the Class Struggle</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="20">Granted, reverse causation is just one threat to identification. Both variables may also covary with some time-varying unobserved variable. This strategy is no defense against that possibility. 21 Tables 3 and 4 include measures of fit, but because the samples are not consistent across specifications, the statistics cannot be compared.American Journal of Sociology</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="23">Of course, this approach gives us no ability to determine why: whether it is because educational attainment is an index of middle-class growth or because it incubates tolerance (or the second via the first, or both).</note>
