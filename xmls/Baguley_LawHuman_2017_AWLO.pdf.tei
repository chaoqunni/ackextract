<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Research consistently shows that techniques currently used to simplify jury instructions do not always improve mock jurors' comprehension. If improvements are observed, these are limited and overall comprehension remains low. It is unclear, however, why this occurs. It is possible that current simplification techniques do not effectively simplify the features of complexity, present in standardized instructions, which have the greatest effect on jurors' comprehension. It is not yet known, however, how much each feature of complexity individually affects jurors' comprehension. To investigate this, the authors used existing data from published empirical studies to examine how simplifying each feature of complexity affects mock jurors' application of instructions, as jurors can only apply instructions to the extent they understand them. The results suggest that reducing the conceptual complexity and proportion of supplementary information was associated with increased application of the instructions; however, reducing both the linguistic complexity and amount of information, and providing the instructions in a written format was not. In addition, results showed an unexpected adverse effect of simplificationreducing the amount of information was associated with an increase in the punitiveness of mock jurors' verdicts, independently of the instruction content. Together, these results suggest a need to make jury instructions comprehensible, highlight the key principles in the decision-process, and identify a way to eliminate the negative effect of reducing the amount of information. Addressing these needs is essential for developing a simplification technique that maximizes jurors' comprehension and application of instructions, while minimizing the previously overlooked negative effects of simplification.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can Jurors Comprehend Instructions?</head><p>Empirical research consistently shows that jurors have difficulty comprehending the key principles outlined in standardized instructions, including the legal concepts and the procedural rules that underlie the decision process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,174.90,209.04,75.70,7.91" target="#b67">Reifman et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.83,209.04,35.22,7.91;2,48.00,220.04,31.01,7.91" target="#b94">Wiener et al., 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,86.87,220.04,15.50,7.91">Wiener et al., , 2004</ref>. In fact, mock jurors typically only understand 50% to 70% of instructions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.79,231.04,110.25,7.91;2,48.00,242.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b4">Brewer, Harvey, &amp; Semmler, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,71.06,242.04,60.30,7.91" target="#b14">Ellsworth, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,133.91,242.04,72.15,7.91" target="#b15">Elwork et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,208.62,242.04,79.41,7.91" target="#b71">Rose &amp; Ogloff, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,253.04,98.26,7.91" target="#b76">Semmler &amp; Brewer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.44,253.04,99.76,7.91" target="#b78">Severance &amp; Loftus, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.38,253.04,35.67,7.91;2,48.00,264.04,62.12,7.91" target="#b89">Strawn &amp; Buchanan, 1976)</ref>. Although this variation in comprehension is partly due to the type of comprehension test employed (paraphrase or multiple-choice), the general conclusion about mock jurors' comprehension is that they do not understand standardized instructions. This is problematic because, if jurors cannot understand the instructions, they will rely on factors other than the instructions to decide their verdict. To understand why, we need to consider the dual process models of persuasion-the heuristic systematic model (HSM; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,78.47,352.04,58.71,7.91" target="#b5">Chaiken, 1980)</ref> and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,75.49,363.04,90.60,7.91" target="#b59">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>According to these models, people engage in different types of information processing to evaluate the quality of information, depending on their ability and motivation to engage in effortful processing. If people have the ability and motivation to engage in a high level of effortful processing, they will use systematic (HSM) or central (ELM) processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,185.43,429.04,59.03,7.91" target="#b5">(Chaiken, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.76,429.04,40.29,7.91;2,48.00,440.04,70.21,7.91" target="#b6">Chaiken &amp; Ledgerwood, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,120.19,440.04,83.68,7.91" target="#b59">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</ref>). This means they will carefully consider and scrutinize the content of the information, in order to evaluate its quality. However, if people do not have the ability and/or motivation to engage in a high level of effortful processing, they will use heuristic (HSM) or peripheral (ELM) processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.64,495.04,58.89,7.91" target="#b5">(Chaiken, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,151.69,495.04,114.68,7.91" target="#b6">Chaiken &amp; Ledgerwood, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,269.52,495.04,18.50,7.91;2,48.00,506.04,64.15,7.91" target="#b59">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</ref>). This means they will rely on mental shortcuts or heuristic cues, related to the information itself (e.g., the number of arguments presented) or the source of the information (e.g., expert's credentials), to evaluate the quality of the information, rather than relying on the content of the information.</p><p>Although various factors affect people's ability and motivation to engage in effortful processing, one factor that has been shown to reduce people's ability to engage in effortful processing is information complexity. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,138.91,594.03,127.82,7.91" target="#b9">Cooper, Bennett, and Sukel (1996)</ref> demonstrated that mock jurors who heard complex expert testimony with technical language were influenced by the expert's credentials. That is, they were more persuaded by the expert with strong credentials than weak credentials. This shows that mock jurors used the expert's credentials as a heuristic cue to evaluate the quality of their testimony. Importantly, however, mock jurors who heard simple expert testimony with nontechnical language were not influenced by the expert's credentials. Together, these findings suggest that reducing the complexity of information, to make it more comprehensible, reduces people's reliance on heuristic cues because they are better able to engage in effortful processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do Simplification Techniques Improve Jurors' Comprehension?</head><p>Researchers have attempted to simplify standardized instructions to improve jurors' comprehension. To date, four simplification techniques have been used-psycholinguistic simplification, providing factual examples of legal concepts, and providing either a written copy of the instructions or a decision-aid with and/or after the oral instructions. These techniques simplify some of the five primary features of complexity in standardized instructions that make the instructions difficult to understand; linguistic complexity, conceptual complexity, amount of information, proportion of supplementary information and presentation format.</p><p>The earliest technique used psycholinguistic simplification to enhance the readability of the instructions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,464.50,228.78,81.56,7.91;2,306.00,239.83,19.37,7.91" target="#b7">(Charrow &amp; Charrow, 1979)</ref>. This involves redrafting the instructions to use more common and familiar words; decrease lengthy compound sentences, passive sentences, and double negative terms; and logically organize paragraphs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,366.64,273.00,103.84,7.91" target="#b7">(Charrow &amp; Charrow, 1979)</ref>. The research comparing psycholinguistically simplified instructions to standardized instructions shows that this form of simplification can improve mock jurors' comprehension (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,436.47,306.17,74.43,7.91" target="#b17">Elwork et al., 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,514.21,306.17,31.82,7.91;2,306.00,317.23,49.05,7.91" target="#b82">Smith &amp; Haney, 2011)</ref>; however, improvements are not always observed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.54,328.29,138.90,7.91" target="#b64">Prager, Deckelbaum, &amp; Cutler, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,469.72,328.29,76.32,7.91;2,306.00,339.34,19.37,7.91" target="#b78">Severance &amp; Loftus, 1982)</ref>. Further, the magnitude of improvements in comprehension is limited and overall levels of comprehension for simplified instructions remains low. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,450.97,361.46,95.07,7.91" target="#b11">Diamond and Levi (1996)</ref> observed only a 15% improvement in comprehension for psycholinguistically simplified instructions, to an overall accuracy of just 65%. These findings provide some support for the beliefs among legal practitioners and judges-that the primary cause of poor comprehension of instructions is the complexity of legal concepts, which plain language cannot address <ref type="bibr" coords="2,442.49,427.79,103.54,7.91" target="#b7">(Charrow &amp; Charrow, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.00,438.85,202.88,7.91" target="#b56">Ogloff, Clough, Goodman-Delahunty, &amp; Young, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,511.96,438.85,34.08,7.91;2,306.00,449.91,42.62,7.91" target="#b58">Ogloff &amp; Rose, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Simplifying legal concepts in standardized instructions, however, is not straightforward-it is difficult to alter legal concepts without changing their legal meaning. In light of this, a newer simplification technique provides factual examples of legal concepts with the aim of making these concepts less abstract <ref type="bibr" coords="2,516.56,505.17,29.48,7.91;2,306.00,516.21,45.68,7.91" target="#b4">(Brewer et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,355.52,516.21,85.14,7.91" target="#b82">Smith &amp; Haney, 2011)</ref>. Compared to standardized instructions, this technique does not improve mock jurors' comprehension when factual, noncase-specific examples are used <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.00,549.35,79.38,7.91" target="#b4">(Brewer et al., 2004)</ref>. However, it does improve mock jurors' comprehension when factual, case-specific examples are used, provided the instructions are first redrafted using psycholinguistic simplification; although, improvements are limited and overall comprehension remains low <ref type="bibr" coords="2,411.97,593.53,85.60,7.91" target="#b82">(Smith &amp; Haney, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Other simplification techniques modify the presentation format. This involves providing jurors with either a written copy of the instructions or, more recently, a decision-aid-a pictorial flowchart or question-trail-with and/or after the oral instructions, which they then take into their deliberations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,518.83,648.76,27.20,7.91;2,306.00,659.81,104.49,7.91" target="#b13">Ede &amp; Goodman-Delahunty, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,416.25,659.81,78.76,7.91" target="#b64">Prager et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,500.77,659.81,45.26,7.91;2,306.00,670.85,50.52,7.91" target="#b76">Semmler &amp; Brewer, 2002)</ref>. Decision-aids extract the key issues the jury has to decide, state each issue as a question, arrange the issues in the order they need to be decided, and explicitly link jurors' decisions about these issues to a verdict. In doing so, decision-aids remove the supplementary information that would otherwise surround the This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>key issues in standardized instructions-including information that either restates or further explains these issues-to highlight the decision-process. This, in turn, reduces the amount of information in the instructions, which enables jurors to better attend to the instructions because they are less likely to become fatigued.

There is, however, mixed evidence for whether these techniques enhance jurors' comprehension.

First, simplifying instructions sometimes improves comprehension, but not always. Second, if improvements are observed, they are often limited. Third, overall comprehension remains low with simplified instructions. Together, these conclusions suggest that we do not yet have a simplification technique that effectively improves and maximizes jurors' comprehension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Next Steps for Simplification</head><p>To develop a simplification technique that effectively improves and maximizes jurors' comprehension and application of instructions, it is necessary to understand why current simplification techniques have limited success. It is possible that these techniques do not effectively simplify the features of complexity that have the greatest effect on jurors' comprehension. It is not currently known, however, how much each feature of complexity individually affects jurors' comprehension, for two reasons. First, most techniques simultaneously simplify multiple features of complexity. For instance, a decision-aid not only reduces the proportion of supplementary information and the total amount of information, it also provides the instructions in a written format. This makes it difficult to know which feature of complexity, when simplified, actually improves comprehension. Second, some techniques simultaneously simplify some features of complexity while inadvertently increasing the complexity of other features. For example, providing factual examples of legal concepts reduces the conceptual complexity, but also increases the amount of information. This increase in the amount of information may then negate the effect of reducing the conceptual complexity. It is therefore important to disentangle the features of complexity present in standardized instructions, and investigate how simplifying each feature of complexity individually affects jurors' comprehension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jurors' Application of Instructions</head><p>Although the immediate aim of simplifying standardized instructions is to improve jurors' comprehension, the secondary, and arguably more important aim is to increase jurors' application of instructions. Jurors can be said to apply the instructions when they use their understanding of the instructions to first, decide the issues in the trial, and second, decide a verdict. In this way, simplification should increase the extent to which jurors decide legally correct verdictsverdicts that correspond to their decisions about the issues, in the way outlined in the instructions. Research shows support for this. In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.00,194.04,67.11,7.91" target="#b17">Elwork et al. (1977)</ref>, mock jurors who received simplified instructions were more likely to decide legally correct verdicts, compared to mock jurors who received standardized instructions. Simplification, however, should not directly affect the punitiveness of jurors' verdicts, independent of the instruction content; a proposition that has consistently been supported in mock jury research <ref type="bibr" coords="3,469.60,249.04,76.44,7.91;3,306.00,260.04,19.80,7.91" target="#b2">(Bornstein &amp; Hamm, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,331.51,260.04,132.82,7.91" target="#b13">Ede &amp; Goodman-Delahunty, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,470.04,260.04,75.98,7.91;3,306.00,271.04,61.00,7.91" target="#b18">Essex &amp; Goodman-Delahunty, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,370.04,271.04,95.05,7.91" target="#b76">Semmler &amp; Brewer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,468.13,271.04,77.91,7.91;3,306.00,282.04,47.97,7.91" target="#b77">Severance, Greene, &amp; Loftus, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,357.44,282.04,102.21,7.91" target="#b79">Shaked-Schroer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,463.13,282.04,82.89,7.91" target="#b82">Smith &amp; Haney, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.00,293.04,68.96,7.91">Wiener et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Given the task of a juror is to apply the instructions to the evidence in the trial to decide their verdict, it is important to investigate how simplifying each feature of complexity individually affects jurors' application of the instructions, to facilitate drawing conclusions about how simplification affects jurors' comprehension. The approach of using jurors' application to infer comprehension is consistent with <ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.00,370.04,91.78,7.91" target="#b71">Rose and Ogloff's (2001)</ref> call to measure comprehension in a way that better reflects jurors' true comprehension. This approach, unlike traditional paraphrase and multiple-choice tests of comprehension, is less susceptible to underestimating or overestimating jurors' comprehension because it is less reliant on jurors' memory (Baguley, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,531.41,414.04,14.64,7.91;3,306.00,425.04,90.27,7.91">Mc-Kimmie, &amp; Masser, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,398.13,425.04,75.05,7.91" target="#b71">Rose &amp; Ogloff, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,475.04,425.04,70.99,7.91;3,306.00,436.04,18.64,7.91" target="#b78">Severance &amp; Loftus, 1982)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this benefit, however, it is important to remember that comprehending and applying the instructions are distinct cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,345.18,469.04,67.80,7.91" target="#b43">(Krathwohl, 2002)</ref>. That is, while comprehension is necessary for jurors to apply the instructions, it is not sufficient to ensure application occurs. According to McGuire's model of persuasion <ref type="bibr" coords="3,336.69,502.04,57.62,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,402.03,502.04,15.50,7.91" target="#b49">(McGuire, , 1972</ref>, there are six steps that need to occur for a person to be persuaded by information, with each step serving as a prerequisite to the next. Specifically, a person must be exposed to the information and attend to that information. Next, they must comprehend the information and then accept or agree with that information. They then have to remember the information and finally apply the information-that is, act in a way that is consistent with the information. This therefore means that if a juror applies the instructions we can infer that they comprehended them. However, if a juror does not apply the instructions, we cannot infer that they did not comprehend them. Rather they may have comprehended the instructions but failed to accept or remember them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>The aim of this study is to examine how simplifying each feature of complexity individually affects mock jurors' application of instructions. Even though application is traditionally conceptualized in terms of accuracy, through directly measuring legally correct verdicts, this is not possible within the context of this study, as only one study to date has measured legally correct verdicts <ref type="bibr" coords="3,435.30,715.04,107.03,7.91" target="#b17">(Elwork, Sales, &amp; Alfini, 1977)</ref>.

This measure, however, is not perfect. Although it can be used to infer mock jurors' lack of application, it cannot always be used to infer mock jurors' application. This is because mock jurors' verdicts can be consistent with the dominant focus of the instruction content, without them applying the instructions; for instance, when the evidence supporting a conviction or acquittal is strong. Despite this possibility, there are two reasons why this measure can be used in our study to infer mock jurors' application of instructions with a reasonable degree of confidence. First, our study averages mock jurors' verdicts across many studies with varying strengths of evidence. This means there will be no systematic effect of evidence strength. Second, this measure has previously been used in research to infer application. Specifically, it has been used in persuasion research to examine how the content of information influences people's attitudes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="4,90.37,264.04,133.11,7.91" target="#b60">Petty, Cacioppo, &amp; Schumann, 1983)</ref>.

That research specifically examines how the content of pretrial publicity and inadmissible evidence instructions-which tell jurors to ignore pretrial publicity and inadmissible evidence, respectively-influence mock jurors' verdicts.</p><p>To investigate how simplifying each feature of complexity individually affects mock jurors' application of instructions, 121 jury instructions, and their corresponding measure of verdict, were obtained from 75 published empirical studies. Each instruction was coded for each feature of complexity. The dominant focus of the instruction content was also coded. If simplification improves comprehension, and this in turn, increases mock jurors' application of the instructions, then mock jurors' verdicts should be consistent with the dominant focus of the instruction content, assuming they attend to, accept, and remember the instructions <ref type="bibr" coords="4,90.70,451.04,54.61,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,151.86,451.04,14.91,7.91" target="#b49">(McGuire, , 1972</ref>.</p><p>In the context of simplifying each feature of complexity, we therefore predicted that an increase in the dominant focus of the instruction content, toward mostly on conviction, will be associated with an increase in verdict punitiveness (H1); however, this would occur to a greater extent at lower levels of complexity, compared to higher levels of complexity (H2). Specifically, this will occur for lower levels of linguistic complexity and conceptual complexity (compared to higher levels of linguistic and conceptual complexity), for lower proportions of supplementary information (compared to higher proportions of supplementary information), for smaller amounts of information (compared to larger amounts of information) and for instructions that are provided in a combined oral and written format (compared to an oral format), or a written format (compared to an oral format).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion</head><p>A jury instruction from a study was included if the following three conditions were met. First, the study provided a copy of the instruction. Second, the instruction described the process to evaluate the evidence and decide a verdict. Consequently, an instruction was not included if it only provided information about the consequences for a defendant postverdict or an admonition to decide a unanimous verdict for a deadlocked jury (dynamite charge). Third, a measure of verdict punitiveness (either as a percentage or mean) was provided for the instruction. An instruction was subsequently excluded if the instruction was less than 19 words, only contained one sentence, or was presented as a flowchart, because we could not code the features of complexity (described below). An instruction was also excluded if it did not state the number of participants who provided the verdict punitiveness measure, because we could not weight the data for our analyses.</p><p>An independent instruction was defined as an instruction presented in a single format (e.g., oral, written or combined oral and written). Therefore, if two studies presented the same instruction in the same format, the instruction was only coded as one independent instruction; however, if two studies presented the same instruction in a different format, the instruction was coded as two independent instructions. The final sample included 121 independent instructions (see <ref type="table" coords="4,388.81,434.95,27.85,7.91" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) from 63 articles, 75 studies, and 12,184 participants (72.04% university students; 27.96% community members). The independent instructions included 48 substantive instructions (instructions about offenses and defenses; e.g., murder and insanity), 30 procedural instructions (instructions about general trial procedures; e.g., the standard of proof), and 43 evidentiary instructions (instructions about particular pieces of evidence; e.g., eyewitness evidence; Victorian Law Reform Commission, 2009). The instructions were used in both civil (n ϭ 23) and criminal (n ϭ 98) trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding the Features of Complexity</head><p>Each instruction was coded on five features of complexity: linguistic complexity, conceptual complexity, amount of information, proportion of supplementary information and presentation format. Appendices A, B, and C provide an example of this coding for a substantive, procedural, and evidentiary instruction.</p><p>Linguistic complexity. Pearson's online text analysis tool (http://readingmaturity.com/) was used to provide the Reading Maturity Metric (RMM; Landauer, 2011) for each retained instruction. The RMM is a text complexity measure calculated using the linguistic features in the instruction: word frequency, syntax and semantic coherence. It aligns the instruction to the school or college grade required to read and understand the text (https:// lexile.com/using-lexile/lexile-measures-and-the-ccssi/the-common-This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.

The RMM is more accurate than previous measures of text complexity (e.g., the Flesch-Kincaid Grade-Level), because it takes into account how meanings of words change with reading experience <ref type="bibr" coords="10,175.80,561.04,63.68,7.91" target="#b44">(Landauer, 2011)</ref>. Using this measure, a higher RMM indicated a higher level of linguistic complexity. The RMM across the instructions ranged from 6.20 to 14.00 (median ϭ 12.92, M ϭ 12.42, SD ϭ 1.52; skewness ϭ Ϫ1.06, SE skewness ϭ 0.22; kurtosis ϭ 0.86, SE kurtosis ϭ 0.44). 1 The grade required to read and understand the instructions ranged from Grade 9 to college graduate. Conceptual complexity. The independent concepts within each instruction were identified. A concept was defined as a definable term or phrase used in a legal context to tell jurors what something is or means. Example concepts included insanity, burden of proof, and preponderance of evidence (see Appendices A and B). For each instruction, the number of concepts in the instruction was coded. The number of components used to define each concept was also coded. For instance, if the concept of murder was defined as "when a person causes the death of another and intends to cause their death," two components were coded: causes death and intends to cause death. The total number of concepts and components for each instruction was then calculated.</p><p>Two legally trained coders (Author 1 and an independent coder) individually identified the independent concepts across all instructions. Both coders identified 82.50% of the same concepts. The concepts only identified by one coder were discussed, and an agreement between the coders was reached as to whether each was a concept. Using these identified concepts, Author 1 coded the number of concepts in each instruction. Both coders then coded the 1 Consistent with our analyses, the descriptive statistics provided for each feature of complexity are weighted-each instruction was weighted by the total sample size for the studies that provided a measure of verdict punitiveness for that instruction. A higher RMM indicates a higher level of complexity. c The average number of components used to define a concept in an instruction. A higher average number of components per concept indicates a higher level of complexity. d The number of words used to outline the instruction. A greater number of words indicates a higher level of complexity. e The percentage of words used to outline the supplementary information in the instruction. A higher percentage indicates a higher level of complexity. f Either oral, written or combined oral and written.

A higher percentage indicates more punitive verdicts.</p><p>This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Both coders coded the same number of components for 88.70% of the defined concepts. The average number of components per concept in an instruction was calculated by dividing the number of components by the number of concepts, as it was assumed that concepts are more complex when more components are used to define them. Although some concepts may be complex because they are undefined, and therefore vague (e.g., reasonable doubt; <ref type="bibr" coords="11,245.49,166.59,42.57,7.91;11,48.00,177.78,19.37,7.91" target="#b40">Kerr et al., 1976)</ref>, these concepts are generally undefined because defining them does not make the concept clearer to a jury <ref type="bibr" coords="11,223.45,188.98,60.71,7.91" target="#b35">(Horowitz, 1997)</ref>. Therefore, a higher average number of components per concept indicated a higher level of conceptual complexity. The average number of components per concept across the instructions ranged from 0 to 7 (median ϭ 1.33, M ϭ 1.44, SD ϭ 1.17; skewness ϭ 0.76, SE skewness ϭ 0.22; kurtosis ϭ 1.17, SE kurtosis ϭ 0.44). 2 Amount of information. For each instruction, the total number of words used to outline the instruction was calculated. Using this measure, a greater number of words indicated a higher level of complexity, because a larger amount of information meant jurors had to attend to the instructions for a longer period of time. The total number of words across the instructions ranged from 35 to 936 (median ϭ 162.01, M ϭ 245.22, SD ϭ 223.13; skewness ϭ 1.34, SE skewness ϭ 0.22; kurtosis ϭ 1.00, SE kurtosis ϭ 0.44).</p><p>Proportion of supplementary information. For each instruction, the independent key principles in the instruction were identified. An independent key principle was defined as any statement that directly described the process to evaluate the evidence and decide a verdict. The information not identified as independent key principles was classified as supplementary information. This included, for instance, information that summarized the trial (see Appendix C), further explained the key principles (through providing factual examples of the key principles or statements about why the key principle is provided; see Appendices A and C), or reinforced the key principles (through restating the key principles; see Appendix B). The total number of words used to outline the supplementary information was then calculated. This total was converted to a percentage-the number of words used to describe the supplementary information was divided by the total number of words in the instruction, and multiplied by 100.</p><p>Two legally trained coders (Author 1 and an independent coder) individually evaluated each instruction. There was a high correlation between the coders for the percentage of words used to describe the supplementary information in the instructions, r ϭ .81, p ϭ .000, and there was no significant difference between the coders' average percentage of words used to outline the supplementary information across the instructions (M ϭ 26.37, SD ϭ 18.05; M ϭ 27.22, SD ϭ 19.79), t(120) ϭ Ϫ0.78, p ϭ .435, 95% confidence interval (CI) [Ϫ2.99, 1.29], 2 ϭ .01. Given the high agreement between both coders, Author 1's coding was used in the analyses.</p><p>We assumed the key principles would be harder to identify as the proportion of supplementary information increased. Therefore, a higher percentage of words used to describe the supplementary information indicated a higher level of complexity. The percentage of words to describe the supplementary information across the instructions ranged from 0% to 68.42% (median ϭ 25.40, M ϭ 27.27, SD ϭ 18.13; skewness ϭ 0.16, SE skewness ϭ 0.22; kurtosis ϭ Ϫ0.71, SE kurtosis ϭ 0.44).</p><p>Presentation format. Each instruction was coded based on how the instruction was presented to jurors in the original published study: an oral format (n ϭ 50), a written format (n ϭ 47) or a combined oral and written format (n ϭ 24). Compared to instructions presented in either a written format or a combined oral and written format, instructions presented in an oral format do not provide jurors with the opportunity to read the instructions at their own pace, consistent with their rate of learning. Instructions presented in an oral format therefore indicated a higher level of complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding the Dominant Focus of the Instruction Content</head><p>Given the instructions outline the process juries should follow to evaluate the evidence of the defense and prosecution, the dominant focus of the instruction content was evaluated on a 3-point continuous semantic differential scale, from Ϫ1 (mostly on acquittal) to ϩ 1 (mostly on conviction). For the dominant focus of the instruction content to be coded as mostly on conviction, substantive instructions had to describe the factors jurors had to consider for an offense (e.g., murder) to be proved, evidentiary instructions had to either direct jurors to act in a way that favored the plaintiff/prosecution (e.g., cannot nullify the law in a murder trial when they sympathize with the defendant) or tell jurors to be cautious when evaluating the defense's evidence (e.g., eyewitness for defense), and procedural instructions had to define a lower standard of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence) to prove an offense. For the dominant focus of the instruction content to be coded as mostly on acquittal, substantive instructions had to describe the factors jurors had to consider for a defense (e.g., insanity) to be proved, evidentiary instructions had to either direct jurors to act in a way that favored the defense (e.g., can nullify the law in a murder trial when they sympathize with the defendant) or tell jurors to be cautious when evaluating the plaintiff's/prosecution's evidence (e.g., eyewitness for plaintiff/prosecution), and procedural instructions had to define a higher standard of proof (e.g., reasonable doubt) to prove an offense.</p><p>Two legally trained coders (Author 1 and an independent coder) individually evaluated each instruction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding Verdict Punitiveness</head><p>Verdict punitiveness was coded as a percentage for the verdict options favoring the plaintiff/prosecution (e.g., guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter). Mean levels of guilt were converted into percentages by dividing the mean by the highest score on the guilt likelihood scale and multiplying this score by 100. If the lowest score on the guilt likelihood scale was not 0, then both the scale and mean were first recoded, so the lowest score on the scale was 0. For each instruction, verdict punitiveness was calculated by averaging the percentage of verdicts provided in each study that used the instruction. The percentage of verdicts ranged from 7.69% to 100.00% (median ϭ 49.00, M ϭ 50.08, SD ϭ 19.48; skewness ϭ 0.51, SE skewness ϭ 0.22; kurtosis ϭ 0.32, SE kurtosis ϭ 0.44).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of this study was to examine how simplifying each feature of complexity individually affects mock jurors' application of instructions. For each feature of complexity, we predicted that an increase in the dominant focus of the instruction content, toward mostly on conviction, would be associated with an increase in verdict punitiveness (H1); however, this would occur to a greater extent at lower levels of complexity, compared to higher levels of complexity (H2). Our results supported H1 and partially supported H2-specifically; for conceptual complexity and proportion of supplementary information, but not for linguistic complexity, amount of information and presentation format (oral vs. combined oral and written). Further, for presentation format (oral vs. written), our results contradicted our hypothesis (H2)-an increase in the dominant focus of the instruction content, toward mostly on conviction, was associated with an increase in verdict punitiveness when the instructions were provided in an oral format, but not a written format. Finally, and unexpectedly, our results also showed that reducing the amount of information was associated with an increase in verdict punitiveness, independently of the dominant focus of the instruction content.</p><p>Our results suggest that reducing the conceptual complexity, but not the linguistic complexity, and reducing the proportion of supplementary information, is associated with increased application of the instructions because mock jurors' verdicts were consistent with the dominant focus of the instruction content for lower levels of conceptual complexity and lower proportions of supplementary information, but not for higher levels of conceptual complexity and higher proportions of supplementary information. The fact that mock jurors did not rely on the instructions to decide their verdict when the instructions were more complex is not surprising, as research shows that mock jurors will be persuaded by factors other than the content of a message, when the message is complex (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,326.35,378.26,69.69,7.91" target="#b9">Cooper et al., 1996)</ref>.

This may explain why psycholinguistic simplification only results in small, if any, improvements in comprehension, and why overall comprehension with this form of simplification remains low (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,306.00,546.68,88.90,7.91" target="#b11">Diamond &amp; Levi, 1996)</ref>. Despite the difficulty of doing so, this study strongly suggests a need to find a way to effectively simplify legal concepts. Although providing factual examples of legal concepts shows promise as a technique to reduce this complexity and improve jurors' comprehension, it has yet to maximize mock jurors' comprehension <ref type="bibr" coords="13,390.97,602.81,85.60,7.91" target="#b82">(Smith &amp; Haney, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our results also provide strong support for using decision-aids in trials. Although not widely used in courts to date, reducing the proportion of supplementary information surrounding the key principles appears to have clear benefits for jurors' comprehension and application of the instructions. It may be the presence of supplementary information that explains why comprehension remains low for other simplification techniques, including psycholinguistic simplification (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,349.95,692.61,84.33,7.91" target="#b11">Diamond &amp; Levi, 1996)</ref>, providing factual examples of legal concepts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,378.81,703.83,81.36,7.91" target="#b82">Smith &amp; Haney, 2011)</ref> and providing a written copy of the instructions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,416.55,715.04,95.68,7.91" target="#b76">Semmler &amp; Brewer, 2002)</ref>.

This is surprising and it suggests there may be other factors inhibiting the benefit of reducing the proportion of supplementary information from always being realized. Our results with regard to presentation format may help to identify what this factor may be. Interestingly, the results of our analysis of presentation format suggest that altering the presentation format to reduce complexity, by presenting the instructions in a combined oral and written format, is not associated with increased application of the instructions because mock jurors' verdicts were consistent with the dominant focus of the instruction content to the same extent for instructions presented in a combined oral and written format and instructions presented in an oral format. Consistent with the extant research, this result suggests that reducing complexity, through providing a written copy of the instructions, is not associated with improvements in comprehension beyond the levels achieved from only listening to the instructions <ref type="bibr" coords="14,425.41,121.81,86.67,7.91" target="#b27">(Greene &amp; Johns, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,514.56,121.81,31.47,7.91;14,306.00,133.01,50.70,7.91" target="#b30">Heuer &amp; Penrod, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,359.16,133.01,68.86,7.91" target="#b64">Prager et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,430.48,133.01,75.23,7.91" target="#b67">Reifman et al., 1992)</ref>. Although this conclusion might suggest there is no benefit of self-paced reading, it is also possible that mock jurors did not thoroughly read the written instructions-they were either not motivated to thoroughly read the instructions, or they were not able to thoroughly read the instructions because they were not proficient readers. A lack of motivation perhaps provides a more plausible explanation given 72.04% of mock jurors were university students, who are typically presumed to have a high level of reading proficiency.</p><p>Research supports this differential reading explanation-mock jurors only referred to written instructions for a minimal amount of time or not at all during deliberations, when the instructions were provided as either a written copy of the oral instructions <ref type="bibr" coords="14,481.27,267.33,64.79,7.91;14,306.00,278.52,20.29,7.91" target="#b30">(Heuer &amp; Penrod, 1989)</ref> or a decision-aid <ref type="bibr" coords="14,390.43,278.52,49.34,7.91" target="#b55">(Ogloff, 1998)</ref>, respectively. In fact, there is also support for this differential reading explanation in our results comparing instructions presented in an oral format to instructions presented in a written format-mock jurors' verdicts were consistent with the dominant focus of the instruction content when mock jurors received the instructions in an oral format, but not when mock jurors received the instructions in a written format. If mock jurors had thoroughly read the written instructions, their verdicts should have been consistent with the dominant focus of the instruction content to the same extent as oral instructions (where mock jurors heard all the instructions), even if there was no benefit of self-paced reading.</p><p>Together, our presentation format findings can be used to reconcile the inconsistent findings observed in prior research. In studies where the instruction was provided in a written format, either as a written copy of the instruction or a decision-aid and mock jurors' comprehension did not improve or only improved to a limited extent, it is likely that mock jurors did not thoroughly read the written instructions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,433.65,468.63,112.41,7.91;14,306.00,479.81,20.50,7.91" target="#b18">Essex &amp; Goodman-Delahunty, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,328.96,479.81,83.62,7.91" target="#b27">Greene &amp; Johns, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,415.04,479.81,70.73,7.91">Wiener et al., 2004)</ref>. This meant the written instructions could not benefit comprehension because mock jurors did not carefully attend to the instructions, thus omitting the necessary step for comprehension in McGuire's model of persuasion <ref type="bibr" coords="14,388.39,524.54,58.57,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,455.64,524.54,15.50,7.91" target="#b49">(McGuire, , 1972</ref>.

In saying this, research on persuasion suggests two factors that may be relevant, because they affect motivation to engage in effortful processing: the extent to which jurors feel either personally responsible for their decision or accountable for their decisionmaking process <ref type="bibr" coords="15,107.51,484.04,128.28,7.91" target="#b61">(Petty, Harkins, &amp; Williams, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,238.55,484.04,49.50,7.91;15,48.00,495.04,150.87,7.91" target="#b74">Scholten, van Knippenberg, Nijstad, &amp; De Dreu, 2007)</ref>. Even though it is premature to draw conclusions about the extent to which written instructions improve comprehension when read thoroughly, these results provide important insight into jurors' potential lack of thoroughness in reading written instructions. This, of itself, is a critical finding; one that suggests a future direction for research to explore in order to improve the quality of jury decision-making.</p><p>Surprisingly, our results suggest that reducing the amount of information was not associated with increased application of the instructions because mock jurors' verdicts were consistent with the dominant focus of the instruction content to the same extent for instructions containing both a smaller and larger amount of information. Drawing on McGuire's model of persuasion <ref type="bibr" coords="15,250.31,627.04,37.73,7.91;15,48.00,638.04,16.20,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,70.48,638.04,15.50,7.91" target="#b49">(McGuire, , 1972</ref>, this suggests that reducing the amount of information did not improve mock jurors' attention to the instructions, nor did it improve their memory of the instructions. Although both these conclusions seem counterintuitive, it is possible that the proposed detrimental effect of fatigue on attention and the additional detrimental effect on memory did not occur because the instructions analyzed in this study, obtained from mock trials, did not contain enough information to induce fatigue and impair memory. As a result, reducing the amount of information had no effect. This explanation seems plausible, as the longest instruction in this study only contained 936 words, or approximately 6 minutes of listening. However, it is possible that inattention, due to fatigue, and impaired memory does occur in real trials, given jurors listen to instructions for an average of 103 minutes in a 5-day trial and 272 minutes in a 20-day trial <ref type="bibr" coords="15,400.22,143.03,72.99,7.91" target="#b56">(Ogloff et al., 2006)</ref>. If this is the case, reducing the amount of information in real trials may affect both jurors' comprehension and application of the instructions.</p><p>Although it is not yet possible to definitively conclude that reducing the amount of information is not associated with improved comprehension and increased application of the instructions, examining the effect of reducing the amount of information in this study was important. It not only suggests that this effect may be contingent on the amount of information provided, it also revealed an unintentional, and previously overlooked, negative effect of simplification-reducing the amount of information is associated with increased verdict punitiveness, independently of the dominant focus of the instruction content. One possible explanation for this may involve jurors' subjective experiences of the instructions; jurors may feel less doubt and more confidence about deciding a verdict when they have to consider less information. In fact, the findings of <ref type="bibr" coords="15,389.88,319.03,99.58,7.91" target="#b31">Heuer and Penrod (1994)</ref> provide some support for this-mock jurors reported less difficulty deciding a verdict as the quantity of information in the trial decreased. Jurors may then be more likely to attain the confidence required to decide a more punitive verdict. Regardless of the reason, this result raises serious concerns for upholding the principles of fair process that underlie the judicial system, as simplifying instructions should not directly affect the punitiveness of verdicts, independently of the instruction content (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,404.27,407.03,141.77,7.91" target="#b18">Essex &amp; Goodman-Delahunty, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,306.00,418.03,83.96,7.91" target="#b77">Severance et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,392.95,418.03,72.34,7.91">Wiener et al., 2004)</ref>.    <ref type="figure" coords="15,306.00,695.78,27.45,6.86">Figure 3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations</head><p>This study deconstructed current simplification techniques to provide a critical insight into how simplifying each feature of complexity, present in standardized instructions, individually affects jurors' application of the instructions to decide their verdict. This, in turn, enabled us to infer how simplifying each feature of complexity individually affects jurors' comprehension, without encountering the estimation problems associated with relying on traditional paraphrase and multiple-choice tests of comprehension. By showing that reducing only some features of complexity was associated with enhanced comprehension and application of the instructions, this study allowed us to better understand why current simplification techniques are ineffective in improving and maximizing jurors' comprehension. Drawing on McGuire's model of persuasion <ref type="bibr" coords="16,89.47,239.11,56.91,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,153.42,239.11,15.50,7.91" target="#b49">(McGuire, , 1972</ref>, to explain why some features of complexity are not associated with enhanced comprehension and application of the instructions, we were able to broaden the scope of current discussions in this area. Finally, our study also highlighted a negative effect of simplification; an important outcome that has been overlooked in the research to date.</p><p>Although our study is informative about written instructions not being associated with enhanced comprehension and application of the instructions, we are unable to conclude whether this is because there is no benefit of self-paced reading or because jurors do not thoroughly read written instructions. While our differential reading explanation seems plausible, future research should investigate whether written instructions, provided alone, with or after oral instructions, improve jurors' comprehension and application of the instructions when jurors thoroughly read them. Ensuring jurors attend to the instructions in this way will allow us to demonstrate the true value of providing jurors with the opportunity to read the instructions at their own pace, consistent with their rate of learning. This is important, given the growing trend for law reform commissions to recommend providing jurors with written instructions as a way of improving comprehension (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,238.51,460.48,49.52,7.91;16,48.00,471.55,119.60,7.91">New Zealand Law Reform Commission, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Although this analysis is an important first step in investigating whether reducing the amount of information is associated with improved comprehension and increased application of the instructions, our conclusions are limited because the instructions provided in mock trials may not have contained a large enough amount of information to induce fatigue and impair memory. Future research should therefore independently investigate these effects when a substantial amount of information is provided. This may involve having jurors attend to the instructions for 60 to 90 minutes-a period of time that jurors would reasonably be expected to attend to the instructions in a trial, before being able to take a break-and then asking them to recall those instructions. Disentangling the effects of inattention on comprehension and impaired memory on application will inevitably be a challenge. However, doing so is necessary to draw definitive conclusions about whether or not simplifying the amount of information improves jurors' comprehension and application of the instructions, and why this is the case, in the context of McGuire's model of persuasion <ref type="bibr" coords="16,250.32,670.77,37.73,7.91;16,48.00,681.84,16.20,7.91" target="#b48">(McGuire, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,71.20,681.84,15.50,7.91" target="#b49">(McGuire, , 1972</ref>. It will also provide important information about the upper limit for jurors' attention to and memory of the instructions, before the effects of fatigue and impaired memory, if any, are observed.</p><p>Once we better understand how the cognitive processes of attention and memory affect jurors' comprehension and application of the instructions, future research should then draw upon the persuasion literature to examine what factors affect whether jurors attend to and remember the instructions. Future research should also examine both the role of acceptance on jurors' comprehension and application of the instructions, and the factors that affect this, in the context of standardized instructions that form the basis of instruction simplification research. This is necessary to know how to adapt current trial processes in a way that will enhance jurors' comprehension and application of the instructions.</p><p>Finally, future research should investigate the reason why reducing the amount of information was associated with increased verdict punitiveness. Although we have suggested this may have occurred because less information increases jurors' confidence about deciding a verdict, more research is required to confirm this is the case. Understanding this reason is essential for developing a way to overcome this detrimental effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The results of our analysis have important implications for developing a simplification technique that effectively improves and maximizes jurors' comprehension, and subsequent application of instructions. First, our results suggest the need to make the instructions comprehensible, through reducing the conceptual complexity, and to highlight the key principles in the decisionprocess, through reducing the proportion of supplementary information surrounding the key principles. This may involve providing case-specific facts to convey the legal concepts in a framework similar to decision-aids. Second, our results emphasize the need to ensure jurors thoroughly read written instructions if these are provided. This may involve providing jurors with a decision-aid, which they are required to use to decide their verdict. This could be similar to a Special Verdict Form, where jurors have to provide the judge with written responses about their decisions for each issue in the trial <ref type="bibr" coords="16,373.30,473.04,61.94,7.91" target="#b19">(Faulkner, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,439.45,473.04,102.72,7.91" target="#b97">Wiggins &amp; Breckler, 1990)</ref>. Finally, our results suggest that it is necessary to identify a way to eliminate the negative effects of reducing the amount of information on the punitiveness of jurors' verdicts. Using Special Verdict Forms may also be useful in this regard-they would ensure jurors decide their verdicts using the content of the instructions, rather than their subjective experiences.</p><p>Our results also have important implications for designing research on jurors' comprehension and application of instructions in the future. This research should incorporate tests of jurors' attention, acceptance, and memory of instructions, in addition to tests of their comprehension and application of instructions. It is only through examining these additional cognitive processes that we can further advance our current knowledge about why current simplification techniques have had limited success in improving and maximizing jurors' comprehension and application of instructions.</p></div>

Our study shows support for this perspective, but only when simplifying certain features of complexity. In addition, our analysis also shows that simplifying certain features of complexity unintentionally and adversely affects the punitiveness of jurors' verdicts. Recognizing that instruction simplification is not straightforward or universally beneficial is a necessary step for advancing current simplification techniques. Identifying a simplification technique that maximizes the positive effects of simplification, while minimizing the negative effects of simplification, will ultimately enhance the quality of jury decisions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1" coords="14,48.00,311.20,240.02,7.03;14,48.00,321.20,226.82,7.03"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Interaction between conceptual complexity and the dominant focus of the instruction content when predicting verdict punitiveness.</figDesc></figure>

Was she aware, for example, that she had a gun in her hand, and that she was squeezing the trigger? Could she perceive that she was shooting at a person, and not at a tree, for example? If you believe that her awareness and perception were so distorted, as a result of mental disease or defect, that she did not know what she was doing, no more than an infant, brute or wild beast, then you should find her "Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity." If, on the other hand, you believe that her awareness and perception were not so distorted, then you should find her "Guilty". Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</p><p>Linguistic complexity: 11.20 (reading maturity metric) Conceptual complexity: 1 (average components per concept) Amount of information: 160 words Proportion of supplementary information: 31.88% Presentation format: Written Dominant focus of instruction content: Mostly on acquittal</p></div>

Concepts are CAPITALIZED, independent components of concepts are italicized, and independent key principles are bolded.</p><p>The BURDEN OF PROOF for this charge in this state is upon the prosecution. Before you can find a man guilty of a crime, the prosecution must show by a PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE that the defendant committed the crime. That is, it is up to the prosecution to prove that there is more evidence of the defendant's guilt than of his innocence. If the weight of the evidence for the defendant's guilt is greater than the weight of the evidence for his innocence, then the prosecution has met its burden and you must find the defendant guilty as charged. If, on the other hand, you feel that the evidence for the defendant's innocence has greater weight than the evidence for his guilt, then you must find him not guilty of auto theft. If the evidence suggests to you that it is more likely that the defendant committed auto theft than not, the law requires you to find him guilty, as charged; but if you feel that it is more likely that he is innocent than guilty, the law requires you to find him not guilty. In summary, your verdict must favor the side that has presented the stronger evidence.

Concepts are CAPITALIZED, independent components of concepts are italicized, and independent key principles are bolded.</p><p>Before you retire to the deliberation room, I must ask that you consider this: You will recall that the prosecution introduced testimony from Patrolman Alvin Matheson who testified that while under arrest, the defendant, Ronald Oliver, confessed that he had stolen the car. However, before you accept this fact that the defendant confessed, you must first consider the circumstances and decide for yourselves whether he confessed voluntarily and without coercion. If you decide that the confession was coerced or involuntary, then you should disregard this confession entirely and not allow it to influence your verdict because it is constitutionally unfair to an accused person who is under arrest for an officer of the law to pressure him through threats or trick him through offers of immunity into admitting to something against his will. Such tactics violate the individual's constitutional right to due process of law. On the other hand, if you are convinced that Ron Oliver did confess freely and without coercion, then you should consider this fact as evidence in the case against the defendant.
