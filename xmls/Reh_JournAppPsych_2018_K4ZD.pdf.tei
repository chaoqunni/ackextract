<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The extant social undermining literature suggests that employees envy and, consequently, undermine coworkers when they feel that these coworkers are better off and thus pose a threat to their own current status. With the present research, we draw on the sociofunctional approach to emotions to propose that an anticipated future status threat can similarly incline employees to feel envy toward, and subsequently undermine, their coworkers. We argue that employees pay special attention to coworkers' past development in relation to their own, because faster-rising coworkers may pose a future status threat even if they are still performing worse in absolute terms in the present. With a set of two behavioral experiments (N ϭ 90 and N ϭ 168), we establish that participants react to faster-rising coworkers with social undermining behavior when the climate is competitive (vs. less competitive). We extended these results with a scenario experiment (N ϭ 376) showing that, in these situations, participants extrapolate lower future status than said coworker and thus respond with envy and undermining behavior. A two-wave field study (N ϭ 252) replicated the complete moderated serial mediation model. Our findings help to explain why employees sometimes undermine others who present no immediate threat to their status. As such, we extend theorizing on social undermining and social comparison.</p></div>

Potentially, these studies assumed that employees already factor their past trajectories into their assessments of current status, but this has not been explicitly tested or clarified.</p><p>However, people also care about maintaining their status into the future <ref type="bibr" coords="1,342.50,593.34,115.26,7.91" target="#b10">(Bothner, Kang, &amp; Stuart, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,459.77,593.34,86.27,7.91;1,306.00,604.41,20.50,7.91" target="#b77">Pettit, Yong, &amp; Spataro, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,329.79,604.41,108.11,7.91" target="#b89">Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,441.19,604.41,101.11,7.91;1,306.00,615.48,74.54,7.91" target="#b90">Scheepers, Ellemers, &amp; Sintemaartensdijk, 2009</ref>). The dimensions that underlie these comparisons change over time and at a different pace for each employee (e.g., some employees receive promotions more often, see faster improvements, or get steeper pay raises than others; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,517.75,648.68,28.29,7.91;1,306.00,659.75,54.35,7.91" target="#b17">Chen &amp; Mathieu, 2008)</ref>. Thus, it seems theoretically conceivable that employees will compare their past development against their coworkers' development, using these temporal trajectories to extrapolate their possible future status. We refer to these comparisons as temporal social comparisons, which integrate social comparison theory (cf. between subjects; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,418.75,715.04,60.75,7.91" target="#b35">Festinger, 1954)</ref> with findings on status momentum <ref type="bibr" coords="2,116.02,77.04,168.15,7.91" target="#b76">(Pettit, Sivanathan, Gladstone, &amp; Marr, 2013)</ref>.

We further expect the relationship between temporal social comparison and future status threat to be stronger in highly competitive organizations. Our theoretical model is depicted in <ref type="figure" coords="2,183.94,165.04,29.87,7.91">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>With our study, we make three major contributions to previous research. First, we introduce unfavorable temporal social comparisons, and the resultant future status threat, as an additional process that leads to social undermining. As such, we extend the social undermining literature by arguing that the core mediating process of envy can also be triggered by future status threat, independent of whether coworkers currently compare more or less favorably. In doing so, we fill a gap in previous theorizing-namely, why some employees decide to undermine coworkers who are not presently better off than they are <ref type="bibr" coords="2,135.94,275.04,65.34,7.91" target="#b57">(Lam et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Second, our investigation into temporal social comparisons involves a combination of social comparison theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.32,297.04,38.74,7.91;2,48.00,308.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b35">(Festinger, 1954)</ref>, which has portrayed comparisons as static, and the temporal notion of status momentum <ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.53,319.04,66.01,7.91" target="#b76">(Pettit et al., 2013)</ref>.

By applying a temporal component to the study of social comparison, we account for the dynamic nature of status in organizations and, by extension, can help explain why and when employees socially undermine each other.</p><p>Third, we extend research on the negative interpersonal effects of competitive reward systems. Specifically, by showing that employees in competitive organizations can perceive both current and future status threats, we highlight that competition leads to more negative interpersonal behavior than previously assumed. Also, by considering the moderating influence of competition, we follow calls to explain social undermining via the interplay of comparison processes and organizational factors <ref type="bibr" coords="2,65.56,506.03,75.39,7.91" target="#b26">(Duffy et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,144.48,506.03,139.52,7.91" target="#b28">Duffy, Shaw, &amp; Schaubroeck, 2008)</ref>, and thereby provide a better understanding of the involved processes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.23,528.03,117.74,7.91" target="#b53">(Jacoby &amp; Sassenberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,212.28,528.03,75.75,7.91;2,48.00,539.03,44.91,7.91" target="#b94">Spencer, Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005)</ref>.

In other words, just the mere expectation that others will have higher future status can be enough to generate a perceived threat and envy. The envy resulting from future status threat may spur social undermining to hinder the coworkers' efforts to excel. At the very least, social undermining should be a successful strategy for avoiding even lower future status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal Social Comparison as Predictor of Future Status Threat</head><p>People should be motivated to understand the future trajectory of their status. From a sociofunctional perspective on emotions, people should actively search for information that informs them about threats to their future status. We propose that employees can accomplish this by comparing the perceived development of their relative standing against a coworker's development-a process we refer to as temporal social comparison. Such comparisons should allow employees to extrapolate their relative trajectory into the future.

In other words, a positive (negative) trajectory in the past would suggest higher (lower) future status. We transfer this principle of momentum to the context of social comparisons: If a focal employee's standing showed a steeper trajectory in the past compared with a coworker's standing, this would suggest that the focal employee can expect higher status than said coworker in the future. Likewise, a weaker trajectory should point to lower future status expectations. With these temporal social comparisons, so we argue, employees can extrapolate their future status relative to a comparison target. Unfavorable comparisons-meaning the focal employee expects the coworker to have higher future status-should elicit envy and social undermining. Hence, our approach implies that employees can envy and socially undermine coworkers independent of their current relative standing.</p></div>

The envy arising from such uncertainty alarms employees about potential threats and spurs them to manage their social environment.

This would also make accompanying emotions like envy more salient and accessible. In sum, we expect that the relationship between temporal social comparison and future status threat will be stronger for competitive organizations. As a consequence, unfavorable temporal social comparisons should lead to more future status threat, envy, and social undermining in competitive organizations compared with noncompetitive organizations (see <ref type="figure" coords="4,522.55,88.04,23.50,7.91;4,306.00,99.04,3.25,7.91">Figure  1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Studies</head><p>To test our hypothesis, we conducted three studies with complementary methods. In Study 1a and 1b, we manipulated temporal social comparison and competition to establish the basic rationale that negative temporal social comparison can lead to actual and meaningful social undermining behaviors under high competition. To keep study realism high and demand characteristics low, we refrained from separately measuring the psychological processes of future status threat and envy. We saved that measurement for Study 2, using a vignette to manipulate static and temporal social comparison, as well as competition. Specifically, we asked participants for their reaction to the vignette and how they would behave (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,320.33,326.34,86.24,7.91" target="#b87">Robinson &amp; Clore, 2001</ref>, who argue that imagined experiences are a reasonably proxy for actual experiences). Study 3, finally, was a two-wave field study in which we asked participants to think of a real coworker and then measured our constructs of interest.</p><p>Data were collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). 1 We followed recommendations to improve data quality when using MTurk samples by only recruiting workers from the U.S. with a high reputation (i.e., those who have at least 50 completed tasks and a high ratio (95%) of approved-vs.-submitted tasks), as well as including instructional manipulation checks (IMCs) in Studies 2 and 3 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,365.23,436.34,85.28,7.91" target="#b66">(Meade &amp; Craig, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,453.19,436.34,92.85,7.91;4,306.00,447.34,61.13,7.91" target="#b72">Oppenheimer, Meyvis, &amp; Davidenko, 2009</ref>). If participants failed to correctly answer the manipulation checks, they could still finish the survey, but were excluded from subsequent analyses. To check the robustness of our results, we ran our analyses for both Study 2 and 3 with and without these screenouts, but found the same results. We also checked for nonsense response patterns and outliers in terms of completion time, 2 but the results did not change significantly (i.e., our hypothesis would still be supported).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a Method</head><p>Sample. We recruited N ϭ 108 participants from MTurk and randomly assigned them to one of two conditions (high vs. low competition). Of these participants, n ϭ 18 (17%) indicated at the end of the experiment (before debriefing) that they had at least some doubts about the realism of the procedure. As our measurement of undermining depended on participants believing our instructions, we excluded these participants for the subsequent analysis, leading to a final sample of N ϭ 90 participants (53% females, M age ϭ 37 years, SD ϭ 10 years).</p><p>Procedure. Participants on MTurk were invited to a study called "Intellectual performance in the presence of a co-actor." We used this title to give MTurkers a credible reason for why they would be matched and compared with another participant in the study. Upon entering the study, participants had to first sign into a virtual group chat that was designed for this study. This virtual group chat was described as a virtual waiting room where participants allegedly had to wait until they could be matched to another participant. To increase realism, we designed the chat so that people could see other participants entering, leaving or waiting in the group chat because people had to sign in with a name. Participants stayed during the entire study in the chat room because at some point during the study they would be matched with another participant. The number of participants was always visible on the screen, newcomers or leavers were announced, and the entire list of participants in the chat room could be viewed by clicking on an included symbol. We did not allow participants to communicate via the chat or directly with each other (unseen from us). When people entered the chat room, they were then redirected to the actual study. We employed the virtual waiting room to increase realism because our design made it theoretically possible that someone could not be matched right away. We reason that this design is similar to lab studies where respondents first meet in a waiting room before entering a cubicle, at which point they are told that they will allegedly be working with the other respondents via computer-mediated communication.</p><p>In the actual study, participants had to first perform five rounds of a verbal ability test before they were told that they would be matched with another participant and then have to complete a final round of the test. We also told them that they could earn a bonus of $1.00 depending on their performance in the final round. After the first five rounds, participants received bogus temporal social comparison feedback on their test performance relative to two potential matching partners (other participants; more on this later). Then we asked them to "Please indicate how much you want to be matched with this participant?" (1 ϭ I do not want to be matched with this participant at all, 7 ϭ I very much want to be matched with this participant) for both potential matching partners. Because the competition for status and recognition constitutes one behavioral indicator of social undermining <ref type="bibr" coords="5,183.41,704.03,68.81,7.91" target="#b24">(Duffy et al., 2002)</ref>, we used their answers on this item as our measure of undermining. We reasoned that respondents who chose to exclude someone who had developed favorably over time would seek to maximize their chance of winning the bonus while hindering the other participant's chances. After indicating their matching preference, participants answered some questions about the credibility of the procedure. Finally, they were debriefed about the real purpose of the study and were rewarded with $2.00 on MTurk.</p><p>Manipulations. Temporal social comparison (TSC) was manipulated as a within-subjects factor by giving participants bogus performance feedback on a verbal ability test (solving anagrams) relative to two potential matching partners. An anagram is a string of letters that needs to be unscrambled into a real word or a different word using the letters in the string (e.g., the solution to the anagram "being" would be "begin," and "omon" would become "moon"). Using anagrams to manipulate relative performance feedback is a common procedure in studies on comparisons and/or unethical behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="5,508.84,248.00,37.19,7.91;5,306.00,259.40,69.22,7.91" target="#b37">(Flynn &amp; Amanatullah, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,377.84,259.40,75.81,7.91" target="#b42">Gino &amp; Pierce, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,456.27,259.40,89.77,7.91;5,306.00,270.79,73.23,7.91" target="#b80">Pierce, Kilduff, Galinsky, &amp; Sivanathan, 2013)</ref>. To make the comparison more relevant and engaging, we framed the anagram test as a measure of analytic reasoning, which is an important skill in many domains (academic work, professional life, etc.), and told them that people with high scores in this test usually have more successful careers. To minimize their ability to track their performance and their suspicion about the feedback, we told participants that their scores would be based on the number of anagrams they correctly solved, as well as the length and difficulty of these anagrams. Furthermore, we only presented them with their rank relative to other participants, rather than their absolute scores.</p><p>For each of the two potential matching partners, participants received bogus feedback on both their own performance and that of their potential matching partner across the five rounds. The performance feedback was presented graphically (see <ref type="figure" coords="5,509.18,430.36,30.38,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>), and we randomized the order in which participants were presented with each of the two TSC figures. The favorable TSC showed a potential matching partner whose performance slightly decreased over the five rounds of the anagram task. The unfavorable TSC showed a potential matching partner whose performance strongly increased over the five rounds. The participant's performance in both comparisons stayed relatively constant over the five rounds with some slight fluctuations to make it look realistic. In both comparisons, we held the current static comparison (SSC) in round 5 constant to rule out the possibility that SSC could explain the results. The difference in round five between the participant and each of the two potential matching partners was five ranks, with the participant holding rank 90 and the potential matching partners holding rank 85 (of 100, which represented the best performance in the task).</p><p>For competition, which we treated as a between-subjects factor, we embedded the manipulation into the instruction for the anagram task. Participants in the high competition condition were told that they could earn an additional $1.00 if they outperformed their matching partner in the final round of the anagram task. Participants in the low competition condition were told that they could earn an additional $1.00 if their individual performance in the final round exceeded a certain threshold independent of how well they performed relative to their matching partner. Regardless of the condition, all participants received the additional $1.00 at the end.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a Results</head><p>We tested the joint effect of TSC and competition on social undermining, measured as the unwillingness to be matched to the other participant, using multilevel ordered logistic regression. An ordered logistic regression is used when the outcome is measured on an ordinal scale, such as in our study. We applied the multilevel version of it (i.e., the MEOLOGIT command in Stata) because TSC was manipulated as a within-subjects factor and observations were therefore nested within individuals. The interpretation of the logit coefficients in the model follows the same rationale as the interpretation of coefficients in logistic or multinomial regression: It shows the increase in the log-odds of choosing a higher category in the order of the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable, while the other variables in the model remain constant.</p><p>The main effects of both TSC (b ϭ Ϫ.03, p ϭ .933, 95% CI [Ϫ.81, .74]) and competition (b ϭ .38, p ϭ .412, 95% CI [Ϫ.52, 1.28]) on social undermining were not significant. The logit coefficient for the TSC ϫ competition interaction was Ϫ.95, p ϭ .086, 90% CI [Ϫ1.86, Ϫ0.04], 95% CI [Ϫ2.04, .14], and thus significant on a two-tailed 10% level as indicated by our directed hypothesis. An analysis of this interaction effect showed that, under high competition, participants were more likely to prefer to be matched to the other participant when the TSC was favorable compared with unfavorable. Specifically, contrasts revealed that under high competition, the log-odds for expressing a higher matching preference for the potential matching partner in the favorable TSC condition (b ϭ 4.20) were higher than the log-odds for expressing a higher matching preference for the potential matching partner in the unfavorable TSC condition (b ϭ 3. 14], and thus significant on a two-tailed 10% level as indicated by our directed hypothesis. In short, we found support for our hypothesis that unfavorable temporal social comparisons (TSC) would increase social undermining, particularly in a competitive context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1b Results</head><p>We used ordered logistic regression to test the interactive effect of TSC and competition on social undermining, which was measured as the reluctance to recommend Alter for another experiment.

In other words, when competition was low, participants were more reluctant to recommend Alter for another experiment when TSC was unfavorable compared with favorable. Meanwhile, the difference between the unfavorable TSC and the favorable TSC condition under high competition was larger than the difference between the same conditions under low competition, contrast ϭ 1.32, p ϭ .027, 95% CI <ref type="bibr" coords="7,59.62,451.04,33.11,7.91">[.15, 2.48</ref>]. This supports our hypothesis that unfavorable TSC leads to social undermining under high competition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Studies 1a and 1b tested the joint effect of temporal social comparison and competition on social undermining toward a comparison person. In two independent samples that used different designs (within-subjects design in Study 1a; between-subjects design in Study 1b) and different behavioral indicators of social undermining, we found that an unfavorable temporal social comparison (vs. a favorable one) led to more social undermining, but only when participants competed with the comparison person. Study 1 provides first evidence that people undermine a comparison person when their relative development is unfavorable. In addition, and complementary to previous studies on negative interpersonal behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="7,146.42,627.04,62.07,7.91" target="#b57">Lam et al., 2011)</ref>, this study measured actual undermining behavior in a realistic, yet controlled setting in which participants were highly involved. As temporal social comparison information was presented separately for the participant and Alter, Study 1 also suggests that people naturally pick up on patterns of relative trajectory and engage in temporal social comparisons.</p><p>To keep realism high and demand character low, Studies 1a and 1b did not include psychometric measures of the assumed medi-ating variables. Study 2 complements Studies 1a and 1b by testing the full model in a controlled environment using a different method (scenario experiment). Whereas Studies 1a and 1b held static social comparison constant, Study 2 manipulated static social comparison to test whether temporal social comparison and competition explain social undermining irrespective of one's current standing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Method Sample. We recruited N ϭ 401 participants from MTurk and randomly assigned them to a 2 (TSC: performance trend better than coworker, performance trend worse than coworker) by 2 (Competition: high, low) by 2 (Static Social Comparison (SSC): current performance better than coworker, current performance worse than coworker) between-subjects factorial design. Of these participants, 25 (6%) failed to correctly answer the IMC. We also compared completion times, finding that those who failed the IMC completed the survey faster (mean completion time ϭ 3.2 min) than those who passed the IMC (mean completion time ϭ 4.8 min). This difference was significant at a 10% level, suggesting that participants who failed the IMC paid less attention to the survey. We therefore removed them for the analysis, leaving a final sample of N ϭ 376 (40% females, M age ϭ 35 years, SD ϭ 9.65).</p><p>Manipulation. To manipulate TSC, SSC and competition, we used a vignette that asked participants to imagine the situation as vividly as possible. Such vignette studies have been shown to elicit responses that are comparable to actual lab designs <ref type="bibr" coords="7,498.48,418.04,47.56,7.91;7,306.00,429.04,43.83,7.91" target="#b87">(Robinson &amp; Clore, 2001)</ref>. Participants first read that they have been working in a company for several years alongside a particular colleague, the fictitious comparison person Alex, who has the same position with similar tasks, responsibilities, and company tenure (to avoid gender effects, we chose a name that could belong to either a female or male person). Next, participants read about whether their performance evaluation was a) better (vs. worse) than Alex's performance in the current year (SSC) and b) better (vs. worse) than Alex's performance development in the last two years (TSC). At the end of the scenario, participants read about the competitive (vs. noncompetitive) nature of the organization. We derived the sentences for this manipulation from the competitive climate scale by <ref type="bibr" coords="7,306.00,561.04,105.79,7.91">Brown and colleagues (1998)</ref>.

In order for moderated serial moderation to be supported, the serial indirect effect-which is the effect of the independent variable (IV) on the dependent variable (DV) passing through two mediators (M1 and M2) in series-has to vary at high and low levels of the moderator (Mod). Thus, for our hypothesis to be supported, the indirect effect of TSC on social undermining via future status threat and envy has to be positive and significant at high levels of competition, as well as significantly stronger at high compared with low levels of competition.</p><p>To calculate the serial indirect effect, we estimated three multiple regression models.

In the second model, the second mediator was regressed on the independent variable, the moderator, their interaction, and the first mediator. In the third model, the dependent variable was regressed on the independent variable, the moderator, their interaction, and the two mediators.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Study 2 indicates that unfavorable temporal social comparison can lead to future status threat, which then motivates envy and the intent to socially undermine a coworker. As expected, the indirect effect of temporal social comparison on social undermining via future status threat and envy was stronger under high competition. Thus, Study 2 adds to Study 1 by establishing the psychological process in the relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparison and social undermining in competitive contexts. Specifically, the study showed that envy can also be elicited by future threats, and that unfavorable temporal social comparisons inform individuals about such threats. Moreover, by controlling for static social comparison, we showed that future status threat motivates envy and social undermining above and beyond that resulting from a currently unfavorable standing relative to a coworker.</p><p>Our experimental design allowed us to draw causal inferences with a high degree of internal validity, albeit with drawbacks regarding the generalizability (external validity) of our findings.

Also, employees in reality can assess their standing in organizations on more dimensions than just performance. Study 3 addresses those limitations. First, we used a field sample to increase the external validity of our findings.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Method Sample and procedures. We conducted two surveys via MTurk that occurred at two different time points, two weeks apart. Registered MTurkers could participate in the study at Time 1 if they were at least 18 years old, presently employed at an organization with a minimum tenure of two years, and willing and able to participate at both time points. At Time 1, the survey asked participants to think of a colleague who has been working in the company for at least two years and then type in the first name of that colleague. To avoid having participants think of a friend and thereby obtaining a broad range of performance trends, we randomly asked them to think of a colleague with either a belowaverage, an average, or an above-average performance development in the past few years. We personalized all items via dynamic programming so that they directly referred to the indicated colleague (in the measures below, "Alter" is a placeholder name for the comparison other). We then assessed all variables except for our dependent variable, social undermining. At Time 2, participants were reminded of the name of the coworker (Alter) they provided at Time 1 and then filled out the social undermining measure.</p><p>At Time 1, N ϭ 640 participants completed the survey, 62 of which (10%) failed to pass one or more of the Time 1 IMCs. A total of 283 participants (44% of Time 1) completed the Time 2 survey, 17 of which (6%) failed to pass the respective IMC. Again, we compared the T1 completion times of participants who passed all attention checks (n ϭ 252) or failed at least one attention check item (n ϭ 31). We found a marginally significant difference in the mean duration time, which was 11.14 min for those who passed all IMCs and 8.87 min for those who failed at least one IMC.

These variables were not significantly related to Time 2 participation, suggesting that our final sample did not differ significantly from those participants who only completed the Time 1 survey.</p><p>As temporal social comparison is a construct that has not, to the best of our knowledge, been measured before, and because of the high correlation between TSC and SSC in our sample (r ϭ .71), we tested whether our participants cognitively differentiated between static and temporal social comparison. In other words, we assessed their discriminant validity. First, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to compare the fit of a two-factor model with SSC and TSC as separate latent factors against a model with all 16 items loaded on a single factor.

We permitted the error terms of items measuring the same comparison dimension (e.g., current performance as an indicator of static social comparison and performance development as an indicator of temporal social comparison) to correlate. This is recommended when there are similarities in the item content and/or wording, as it is with the indicators of our two measures <ref type="bibr" coords="10,516.29,405.14,29.74,7.91;10,306.00,416.20,19.37,7.91" target="#b13">(Brown, 2015)</ref>.

Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant coefficient for TSC (␤ ϭ .46, p Ͻ .001), as well as for the interaction between TSC and competition (␤ ϭ Ϫ.28, p Ͻ .003). Further, there was a significant difference in explained variance between the regression models with and without TSC and the TSC ϫ competition interaction, ⌬R 2 ϭ .04, F(2, 241) ϭ 13.07, p Ͻ .001.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The present paper proposed that employees' envy and social undermining toward coworkers arises not only from perceptions of current status threat (i.e., being presently worse off than a coworker), but also via an anticipated future status threat (i.e., being potentially worse off than a coworker in the future irrespective of current relative standing). Across three experiments and a field study, we confirmed that employees anticipate future status threat when they perceive that their own past development trajectory is less favorable than a coworker's. In response, the respective employees feel envy and subsequently undermine the coworker. As expected, competitive scenarios exacerbated the outcomes of such temporal social comparisons. These dynamics exceeded employees' social comparisons regarding their current status.</p><p>This study contributes to the envy and social undermining literature by introducing future status threat as an additional motivation for employees' undermining behavior. Previous research in this domain suggested that employees only envy and undermine coworkers who are already better off and, thus, threaten their present status. Consequently, scholars did not expect undermining in situations where a coworker is currently worse off than the focal employee <ref type="bibr" coords="12,85.12,605.04,62.75,7.91" target="#b57">(Lam et al., 2011)</ref>. Although this notion is both logically sound and empirically supported, the temporal perspective reveals that other comparisons can be equally threatening. Because individuals are concerned with how their status will develop in the future <ref type="bibr" coords="12,71.61,649.04,66.37,7.91" target="#b77">(Pettit et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,140.10,649.04,79.72,7.91" target="#b90">Scheepers et al., 2009)</ref>, they are sensitive to signals of potentially lower future status. This anticipated lower status then drives their feelings and behavior toward the comparison person in the present. This may explain why employees would harm coworkers with lower current standing. Previous research assumed that these low performers experience hostility and victimization as a punishment for their inferior contributions toward joint goals <ref type="bibr" coords="12,350.41,77.04,117.42,7.91" target="#b54">(Jensen, Patel, &amp; Raver, 2014)</ref>. There is empirical support for this argument, yet we contend that envy could also prompt harming behaviors if an employee feels that a coworker's future status poses a threat.</p><p>Moreover, our studies represent a first step in disentangling the cognitions that underlie employee comparisons. In their studies, <ref type="bibr" coords="12,306.00,144.20,100.01,7.91">Lam and colleagues (2011)</ref> told participants to compare their last two weeks of personal performance against a colleague's; <ref type="bibr" coords="12,514.98,155.39,31.07,7.91;12,306.00,166.58,53.88,7.91" target="#b56">Kim and Glomb (2014)</ref> asked participants to think of the performance feedback they received from their supervisor in the past year, and Jensen and colleagues (2014) used the overall performance ratings that their participants had received. Although the employee and/or supervisor ratings in these studies do cover a time frame, and could have been informed by the participants' personal and/or relative performance development, the respective measures did not distinguish participants' relative development from their current relative performance. As a consequence, it was not clear how participants construed the comparison information, which aspects of performance they considered (i.e., current relative performance, relative performance trend, or some combination thereof), and which of them finally drove their negative interpersonal behavior. By considering past, present, and future status assessments simultaneously, we provide a more nuanced picture of how different types of status threat (current/actual vs. future/potential) elicit the same functional emotions (envy) and behaviors (social undermining) to defend one's status.</p><p>Our studies also raise a question: Would classically "upward comparisons" still be experienced as threatening when individuals also consider their relative development <ref type="bibr" coords="12,458.53,390.45,83.47,7.91" target="#b33">(Exline &amp; Lobel, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,329.42,401.64,45.50,7.91" target="#b105">Wills, 1981)</ref>? Upward comparisons might be less threatening if the comparison target's standing shows a weaker relative trajectory, which would suggest that the focal person may quickly surpass the comparison other. As such, future studies may want to account for the temporal nature of status at the workplace by considering the net effects of static and temporal social comparisons <ref type="bibr" coords="12,325.00,468.80,78.48,7.91" target="#b18">(Chizhik et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,406.47,468.80,64.86,7.91" target="#b76">Pettit et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>More generally, our studies contribute to the question of how individuals evaluate their current status and which comparisons they use to predict their future status. Interestingly, both Study 2 and 3 found that employees' comparisons of current relative standing also predict future status threat. Although we did not present any a priori hypothesis on this relationship, this does make sense. If individuals currently enjoy a much higher standing than the comparison person, they may expect to have higher status in the (near) future as well, because it may simply take a while until the comparison person "catches up" and reaches the same level in terms of standing.</p><p>In this context, there is a question about which organizational situations spur people to consider their past status development, their present status, or their expected future status. At this time, we speculate that past status developments (and the resulting expectations for future status) should be particularly relevant when employees work together with the same coworkers for longer periods of time, have the chance to observe their own and others' trajectories, and potentially compete with these coworkers for future awards and promotions. In contrast, current status assessments will likely be more important in short-term-oriented work relationships-for instance, project teams in consultancies, where This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>employees' direct colleagues (and hence their potential comparison persons) frequently change. Finally, our study established that interorganizational competition significantly moderates the impact of temporal social comparisons: Specifically, a highly competitive climate exacerbates the social undermining that follows from such comparisons. Competing with coworkers for status and recognition increases employees' uncertainty regarding their future status <ref type="bibr" coords="13,210.86,154.04,77.19,7.91;13,48.00,165.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b29">(Dunn &amp; Schweitzer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,70.87,165.04,57.49,7.91" target="#b35">Festinger, 1954)</ref>, which makes comparisons with coworkers more salient.

It is possible that participants were distracted with other tasks or simply not focused on the survey (e.g., from tiredness). To limit this concern, we employed several recommended measures for increasing data quality (IMCs; inclusion of MTurkers with high approval rate and experience; <ref type="bibr" coords="13,160.51,638.04,96.51,7.91" target="#b47">Hauser &amp; Schwarz, 2016)</ref> and designed Studies 1a and 1b to be highly engaging for participants <ref type="bibr" coords="13,48.00,660.04,100.81,7.91" target="#b46">(Greenberg &amp; Eskew, 1993)</ref>. Furthermore, any distractions should occur randomly and thus not negate our findings. Moreover, MTurk offered us the advantage of a diverse sample that was not company-or industry-specific, which increases the generalizability of our findings. To be fair, participants on MTurk tend to have lower-paying jobs (Bartel <ref type="bibr" coords="13,147.82,715.04,98.96,7.91" target="#b7">Sheehan &amp; Pittman, 2016)</ref>, so future research may want to investigate the effects of future status threat in higher-paying professions, such as in the finance industry. In sum, an increasing body of literature continues to investigate the MTurk population with respect to data quality and generalizability, suggesting that MTurk samples are suitable for behavioral research so long as one takes steps to ensure high data quality <ref type="bibr" coords="13,498.76,132.04,47.29,7.91;13,306.00,143.04,34.49,7.91" target="#b43">(Goodman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,343.49,143.04,78.24,7.91" target="#b64">Mason &amp; Suri, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,424.72,143.04,101.09,7.91" target="#b73">Paolacci &amp; Chandler, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Another possible limitation is the use of self-ratings in Study 3, which invites common method bias <ref type="bibr" coords="13,439.17,165.04,106.88,7.91;13,306.00,176.04,73.33,7.91" target="#b81">(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003)</ref>. To somewhat alleviate such concerns, we assessed social undermining two weeks after we assessed all other variables. Moreover, common method bias cannot create artifactual interactions between variables; rather, it attenuates the variance explained by existing interactions, which ultimately makes it more difficult to detect them <ref type="bibr" coords="13,416.41,231.04,51.02,7.91" target="#b32">(Evans, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,470.72,231.04,75.32,7.91;13,306.00,242.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b65">McClelland &amp; Judd, 1993)</ref>. Further, social undermining is a rather covert form of harming another person, making it difficult to use other-ratings. Given previous research, we felt comfortable assessing social undermining in the form of self-reports in Study 3 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,515.22,275.04,30.84,7.91;13,306.00,286.03,33.93,7.91" target="#b26">Duffy et al., 2012)</ref>. In addition, we assessed two different aspects of undermining behavior in Studies 1a and 1b (behavioral experiments in a realistic setting). Nevertheless, future research could utilize more objective measures for employees' relative standing and how their standing has developed: for instance, their actual salary, formal job position, or objective performance data (e.g., sales or customer satisfaction).</p><p>In this regard, we must note that our test of mediation in Studies 2 and 3 was mediation via measurement rather than via an experimental causal chain <ref type="bibr" coords="13,385.19,385.03,79.05,7.91" target="#b94">(Spencer et al., 2005)</ref>. Also, we simultaneously measured the psychological process via future status threat and envy, which could have created some demand character. Our decision to still measure these constructs partly stemmed from the number of experimental conditions that we already had in Studies 1a and 1b (2 ϫ 2) and in Study 2 (2 ϫ 2 ϫ 2). Manipulating an additional two variables (future status threat and envy) would have resulted in a large number of experimental conditions and made it more difficult to establish a realistic context. Further, measuring future status threat in Study 2, rather than manipulating it, allowed us to test whether people mentally extrapolate their past relative trajectories to predict their future status.</p><p>For future research, scholars could determine when individuals rely on temporal versus static social comparisons, and investigate contextual factors beyond competition, like career stage or social motivations. For example, employees who are fresh in their career, and who are uncertain as to whether they will be able to meet their future targets, might particularly rely on temporal social comparisons to predict whether they will be able to keep up with their coworkers (self-evaluation motive). In contrast, employees at later stages in their career, who have limited opportunities for growth (e.g., because they already occupy a high-status position), might prefer static social comparisons to reassure themselves of their high status (selfenhancement motive; cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="13,392.21,638.03,74.87,7.91">Tröster et al., in press)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Social undermining among employees negatively affects employee outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,137.52,143.04,72.77,7.91" target="#b24">Duffy et al., 2002)</ref> and thereby creates social costs for organizations <ref type="bibr" coords="14,166.02,154.04,118.15,7.91" target="#b21">(Cole, Shipp, &amp; Taylor, 2016)</ref>. Further, recent research suggests that being undermined can lead employees to reciprocate (i.e., engage in undermining themselves; <ref type="bibr" coords="14,48.00,187.04,119.72,7.91" target="#b61">Lee, Kim, Bhave, &amp; Duffy, 2016)</ref>, thus initiating a vicious cycle of ever-broader levels of social undermining. Clearly, organizations have a vested interest in minimizing such behavior. Our study offers suggestions as to what managers could do to circumvent social undermining at the workplace. Given that comparisons among coworkers are ubiquitous in organizations <ref type="bibr" coords="14,227.65,242.04,60.39,7.91;14,48.00,253.04,20.29,7.91" target="#b45">(Greenberg et al., 2007)</ref> and comprise a rich source for employees' self-evaluations, simply trying to reduce the frequency of such comparisons seems improbable. However, managers can help make comparisons less threatening to employees-for instance, by assigning different spheres of influence to employees who compete for status. They can, for example, give these employees different tasks or assign them to different projects to invite less comparison among them. Additionally, managers may give employees opportunities to improve their standing in these domains through mentoring and training. If employees are able to improve their performance over time, they can make more favorable inferences about their expected status, particularly when they are not in direct competition with their coworkers. As the need to defend one's standing becomes less salient, employees may abstain from social undermining. On this point, managers should note that unfavorable temporal social comparisons are particularly salient in a competitive (Study 1 and 2) or uncooperative (Study 3) climate. In practice, such dynamics may be fueled by organizational practices, such as highly competitive reward systems or forced rankings <ref type="bibr" coords="14,263.62,440.04,20.94,7.91;14,48.00,451.04,38.78,7.91" target="#b23">(Creelman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,88.55,451.04,63.38,7.91" target="#b31">Eichenwald, 2012)</ref>. Thus, our findings clearly suggest that managers should try to reduce interpersonal competition and instead foster a cooperative climate.</p><p>Granted, the above may be easier said than done. For organizations, there is a central question about whether the benefits of competition and comparison still outweigh their social costs <ref type="bibr" coords="14,269.58,506.04,14.78,7.91;14,48.00,517.04,56.04,7.91" target="#b59">(Larkin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,106.23,517.04,83.28,7.91" target="#b60">Lazear &amp; Rosen, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,191.69,517.04,54.80,7.91" target="#b75">Peterson, 2013)</ref>. Managers in organizations thus face a dilemma: They have to motivate their workforce to work hard and develop their full potential, which might be accomplished by competitive reward systems that induce comparisons (and envy). Yet, this comes at the cost of potentially lower performance among those who are being undermined. To add to this, our study indicates that employees engage in both "upward" (i.e., toward those who are better off; <ref type="bibr" coords="14,224.92,594.03,63.14,7.91" target="#b57">Lam et al., 2011)</ref> and "downward" undermining (i.e., toward those who represent a future threat). Thus, the field may be underestimating the social costs of undermining at work.</p><p>Practitioners may also consider these dynamics in light of other organizational areas, like talent management. For instance, supervisors with stagnating performance might refuse to support "rising stars" because of the future threat they present. As such, they may reduce their support and mentoring, or actively undermine new talent to avoid being outperformed in the future. Going one step further, supervisors with weak past performance might even abstain from hiring potential employees who could pose a future threat to their position <ref type="bibr" coords="14,389.12,77.03,71.44,7.91" target="#b39">(Garcia et al., 2010)</ref>.
