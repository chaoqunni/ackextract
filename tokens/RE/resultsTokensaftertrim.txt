When colleagues attribute higher prosocial motivation to the helper, they feel more grateful and admire the helper more (Weinstein, DeHaan, & Ryan, 2010), the experience of which may lead to more genuine expression of appreciation
Help recipients' expression of gratitude may in turn spark a positive spiral of interpersonal interactions between the helper and the recipient, making the experience of helping one's colleagues even more pleasant, further leading to heightened levels of positive affect
