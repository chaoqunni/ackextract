Measurement instruments and procedure IAT-RPSC
We used the IAT-RPSC as included in the first study, and D scores were computed in the same way
In this second study, participants' mean D score was À.57 (SD = .31), ranging between À1.44 and .05
IAT-RP (Dislich et al., 2010)
The IAT to assess RP developed by Dislich et al
(2010) included two target categories ('Me' and 'Other') and two (attribute) nonevaluative categories ('Risky' and 'Secure')
The words used for each category were adapted to Spanish from original words used by Dislich and colleagues
4 Participants had to respond with the same key to 'Me' or 'Secure' categories in the first combined block
In the second combined block, participants had to respond with the same key to 'Me' or 'Risky' categories
The order of block assignment was kept 3 Split-half reliability of the IAT-RPSC scores (.93) was above average for coefficients of equivalence (.79, computed as Cronbach's alpha and split-half reliability) for those reported in the meta-analysis of Hofmann et al
(2005) and higher than other available IATs to assess RP, such as the IRT-Global from Ronay and Kim (2006; Cronbach's a = .73) or the IAT-RP and SC-IAT from Dislich et al
(2010;a = .88 and a = .79, respectively) and similar to the most reliable IRT-Unique from Ronay and Kim (2006;a = .95)
Moreover, the IAT-RPSC scores also showed an acceptable test-retest reliability (.55) in our pilot study, it being higher than the mean of .50 reported in prior literature for IAT measures (Lane et al., 2007)
This result is very similar to the one reported for a self-esteem IAT (ranging from .52 to .69, e.g., Krause, Back, Egloff, & Schmukle, 2011), or other self-related IATs (e.g
.57 for the IAT-anxiety; Egloff & Schmukle, 2002)
Finally, internal consistency indices were average when compared with reliability coefficients obtained by selfreport measures related to RP (see Harrison et al., 2005, for a review of RP measurement instruments used in health settings), although it is more difficult to compare test-retest reliability because of the lack of this type of study in RP research
For example, score stability on the Adolescent Risk-taking Questionnaire (Gullone, Moore, Moss, & Boyd, 2000) showed two of the eight subscales under .50 and the rest below .60

constant for each participant
In this case, consistent with Dislich et al
(2010), the IAT-RP scores were computed such that a larger D score indicated a relative stronger association between 'Secure' and 'Me  (or 'Risk' and 'Other') compared with 'Secure' and 'Other' (or 'Risk' and 'Me')
Thus, a negative correlation between the IAT-RPSC and IAT-RP scores was expected
In the IAT-RP, participants' mean D score was .68 (SD = .27), ranging between .05 and 1.23
SC-IAT (Dislich et al., 2010)
As indicated by Dislich et al
(2010, p
22), the SC-IAT included only the single target category 'Gambling', and the attribute categories were 'Loss' versus 'Gain'
All procedural aspects of this SC-IAT followed Karpinski and Steinman's (2006) recommendations
A larger D score indicated a stronger association between 'Gambling' and 'Gain' rather than 'Gambling' and 'Loss' (see Dislich et al., 2010)
Participants' mean D score was .08 (SD = .34), ranging between À.59 and .80
Risk-taking behaviour
We used the same behavioural criterion developed for Study 1, which consisted of choosing between collecting the €16 voucher for participating or betting on double or quits, or subsequent bets
All participants agreed to participate in the risk-taking behaviour task, and score frequencies showed 13 participants on value 0, 12 participants on value 1, 6 participants on value 2, 4 participants on value 3 and 4 participants on value 4
While the level of congruence between one's values and behaviors may explain why more prosocial individuals derive more positive affect from helping behaviors than less prosocial individuals, another explanation can be found in the positive interpersonal interactions that are likely to develop between a prosocial helper and the colleagues receiving help
People with higher prosocial motivation tend to be better helpers because they engage in perspective taking (Grant & Berry, 2011) and pay more attention to others' needs and preferences (De Dreu, 2006)
That is, when giving help, such individuals are likely to show more genuine concerns about others, conduct more holistic analyses about help recipients' situations, and provide more effective help
This is likely to induce appreciative reactions from colleagues, as help recipients can infer help providers' motives through the helping process (Batson & Shaw, 1991)
When colleagues attribute higher prosocial motivation to the helper, they feel more grateful and admire the helper more (Weinstein, DeHaan, & Ryan, 2010), the experience of which may lead to more genuine expression of appreciation
Help recipients' expression of gratitude may in turn spark a positive spiral of interpersonal interactions between the helper and the recipient, making the experience of helping one's colleagues even more pleasant, further leading to heightened levels of positive affect
Thus, we expect that helping behaviors at work are particularly likely to generate affective resources for those people who have higher prosocial motivation
We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting us to integrate the theoretical work by Bolino et al
(2012) and to examine the boundary condition of when helping is more rewarding or depleting

For example, imagine a user who decides that her life will not be complete without doing the following: riding an elephant, holding a baby white tiger, visiting Iguazu Falls, and floating in the Dead Sea (to name some of the more popular options on the website)
On the one hand, she might see these as a smattering of four independent events
On the other hand, she might place them into two categories: being around animals and seeing bodies of water
The view she adopts will greatly influence her sense of progress
