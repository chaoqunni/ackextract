<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that materialistic values may be negatively associated with proenvironmental attitudes and behaviors. This research used meta-analytic techniques to assess: the mean effect size of the correlation between materialistic values and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors; the 'true effect size' adjusting for the reliability of the measures; and the effects of gender, age, population type and publication year on the size of the correlation. A significant, medium-sized association was found between materialistic values and both environmental attitudes and behaviors; these relationships were moderated by population type and publication year, but not by gender or age. Adjusted for reliability, the effects increased considerably, largely due to the low reliability of both types of environmental measures. The implications for future research are discussed, particularly with regard to the importance of using more reliable environmental measures and collecting data from more cultures. Practical applications are also highlighted, particularly as they might apply to environmental campaigns.</p></div>

These environmental values are predictive of a host of environmental attitudes and behaviors, from car use to the reduction and re-use of household waste <ref type="bibr" coords="1,202.73,560.11,45.21,7.54" target="#b2">(Barr, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,250.75,560.11,42.83,7.54;1,42.52,570.59,41.33,7.54" target="#b20">De Groot &amp; Steg, 2007)</ref>. These domain-specific values may be excellent predictors of environmental outcomes, but evidence is mounting that broader personal values may also have a place in predicting individuals' environmental behaviors and attitudes. It is within this context that we consider the personal value of materialism: a set of values, goals or expectancies relating to the acquisition of wealth and material goods <ref type="bibr" coords="1,116.62,633.35,80.68,7.54" target="#b63">(Kasser &amp; Ryan, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,199.39,633.35,90.31,7.54" target="#b78">Richins &amp; Dawson, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Materialistic values are important to consider in relation to environmental attitudes and behavior for two reasons: first, there is considerable theoretical and empirical support that this particular value may be negatively related to environmental outcomes, and second, it is an individual difference which may be more readily influenced than personality variables. Furthermore, there is as yet no systematic review of the growing body of studies examining the association of materialism with environmental attitudes and behaviors. A meta-analysis can synthesize this literature and examine potential moderating factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Materialism, the environment and value systems</head><p>The fundamental opposition between the pursuit of economic success and pro-environmental behavior is a common theme. In 2005, President Bush cited the US economy as his primary reason for not signing the Kyoto agreement, and a recent survey found that a sizeable minority of Americans believed their country could not afford to reduce its impact on global warming given its struggling economy (43%; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,370.43,635.84,192.21,7.54;1,311.53,646.33,19.40,7.54" target="#b66">Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-Renouf, &amp; Hmielowski, 2012)</ref>. Others argue that the global and national pursuit of economic growth has placed substantial and unsustainable strain on the planet's resources <ref type="bibr" coords="1,380.81,667.25,63.31,7.54" target="#b36">(Hamilton, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,446.12,667.25,54.45,7.54" target="#b50">Jackson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,502.58,667.25,45.57,7.54" target="#b87">Speth, 2008)</ref>. At the individual level, materialism can be considered the personal endorsement of this national drive for economic growth and of the values of capitalism. Theory suggests <ref type="bibr" coords="1,450.25,698.66,112.33,7.54;1,311.53,709.09,22.12,7.54" target="#b60">(Kasser, Cohn, Kanner, &amp; Ryan, 2007)</ref> and studies show <ref type="bibr" coords="1,402.86,709.09,55.86,7.54" target="#b57">(Kasser, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,460.74,709.09,60.79,7.54" target="#b84">Schwartz, 2007)</ref> that to the extent nations pursue de-regulated, free-market forms of capitalism, their citizens are more likely to endorse values that concern wealth, social standing and competition between individuals. Further, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,63.84,98.12,54.62,7.54" target="#b58">Kasser (2011b)</ref> reported that countries whose citizens place relatively higher priority on these types of values (i.e., for Hierarchy and Mastery) also had higher levels of CO 2 emissions, providing empirical support for the claims of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.19,129.53,89.66,7.54">Speth and others (2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.53,129.53,30.38,7.54;2,32.82,139.96,17.79,7.54" target="#b50">Jackson, 2009</ref>) that the pursuit of economic success at a national level may contribute to environmental damage.</p><p>But even given these links between economic systems, values, and the environment at a national level, it is important to understand why the personal value of materialism might have negative associations with individual environmental attitudes and behaviors, similar to those reported at a national level. One possible explanation may be provided by research into value conflict, where studies have consistently shown that some personal values are compatible and associated, and some are in opposition <ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.86,234.12,32.99,7.54;2,32.82,244.55,48.04,7.54" target="#b30">(Grouzet et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,84.92,244.55,59.64,7.54" target="#b82">Schwartz, 1992)</ref>. These value structures are rather similar at both a national and individual level, lending further support to our extrapolation from the national to the individual <ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.82,275.96,59.95,7.54" target="#b82">(Schwartz, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,101.48,275.96,16.17,7.54" target="#b83">(Schwartz, , 2006</ref>). <ref type="bibr" coords="2,130.34,275.96,64.38,7.54" target="#b82">Schwartz's (1992</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,203.24,275.96,17.86,7.54" target="#b83">Schwartz's ( , 2006</ref> circumplex of values is a key demonstration of both of these findings, and has been validated on data from over 80 countries. In a circumplex model, values that are compatible are located adjacently, while those in conflict are located on opposite sides of the circumplex. Power and Achievement are adjacent values in this model, and fall directly opposite to the value of Universalism, which relates to valuing social justice, the environment and equality. This means that it is relatively difficult and uncommon for individuals to endorse both of these sets of values. As for materialism, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,244.74,370.13,39.13,7.54;2,32.82,380.56,87.56,7.54" target="#b8">Burroughs and Rindfleisch (2002)</ref> analyzed materialism measures alongside the Schwartz values, and found that materialism fell next to Power and Achievement, and opposite to Universalism. Further crosscultural research <ref type="bibr" coords="2,102.38,411.97,85.85,7.54" target="#b30">(Grouzet et al., 2005)</ref> has found that materialism consistently falls with other self-interested values, in opposition to values that may be associated with environmental concern. Interestingly, experimental work by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,225.47,443.32,58.40,7.54;2,32.82,453.80,98.73,7.54" target="#b69">Maio, Pakizeh, Cheung, and Rees (2009)</ref> shows that there is a dual process at work here, suggesting that materialistic values could have a doubly negative impact on environmental outcomes: priming related and environmentally detrimental values, such as Power, simultaneously increases their rated importance and decreases the importance rating given to the opposing value of Universalism, which is positively associated with environmental behavior. Evidence supporting this conflict between self-interested values, such as materialism, on the one hand and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors on the other, as well as the strong association of pro-environmental and altruistic values, can also be seen outside of this values conflict literature. Research into domain-specific, environmental values has also suggested an association between prosocial concerns and concern for the environment. Specifically, studies have found strong links between ecospheric and altruistic environmental values, with some exploratory factor analyses yielding a single factor composed of the items from both these scales <ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.82,631.59,92.02,7.54" target="#b20">(De Groot &amp; Steg, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,127.89,631.59,99.86,7.54" target="#b73">Nordlund &amp; Garvill, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,230.79,631.59,53.08,7.54;2,32.82,642.08,21.26,7.54" target="#b89">Stern &amp; Dietz, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,56.29,642.08,206.69,7.54" target="#b93">Swami, Chamorro-Premuzic, Snelgar, &amp; Furnham, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, environmental crises have frequently been characterized by environmental psychologists as social, or commons, dilemmas <ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.90,673.49,52.64,7.54" target="#b37">(Hardin, 1968)</ref>. In such crises, there is a clear personal benefit to consuming more, or 'defecting', but if all involved were to behave this way, the overall outcome would be less beneficial than if all 'cooperated' and reduced their consumption to sustainable levels. Research using commons dilemma paradigms has found interesting results relating to pro-social behavior, further supporting the suggestion that environmental and altruistic values are closely related (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,320.20,66.76,133.15,7.54" target="#b65">Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick, 2002</ref>, for a full review). These studies suggest that people with pro-social, as opposed to pro-self, orientations behave more cooperatively and harvest less in environmental resource dilemmas, but also that participants with higher levels of environmental concern behave more pro-socially in general, both in real life situations and in simulated commons dilemmas that are not directly related to the environment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,457.74,129.52,79.31,7.54" target="#b51">(Kaiser &amp; Byrka, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,538.30,129.52,14.67,7.54;2,301.83,139.95,43.91,7.54" target="#b97">Van Lange, 1999)</ref>. These findings provide further evidence that pro-social and environmental values may be related, whereas self-interest runs in conflict with these aims. Therefore, if, as <ref type="bibr" coords="2,373.55,171.36,72.31,7.54">Maio et al.'s (2009)</ref> work suggests, materialistic values have the ability to decrease the importance individuals place on the positively associated, pro-social value of Universalism, and at the same time increase the importance of the environmentally damaging values of Power and Achievement, they have further potential to be a strong and negative influence on environmental attitudes and behaviors at the individual level, by reducing prosocial tendencies as well as pro-environmental ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Goal pursuit behavior</head><p>Another reason for expecting an association between materialism and environmental behaviors in particular is that different behaviors stem from different values or goals. The purchase of 'ethical' goods, such as fair-trade foods, has been associated positively with the Schwartz value of Universalism, and negatively with Power <ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.91,338.72,46.31,7.54" target="#b22">(Doran, 2009</ref>). If our values can influence what type of item we buy, they may also influence how environmentally damaging our purchases or behaviors are. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.24,359.64,93.74,7.54" target="#b7">Brown and Kasser (2005)</ref> argue that individuals pursuing intrinsic goals, such as personal growth, close relationships with family, and community well-being, are likely to engage in less harmful environmental behavior simply because these goals are not dependent on material goods or wealth for fulfillment. In contrast, pursuit of the materialistic goals of financial success, image and fame is grounded in conspicuous consumption and the accumulation of high status goods, such as sports cars with low fuel economy or high energy widescreen televisions; by necessity, pursuit of the materialistic 'dream' involves an increased negative impact on the environment, whereas the pursuit of selffulfillment and connection to others does not.</p><p>From the different literature outlined above, it becomes clear that materialistic values may have an association with environmental behavior and attitudes that is worth considering in more detail. Although a brief glance at the available research would suggest that materialism is indeed negatively associated with environmental behaviors and attitudes, there is considerable variation between studies, both in effect sizes and in the measures used. A meta-analysis will allow a synthesis of the studies available, and enable us to consider the 'true' correlation between materialism and environmental outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Potential moderators</head><p>An additional benefit of a meta-analysis is that it enables the consideration of potential moderators that might be difficult to assess within a single study. Identifying moderator variables is important, as doing so helps determine the conditions under which materialism is most influential on people's environmental behavior and thus who might benefit most from any interventions. Previous research into environmental concern highlights two potential individual level moderators. Specifically, studies have suggested effects for gender and age on environmental concern and attitudes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,338.23,715.33,84.57,7.54" target="#b26">(Ewert &amp; Baker, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,425.76,715.33,71.31,7.54" target="#b93">Swami et al., 2010)</ref>, with women and older participants exhibiting more pro-environmental attitudes. It is possible that these differences may also have an influence on the link between materialism and environmental outcomes.</p><p>Elements of the studies themselves may also influence the size of effect found between materialism and environmental attitudes and behaviors. Year of publication is a potentially interesting moderator, as it may provide insight into changes in environmental views over the years. If, overall, environmental attitudes and behaviors have improved over time and become more similar across the population, we might expect that the association with materialism could also decrease, as the variability in environmental scores limits the size of the correlation. Another study-level moderator could be the population from which the sample is drawn. Research often relies on student samples, as they are a convenient and accessible population, but previous work has found that student samples are often more homogeneous than community samples, with effect sizes from student samples often differing in both size and direction from those found in community samples <ref type="bibr" coords="3,255.79,234.12,37.75,7.54;3,42.52,244.55,19.92,7.54" target="#b74">(Peterson, 2001)</ref>. As such, a consideration of the differences between student and community samples could be important for the progression of future research.</p><p>A final moderator of interest is whether environmental behaviors or environmental attitudes are more strongly associated with materialism. Models relating attitudes to behavior, such as the theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="3,169.34,307.37,48.58,7.54" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, typically take the form of values influencing attitudes, which then inform behavior. Under such models we would expect a stronger association between materialism and attitudes than between materialism and behaviors. However, as outlined in Section 1.2, the link between materialism and environmental behavior more be more direct, and not simply occur through a joint association with attitudes. By establishing the strength of materialism's association with both attitudes and behaviors, we can begin to consider the multiple ways in which materialism might be linked with environmental outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">The present study</head><p>The overall aim of the present study was to provide a synthesis of the research currently available linking materialistic values and goals with environmental attitudes and behaviors. We conducted a multivariate meta-analysis to assess the magnitude of the link between materialism and these constructs, assessing associations with behavior separately from attitudes to allow comparisons between the strength of the link with each outcome. Materialism was expected to be negatively associated with both proenvironmental attitudes and behaviors, in line with the theoretical predictions outlined above. We also aimed to consider potential moderators of the link between materialism and environmental outcomes by assessing how the size of the association varied depending on the proportions of female participants, mean age of participants, year of publication, population type, and the type of environmental outcome measured (behavior or attitude). In addition to these empirical goals, we aimed to locate and highlight gaps in the existing literature in order to guide future research. By assessing not just the research available, but the answers it could not provide, we hoped to be able to suggest new areas of research that might be particularly fruitful for understanding this link.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Literature search and inclusion criteria</head><p>We used four strategies to locate reports of relevant studies. First, we searched the online databases PsychInfo, Web of Knowledge, and Index to Theses by pairing a materialism search term with an environmental search term using the Boolean AND operator. Examples of materialism search terms are materialism, material values and financial success, 1 and for environmental search terms we used environment*, the asterisk signifying a wild card. Databases were searched up to 30th September 2010 and we stopped taking unpublished datasets on 31st December 2010. Secondly, we conducted ancestor searches by scrutinizing the reference lists of review articles and the reports located from our database searches. Third, we carried out a descendency search by checking for articles citing materialism papers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,356.71,171.36,75.19,7.54">Kasser &amp; Ryan,1993)</ref> using Web of Knowledge. Fourth, we wrote to 21 prominent researchers in the field of materialism requesting any unpublished work; this resulted in one unpublished masters dissertation that provided two samples for the analysis.</p><p>In order to be included, the report had to include at least one study in which there was a measure of materialism and a measure of environmental attitudes or behavior, and in which either the zero-order correlation between these measures was directly reported or there was sufficient information to derive or closely estimate that correlation (see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,415.79,265.47,131.22,7.54">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001, Appendix B)</ref>. All reports except two that we located had sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis; we wrote to both of these authors requesting the zero-order correlations and were successful in contacting one of these. Of the reports that did provide the required information, only one necessitated the calculation of the zero-order correlation from summary data <ref type="bibr" coords="3,433.13,328.29,125.28,7.54" target="#b15">(Clump, Brandel, &amp; Sharpe, 2002)</ref>; all other reports included the zero-order correlations.</p><p>Given that this meta-analysis defined materialism as individual differences in people's long-term endorsement of values, goals, and associated beliefs that center on the importance of acquiring money and possessions that convey status, we excluded studies examining beliefs about the goals a society should pursue (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,503.83,391.05,58.73,7.54" target="#b47">Inglehart, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,311.53,401.48,136.92,7.54" target="#b48">Inglehart, Basanez, &amp; Moreno, 1998)</ref>, or attitudes towards money that did not match this materialistic outlook (e.g., the importance of budgeting money, from Tang, Luna-Arocas, Sutarso, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,508.08,422.40,50.44,7.54" target="#b95">&amp; Tang, 2004)</ref>. The majority of reports utilized the Aspiration Index (AI, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,529.68,432.88,32.85,7.54;3,311.53,443.32,45.52,7.54" target="#b63">Kasser &amp; Ryan, 1996)</ref>, the Materialistic Values Scale (MVS, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,523.33,443.32,39.20,7.54;3,311.53,453.80,53.81,7.54" target="#b78">Richins &amp; Dawson, 1992)</ref>, or a derivative of one of these measures (e.g., the MVS short version; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.42,464.24,52.92,7.54" target="#b77">Richins, 2004)</ref>. We decided to treat these as similar measures and analyze the data in combination, as previous research has shown that these measures are strongly correlated <ref type="bibr" coords="3,311.53,495.64,90.98,7.54" target="#b59">(Kasser &amp; Ahuvia, 2002)</ref>. Furthermore, these scales are similar in their interpretation of materialism, as they measure not only the importance placed on money but also on associated values and beliefs such as status or image.</p><p>For environmental behavior, we included any measure that assessed behaviors with specific environmental impacts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Coding of studies</head><p>Our dataset was hierarchically structured with the research reports identified from the literature search, such as journal articles, book chapters or theses, at the highest level. Some of these reported more than one study, so the study was the next level, nested within report. A study could include more than one sample so, where possible, we coded effects separately for different samples in order to investigate possible moderators of effect size. Thus, we treated each sample as our independent unit of analysis, but these may be nested within study and in turn nested within report. Also, each sample could include multiple effect sizes, given that several materialism or environmental measures may have been used. We coded all of these correlations, although in Section 2.3 (Data Analysis) we discuss how we dealt with several correlations from a single sample. As necessary, correlations were reverse scored so that a negative correlation always indicated that higher materialism was associated with less concern for protecting the natural environment or with less pro-environmental behaviors.</p><p>For each correlation, we recorded the sample size for that effect size (N), the materialism measure, the environmental measure, and the reliability of each of these when this information was reported. For the purposes of moderation analyses, we recorded, where possible: (a) percent female respondents; (b) mean age of the sample (or, if not available, age group); (c) the publication year of the report; and (d) the population type (student or community sample). We also coded the study design, data collection method and type of publication (e.g., journal article, book chapter, thesis or unpublished report) in our coding, but found that our database included crosssectional questionnaire studies only, and overwhelmingly published journal articles (there was one unpublished masters thesis), preventing moderator analyses with these variables. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,229.55,497.51,3.56,5.66">2</ref> This coding approach was developed as part of a larger metaanalysis of materialism and its correlates.

The I 2 statistic quantifies the proportion of the total variance due to variability in study effect size and, as is shown in <ref type="table" coords="7,514.26,397.57,27.03,7.54" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, this proportion is high for environmental attitudes, but a good deal lower for environmental behaviors. This difference is most likely due to one positive correlation between materialism and environmental attitudes (Unanue, 2010, Chilean sample), in strong contrast to the trend of negative effect sizes. For both attitudes and  behaviors, the 95% confidence interval does not include 0, and thus the average effect size is significantly different from zero at the .05 level. The confidence interval and the 80% credibility interval for the corrected correlation both indicate at least a small effect, but one that could be medium to large. There is, however, heterogeneity in the size of the correlation in the population of studies, suggesting the importance of looking for moderators of the size of correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Moderator analysis</head><p>Given this heterogeneity, we extended the analysis to include moderator variables. In addition to the moderators reported in <ref type="table" coords="8,32.83,472.18,25.75,7.54" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>, there were several other variables that we coded because they might be expected to moderate the effect size; unfortunately, an insufficient number of studies reported enough relevant information to enable us to conduct these moderator analyses. Specifically, few studies provided any data that might be used to estimate the socio-economic status of the participants, with only two reporting personal income or the educational attainment of the sample. 8 Percentage of white participants was recorded by only three studies, all of which reported figures in the 90e100% range, demonstrating either a limited consideration of ethnicity by researchers or poor reporting of this demographic information. Additionally, with the exception of a single sample from Chile (Unanue, 2010), the samples came from Westernized, Anglo countries (UK, USA, Australia), thus preventing any assessment of variation between countries on potentially relevant indices such as country-level wealth or values. We were, however, able to assess the potential moderating effect of the year of publication (ranging from 1992 to 2010), the percentage of women participants in the sample (which ranged from 44 to 78 percent), the mean age of participants (which ranged from 14 to 45 years), and the population from which the sample was drawn (student or community) on both the relationship between materialism and environmental attitudes and the relationship between materialism and environmental behaviors. We found no evidence that the relationship between materialism and either attitudes or behaviors was moderated by percentage of women participants or by the mean age of participants (ps &gt; .05). For year of publication, we found contrasting results for attitudes and behaviors: the relationship between environmental attitudes and materialism was less negative the more recently the study was published (b ¼ .02, p &lt; .05), whereas the relationship between environmental behaviors and materialism was not affected by publication year. 9 For the contrast between studies using student samples vs. those using community samples, we found a significant moderation of the relationship between materialism and environmental attitudes, with community samples showing a weaker negative link between materialism and environmental attitudes than student samples (b ¼ À.27, p &lt; .05). For environmental behaviors, we found the opposite: community samples showed a stronger negative link compared to student samples (b ¼ .15, p &lt; .05).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Our analyses clearly demonstrate that materialism is negatively associated with both pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Materialists are less likely to believe that humans need to change their behavior to protect the environment and are more likely to engage in higher levels of environmentally-damaging behavior themselves. These relationships are not moderated by either gender or age, the two participant variables we considered. Thus, it seems that materialistic values are equally damaging to the environment regardless of who endorses them, and that materialists may represent a particularly important-to-reach, but relatively obstinate, population: the more materialistic people are, the worse their environmental behavior is likely to be, but the less likely they are to believe that the world is in danger and that they should alter their behavior to protect the environment.</p><p>The similarity of the effect sizes for environmental attitudes and behaviors is noteworthy. If materialism's association with environmental behavior is due solely to the two constructs' joint links with attitudes, it would be reasonable to expect a smaller correlation of materialism with behaviors than with attitudes. The fact that the correlation of materialism with behaviors is not significantly smaller than that with attitudes provides tentative evidence that materialism has a direct association with environmental behavior, possibly through differences in the goal pursuit behaviors of materialists and non-materialists, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="9,224.44,673.49,69.11,7.54;9,42.52,683.92,23.30,7.54" target="#b7">Brown and Kasser (2005)</ref>. Future research could clarify this by including measures of both environmental behaviors and attitudes and performing mediation analyses. This finding in particular not only has interesting theoretical implications, but important practical ones for environmental charities and agencies hoping to use public information campaigns to prevent environmental crises. At present, many campaigns revolve around increasing awareness of specific issues (e.g., "The greatest wonder of the sea is that it's still alive", Greenpeace) or emphasizing the responsibility of individuals to engage in specific behaviors (e.g., "If you don't preserve nature by using low wattage light bulbs, who will?", EDF Energy). Our findings suggest that materialists are simultaneously engaging in more damaging behaviors whilst not believing there to be a need to change these behaviors, meaning that they may be even less responsive to these messages of awareness and responsibility than the rest of the population. The suggestion from the results that materialistic values may be linked directly to environmental behaviors raises the possibility of different kinds of campaigns aimed at reducing materialistic values, which could be beneficial for a range of environmental and social causes (see <ref type="bibr" coords="9,487.33,369.39,58.20,7.54" target="#b19">Crompton, 2010</ref>, for an overview of such values-based campaigning). Support for the benefits of such values-based campaigns can be found in recent experimental research where priming intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, values resulted in higher levels of concern for global problems, more willingness to take personal responsibility, and better ecological policy recommendations <ref type="bibr" coords="9,484.95,432.15,77.68,7.54;9,311.53,442.64,113.99,7.54" target="#b13">(Chilton, Crompton, Kasser, Maio, &amp; Nolan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,429.56,442.64,129.20,7.54" target="#b86">Sheldon, Nichols, &amp; Kasser, 2011)</ref>. Strikingly, the <ref type="bibr" coords="9,370.77,453.07,81.34,7.54" target="#b13">Chilton et al. (2012)</ref> study specifically recruited extrinsically-oriented, or materialistic, participants, highlighting the promise of values-based campaigns even among those with the most environmentally damaging values.</p><p>The lack of a moderating effect on the relationship between materialism and environmental measures by the mean age of the samples may initially seem surprising given the rising prominence of environmental concerns in recent years. However, it is worth considering the restricted range of age in these samples before drawing any firm conclusions. The studies in our analysis were by and large lacking older cohorts, as the range of mean sample ages varied from 14 to 45. It may therefore be beneficial for future research to consider the association between materialism and environmental attitudes and behaviors in older age groups.</p><p>The effect of population type (student or community) on the relationship of materialism to environmental attitudes and behaviors is a difficult one to explain. This finding is potentially important, given that many psychological studies use university students as a proxy for the population at large; our findings suggest that generalizability may be not be a good assumption, as the correlation of materialism with both of the environmental outcomes varied considerably between students and community samples. That said, it is important to note that of the 17 effect sizes of materialism with environmental attitudes and behaviors, only four of these came from non-student samples, and two of these were from the only sample from a non-Western country (Unanue, 2010, Chilean sample); one of these effect sizes also happens to be the only positive effect size between materialism and attitudes. Note. Population variable is dummy coded as 0 ¼ community sample, 1 ¼ student sample. Some confidence intervals for significant effects may appear to include zero due to rounding. Moderator estimates marked with * are significant.</p><p>As such, it may be that the reported moderating effect of student vs. community samples is actually due to some other confounding factor concerning culture.</p><p>Publication year also moderated the size of the correlation between materialism and environmental attitudes, but not behaviors: the correlation between materialism and attitudes becomes less negative the more recently a study was published. Perhaps consensus has grown in the global community concerning the reality of climate change and other environmental crises to such an extent that even people scoring high in materialism find it difficult (though not impossible) to deny this reality when questioned about it in an environmental attitudes survey: if this is so, it would result in reduced variability in environmental attitudes across the samples, leaving less variance for materialist values to explain. In contrast to these results for attitudes, it appears that materialism's association with negative environmental behaviors has not weakened over time. Such a pattern is difficult to reconcile, but again suggests the importance of considering the many ways that attitudes and behaviors are not consistently associated with each other. However, these conclusions should be treated quite tentatively, given that the relatively small size of our sample makes it vulnerable to the influence of outliers: a single large effect size from an early or late study could have easily influenced the results of this analysis.</p><p>When we adjusted for the reliability of the materialism and environmental measures in order to calculate a 'true' effect size, the magnitude of the correlations between materialism and both environmental attitudes and environmental behaviors increased considerably. This adjustment is important for two reasons. First, it takes both correlations from small-medium to medium size (À.22 to À.29, and À.24 to À.32). In the context of other individual traits and environmental attitudes and behaviors, such as the Big Five personality traits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="10,122.51,391.05,85.33,7.54" target="#b70">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1989)</ref>, these materialism effect sizes are considerably larger than the effect sizes associated with personality traits, which tend to vary between a small to small-medium effect size, when they are present at all (À.10 to À.20; e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="10,88.84,432.88,47.95,7.54" target="#b43">Hirsh, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,141.22,432.88,92.28,7.54" target="#b71">Milfont &amp; Sibley, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,237.94,432.88,45.94,7.54;10,32.83,443.32,51.57,7.54" target="#b102">Wiseman &amp; Bogner, 2003)</ref>. Such a comparative result suggests that materialistic values and goals are relatively strong individual predictors of environmental attitudes and behaviors. The true size of the correlations provides further support for the potential for increasing pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors by targeting materialistic values and goals, as not only does materialism appear to be more strongly associated with these variables than are other individual differences, but it is also potentially more malleable: whereas personality traits are relatively stable variables that are difficult to change, materialism is an individual difference that can be successfully decreased, as has been demonstrated in two experimental studies with children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" coords="10,242.07,558.40,41.81,7.54;10,32.83,568.83,43.49,7.54" target="#b9">(Chaplin &amp; John, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,78.86,568.83,68.87,7.54" target="#b61">Kasser et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>This leap in the reliability-adjusted coefficient is also important because it reveals that the environmental measures used in the research studies we included have less-than-optimal reliabilities, which leads to underestimations of the actual correlation between these environmental measures and other variables. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,232.16,621.16,51.74,7.54;10,32.83,631.59,61.45,7.54" target="#b38">Hawcroft and Milfont's (2010)</ref> meta-analysis of the use of the NEP also highlighted this problem with reliability, reporting that over half of their 139 studies did not report reliability, and those that did had surprisingly low reliabilities, with a mean alpha of only .68. An important goal for environmental research in general could therefore be to develop scales with higher reliabilities so as to more accurately estimate the size of associations between these measures and other variables of interest.</p><p>Another finding from <ref type="bibr" coords="10,135.33,715.33,121.14,7.54" target="#b38">Hawcroft and Milfont's (2010)</ref> metaanalysis of the NEP mirrored in our research was that reporting of important demographic variables was often poor or non-existent:</p><p>Hawcroft and Milfont found that almost a third of their 139 studies failed to report even basic demographic descriptive statistics such as mean age or sample gender composition for their samples. Although the basic demographic details were better reported in the studies we included in this meta-analysis, only two studies reported income or level of education. These variables are important to consider as both have previously been associated with differing levels of willingness to make personal sacrifices for the environment and of engagement in pro-environmental behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="10,301.83,160.87,129.39,7.54" target="#b14">(Clark, Kotchen, &amp; Moore, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,435.74,160.87,117.11,7.54;10,301.83,171.36,20.11,7.54" target="#b64">Kemmelmeier, Krol, &amp; Young, 2002)</ref>, and thus could be potential moderators of the relationship between materialism and both environmental attitudes and behaviors. However, with so few studies reporting these variables, it was unfortunately not possible to assess the potential moderation of the link between materialism and the environmental measures by income or education in our sample of studies. Therefore it may be worthwhile for researchers in this field to ensure that they record these variables so future meta-analyses can consider such effects.</p><p>The composition of our dataset also highlights the dearth of cross-cultural research in this area. In our collection of studies, we found only one sample from a non-developed, non-Western country: a masters dissertation that had collected data from Chilean participants (Unanue, 2010). With little variation in where our samples came from, it was not possible to assess country-level differences in the link between materialism and environmental outcomes, but the data from our Chilean sample suggest the importance of considering other areas of the world, as, for these Chilean participants, materialism had a non-significant association with environmental attitudes. Although this is only one sample from one country, these results highlight the possibility that materialism and environmental outcomes may not be as conflicting as theory and evidence from Western developed countries suggests. This is particularly interesting as previous research has found that nations with lower GDP and lower scores on the Human Development Index (HDI) have citizens with reduced levels of willingness to make sacrifices for the environment <ref type="bibr" coords="10,491.13,443.31,61.71,7.54;10,301.84,453.80,20.11,7.54" target="#b34">(Haller &amp; Hadler, 2008)</ref>. Chile, with a GDP of approximately USD 14,000 and a HDI (excluding income) score of .862 (World Bank, n.d.; United Nations Development Programme, n.d.), ranks considerably lower on both of these indicators than do the other countries included in the meta-analysis (UK, USA, and Australia), and yet the relationship between materialism and environmental attitudes was not negative there. If this non-significant finding was replicated across several other countries, it could call into question the universality of the idea so predominant in Western thought that personal and national economic growth are at odds with protecting the environment.</p><p>It may, in fact, be the case that materialistic values have a different meaning in less developed countries. Research on income and well-being has shown that higher levels of country-level income have a greater effect in increasing subjective well-being among poorer countries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="10,419.64,610.67,133.18,7.54;10,301.84,621.16,20.11,7.54" target="#b49">Inglehart, Foa, Peterson, &amp; Welzel, 2008)</ref>. It may be that the pursuit of additional wealth by individuals within these countries, perhaps spurred in part by personal materialistic values, may be positively related to important well-being factors, such as the satisfaction of basic psychological needs. This, in turn, may have a consequent effect on environmental behavior and attitudes for individuals in these countries. Future research should consider expanding to encompass a wider range of countries so that it is possible to more fully understand the link between materialistic values and environmental outcomes. However, our finding that materialistic values and environmental outcomes are associated in these three developed countries is still important, even if it is found to be the case that it is not replicated in less developed countries: <ref type="bibr" coords="11,143.77,66.77,48.39,7.54" target="#b88">Stern (2007)</ref> reports that OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation &amp; Development) countries consume on average eight times as much energy per capita as do developing countries in Africa and Asia. Given the environmental and political power of the wealthier countries, understanding factors associated with environmental attitudes and behaviors of their citizens may be critical in reducing environmental harm in coming years.</p><p>A final suggestion for future research is that researchers might consider more closely the components of their environmental attitude measures. Upon close consideration of the items included within these measures in our sample of studies, this super-ordinate category is more varied than would be ideal. There are clearly different types of attitudinal items, but individual scales often combined these types of items. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,173.48,213.20,120.07,7.54" target="#b38">Hawcroft and Milfont's (2010)</ref> meta-analysis of the NEP highlights this as a problem in the case of the NEP, which is often used as a single measure without validating its purported unidimensionality. These combinations of highly varied items may be partially responsible for the poor reliabilities mentioned earlier in this section, but they also prevent a full understanding of precisely how materialism is related to environmental attitudes. Several scales, for example, include items measuring a belief in the existence of a 'trade off' between the environment and the economy, mirroring the common concept that protecting the environment will cost humans economically and reduce quality of life. Very few studies separate these items from the main attitude scale, but the two studies that did provide separate correlations for these specific trade-off items <ref type="bibr" coords="11,249.45,349.21,44.13,7.54;11,42.52,359.64,59.58,7.54" target="#b1">(Banerjee &amp; McKeage, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,105.11,359.64,105.07,7.54" target="#b45">Hodgkinson &amp; Innes, 2000)</ref> demonstrated higher correlations between materialism and these items than between materialism and the overall scale, 10 raising the possibility that it is these particular attitudes that drive the association between materialism and environmental attitudes. There are other distinct sets of items within the literature, such as items relating to denial of environmental threats or nature's purpose in supporting humanity, that may provide support for other explanations of the link between materialism and environmental attitudes, such as materialists holding objectifying views of the environment <ref type="bibr" coords="11,240.26,453.81,53.31,7.54" target="#b55">(Kasser, 2002)</ref> or denying environmental crises in a defensive response to reduce feelings of guilt due to their lifestyle. It is of course unlikely that only one of these processes linking materialism and environmental attitudes is occurring, but greater consideration by researchers in this area of the scales they use, and how they analyze particular items within them, would help in disentangling the web of potential processes.</p><p>In sum, the limitations of this meta-analysis reflect in part the limitations of the literature available, as outlined above. Due to the correlational nature of the research, we cannot draw any conclusions from our mean effect sizes about causality. These findings may only be applicable to the countries from which samples were available and can provide only a rough outline of the associations due to the lack of reported moderator variables and undivided environmental attitude scales.</p><p>Another particularly important limitation that deserves consideration is the issue of the nature of environmental behavior measures used by the reports we sampled. All the measures included were either self-reported behaviors or in the case of one effect size, self-reported behavioral intentions. The lack of objective behavioral measures is important, as the discrepancy between self-report and objective measures of environmental behavior is a well-documented phenomenon <ref type="bibr" coords="11,364.48,98.11,85.42,7.54" target="#b18">(Corral-Verdugo, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,452.86,98.11,109.71,7.54" target="#b28">Fuji, Hennessy, &amp; Mak, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,311.53,108.60,59.45,7.54" target="#b35">Hamilton, 1985)</ref>. Beliefs about re-using and recycling have been more strongly linked to self-report measures of these behaviors than to objective measures <ref type="bibr" coords="11,398.38,129.52,83.97,7.54" target="#b18">(Corral-Verdugo, 1997)</ref>, and it may be that materialism similarly shares a stronger link with self-reported proenvironmental behavior than with actual behavior. As with the other limitations of our work, this missing knowledge highlights the importance of future work investigating whether materialism is as strongly linked to objective measures of environmental behavior.</p><p>In spite of its limitations however, we hope that this metaanalysis is a significant step in bringing together the literature on materialistic values and their links with environmental attitudes and behaviors, and in highlighting areas where more research needs to be done in this particular field, and in that of environmental psychology more generally. Additionally, we hope that the strength of this link between materialism and environmental outcomes may provide a new way for researchers to increase proenvironmental attitudes and behaviors by targeting the pernicious value of materialism.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,301.83,282.69,250.98,6.03;6,301.83,291.16,66.41,6.38"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Distribution of correlations between materialism and environmental attitudes and behavior (k ¼ 26).</figDesc></figure>
