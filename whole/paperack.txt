addition to securing direct benefits, advocacy organizations have aggregate effects and can systemically change the culture of policy arenas.', 'Disease advocacy reshaped funding distributions, changed the perceived beneficiaries of policies, promoted metrics for commensuration, and made cultural categories of worth increasingly relevant to policymaking.', 'During the past 30 years, people with serious diseases have raised their political voices to an unprecedented degree, organizing to demand funding for research on their conditions.', "Previous studies of advocacy's political effects have focused narrowly on achievement of benefits for constituents, but I show that advocacy can produce two additional types of political outcomes, which I call distributive and systemic effects.", 'Using data on 53 diseases over 19 years, I find that diseases with the most organized patients secured dramatic increases in research funding.', 'I find suggestive evidence that diseases affecting primarily women and blacks tend to have lower levels of advocacy, so as disease advocacy became increasingly influential, the funding distribution shifted away from those diseases.', 'Finally, the rise of disease advocacy encouraged policymakers to think of research funding as a benefit given to patients with various diseases.', 'Once patients, rather than scientists or the public at large, were thought of as the primary beneficiaries of medical research funding, their perceived moral worthiness became increasingly relevant to funding decisions.', "Before the 1980s, disease patients' advocates rarely participated in the politics of federal medical research funding.", 'Although some groups pushed for creation of new institutes at the NIH, few lobbied Congress about the distribution of NIH funds to specific diseases (Dresser 2001).', '1 Inspired by the successes of the AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and breast cancer movements, they lobbied Congress for medical research funding to an unprecedented degree, making competitive claims for a greater share of NIH funding (Anglin 1997;Dresser 1999).', "We know relatively little, however, about disease advocacy's effects on the politics of medical research funding.", 'Simultaneously, a growing literature explores the determinants of NIH funding but does not measure the influence of advocacy (Gross, Anderson, and Powe 1999;Hegde 2009).', '3 This study is the first to analyze longitudinal data on the emergence of disease movements and also the first to demonstrate how disease advocacy affected medical research funding priority-setting.', 'Studying multiple diseases over time provides an ideal test of whether movements can secure direct benefits for their constituents.', 'Sampling 53 diseases over 19 years gives my analyses more statistical power and allows for more conclusive tests of whether advocacy organizations obtain direct benefits.', 'I draw on these unique features of my data to test whether disease advocates secured increased medical research funding.', 'When advocacy organizations enter a political arena and begin receiving direct benefits, the distribution of resources shifts to favor the type of people who are most likely to organize.', 'Alternatively, if socially advantaged people mobilize more, then advocacy organizations will tend to skew the distribution of benefits toward advantaged groups (Edwards and McCarthy 2004;Hacker and Pierson 2010;Schattschneider 1960;Schlozman et al. 2007).', "I use the term distributive changes to describe these aggregate consequences of multiple groups' achievement of direct benefits.", "As disease advocacy expanded, some researchers hoped it would challenge inequitable funding distributions and direct resources toward minorities' and women's diseases (Callahan 2003), while others worried it would draw funds away from these groups (Dresser 1999).", 'Other studies document biases in mobilization without determining whether they lead to distributive effects on policy, in part because it is difficult to systematically classify policies by who benefits from them.', 'Collecting data on multiple diseases over time allows me to track changes in the funding distribution.', "And because diseases can be classified by patients' race and gender, I can track whether the emergence of disease advocacy shifted funding to or from diseases that primarily affect minorities and women.", "Advocacy organizations tend to promote metrics for comparison that favor their causes, and if policymakers adopt an organization's preferred metric, the organization will likely receive direct benefits.", 'I will show that as some disease advocates promoted dollars per death as a way to commensurate diseases, NIH funding for all diseases drifted toward this standard.', '8 I will show that Congress formerly thought of scientists and the public at large as the main beneficiaries of medical research funding, but disease advocates encouraged Congress to think of disease patients as beneficiaries.', 'Once patients were considered beneficiaries, their perceived moral worthiness was increasingly relevant to funding decision-making, which disadvantaged stigmatized diseases.', 'For each disease in each year, I collected data on the amount of federal medical research funding for the disease, advocacy targeting the disease, and the number and characteristics of people it killed.', 'The dependent variable is federal medical research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense-Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (DOD-CDMRP).', 'In the United States, the NIH is the primary public funder of medical research, and the DOD-CDMRP also distributes a substantial amount of medical research funding.', '10 I used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain historical information on NIH research funding.', 'DOD-CDMRP funding data were available online.', 'I converted the funding totals into millions of 1987 dollars using the CPI-URS (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2008).', 'To measure participation of disease advocacy organizations in NIH funding deliberations, I collected data on witnesses at House appropriations hearings for Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education, which include NIH appropriations.', 'I began by using absolute funding levels as the dependent variable and including a lagged measure of funding in the regression equation.', 'Therefore, I first-differenced the dependent variable, yielding models that predict changes in research funding.', 'If advocacy organizations received direct benefits, we should observe positive coefficients for the advocacy variables, indicating that diseases with more advocacy had bigger funding increases.', 'If advocacy created distributive changes on the basis of race and gender, we should see race and gender coefficients that are mediated by advocacy, indicating that different levels of mobilization shifted the funding distribution across demographic groups.', 'These changed terms of the debate should affect how all diseases fare in the competition for funds.', 'Scholars have argued that disease advocates successfully lobbied for research funds Dresser 1999;Epstein 1996).', '27 The results reveal a strong relationship between advocacy and funding changes.', 'Increases in the number of nonprofits and lobbying expenditures are both significantly associated with increases in research funding, with each $1,000 spent on lobbying associated with a $25,000 increase in research funds the following year.', '28 These findings suggest that disease advocacy organizations secured direct benefits in the form of increased medical research funding.', 'Contemporary observers made competing predictions about how advocacy might affect the overall distribution of research funding.', 'Some scholars and advocates argued that disease advocacy would correct inequities, shifting funds to diseases that disproportionately affect women and racial minorities.', 'The results tentatively support the latter prediction.', "Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant, suggesting that women's and blacks' diseases tended to receive smaller funding increases.", "The coefficient for blacks' diseases decreases significantly, indicating that low levels of advocacy explain some of the funding disparities.", "Thus far, I have shown that disease advocates secured large funding increases, and that these successes may have created funding disparities on the basis of patients' race and gender.", 'Turning to systemic effects, I find that disease advocates changed the political meaning of medical research, with profound consequences for the distribution of research funds.', 'Seeking increased funding for their diseases, many advocates argued that NIH funding was out of sync with the burden of disease.', 'Mortality emerged as an influential metric for commensurating diseases and reshaped the funding distribution.', "Following AIDS advocacy's successes in the 1980s, HIV/AIDS received more research funding than any other disease.", 'These funding levels meant advocates for virtually every disease could use measures of dollars per death or per patient to claim their disease was underfunded compared to HIV/AIDS.', 'In 1995, a representative of the American Heart Association noted that "in fiscal year 1993, HHS spent 36 times more on research funding per death of an AIDS victim than was spent per death of a heart disease victim" (U.S. Congress 1995:129).', 'Policymakers liked mortality and prevalence metrics because they came from official government statistics and provided a simple and seemingly rational way to compare funding across diseases (see Porter 1995).', "In the House, Representatives Istook (R-OK) and Nethercutt (R-WA) echoed advocates' claims that some diseases were underfunded compared to HIV/AIDS, a point Istook pushed in appropriations subcommittee meetings (Dresser 1999;Istook 1997;Marshall 1997).", 'These dollars-per-death claims created political pressure to standardize the NIH funding process.', 'A Congressional Research Service report complained that advocates tended to choose the comparisons most favorable to their own diseases, offering up a "vast and sometimes confusing array of charts and tables comparing disease-specific research funding with statistics on morbidity, mortality, and health care costs" (Johnson 1998).', "In response to advocates' various metrics and standards, some members of Congress began requesting reports of NIH funding by mortality.", "In 1994, the Senate appropriations committee ordered the NIH to submit a report of funding by death rates, medical spending, and diseases' indirect economic costs (Agnew 1996).", 'That same year, the Congressional Research Service produced a report of NIH funding and mortality rates for the leading causes of death (Johnson 1994).', 'At the Senate hearing, NIH director Harold Varmus argued that diseases are inappropriate categories for judging the funding distribution and opposed formal commensuration as a priority-setting tool.', 'He testified that it would be foolhardy to set funding targets by diseases because medical advances often arise from non-disease-targeted basic research or spill over across diseases.', 'Varmus was supported by a group of representatives including appropriations subcommittee chair John Porter (R-Ill), who sought to preserve NIH autonomy in setting funding priorities (Dresser 1999;Epstein 2007).', 'They provided five unranked criteria: public health needs, scientific quality of the research, potential for scientific progress (the existence of promising pathways and qualified investigators), portfolio diversification along the broad and expanding frontiers of research, and adequate support of infrastructure (human capital, equipment instrumentation, and facilities).', 'These criteria provide some information about NIH priority-setting while maintaining significant scientific autonomy over funding decisions.', 'Although Congress stopped short of explicitly standardizing the NIH budget, the series of reports and hearings made it clear that advocates and members of Congress would continue to question whether NIH funding lined up with mortality and other measures of the burden of disease.', 'And as the NIH was increasingly critiqued on the basis of dollars per death, mortality gradually became a better predictor of NIH funding.', 'The coefficient for mortality is positive and significant, showing that during the time period under study, "big killers" had larger increases in NIH funding.', '30 As the mortality metric became increasingly taken for granted, high-mortality diseases were at an advantage in the competition for funds.', 'The positive interaction effect, showing that high-mortality diseases had a larger payoff from witness testimony, suggests that dollars-per-death claims helped witnesses secure funding increases for their diseases.', '32 Thus, the dollars-per-death frame was more than a mechanism for witnesses to secure direct benefits for their diseases; the introduction of the mortality metric systemically changed the terms of the debate over medical research funding.', 'Disease advocacy organizations encouraged Congress to think of patients with specific diseases as beneficiaries of medical research funding.', 'Throughout most of the twentieth century, when fights broke out over the distribution of NIH funding, diseases were not generally the competitors.', 'Midcentury congressional critiques of the NIH focused on whether money was being disbursed to unqualified researchers and whether NIH funding was "geographically elitist" (Guston 2000:74).', "Although the Institutes' overarching goal was always to improve the nation's health, this rhetoric constructed scientists as the beneficiaries of NIH funding.", 'Even though these disease advocacy organizations were not receiving money directly, they expressed an interest in the distribution of funding to diseases, and their presence as witnesses suggests that members of Congress viewed these claims as legitimate.', 'In their testimony, disease advocates portrayed patients as the beneficiaries of research funding.', 'For instance, in 1992, one breast cancer advocate argued that "my daughter Jody, the women in this room, and women everywhere deserve no less" than increased funding for breast cancer research.', 'These advocates depicted breast cancer patients, not scientists, as the beneficiaries of breast cancer research funding.', 'Discussions of the distribution of funding among states and researchers did not disappear, but they were now overshadowed by discussions of the distribution of funds to diseases.', 'This growing discursive link between the NIH and patients supports the claim that patients were increasingly thought of as beneficiaries of medical research funding.', 'Once patients were viewed as beneficiaries of NIH funding, moral judgments about their deservingness became increasingly relevant to funding deliberations.', 'When scientists and the public at large were viewed as the beneficiaries of medical research funding, it would have made little sense to argue that patients of any particular disease "deserved" more research funds.', 'But once patients were constructed as beneficiaries, some advocates began arguing that individuals suffering from their diseases were innocent victims, with the implication that other diseases merited less support.', 'In a letter to Representative Porter, a muscular dystrophy advocate attacked funding for research on drug abuse and alcoholism, saying that "it is shocking that over $754 million is devoted to address the health problems of people whose irresponsible behavior causes those problems, while less than 1 percent of that sum helps children dying of Duchenne muscular dystrophy" (Havemann 1998).', 'Additionally, witnesses for stigmatized diseases were more likely to justify funding on economic grounds.', 'Perhaps less confident that their stories would evoke sympathy, these witnesses were disproportionately likely to rely on economic arguments to justify funding increases.', 'Stigmatized diseases received less funding in the new political climate.', 'I document this pattern by tracking funding for lung cancer and liver cancer.', 'Year after year, both diseases received smaller funding increases than would have been predicted based on mortality.', 'The increasingly negative residuals for lung and liver cancer suggest that once patients were viewed as beneficiaries of medical research funding, stigmatized diseases were at a growing disadvantage.', 'By constructing patients as beneficiaries of medical research funding, disease advocates unintentionally increased the relevance of stigma to medical research priority-setting.', "Subsequent campaigns targeting other diseases were inspired by the AIDS movement's successes and adopted its symbols and strategies, including ribbons, fundraising walks, and federal advocacy (Anglin 1997;Dresser 2001;Klawiter 2008).", 'Disease advocacy transformed the politics of medical research funding.', 'In addition to securing direct benefits, disease advocacy organizations reshaped the funding distribution, introduced metrics for commensuration, changed the perceived beneficiaries of medical research, and made deservingness increasingly relevant to funding deliberations.', 'Regarding direct benefits, I found a strong relationship between advocacy and increases in NIH funding to diseases.', 'These results indicate that advocacy organizations can secure large benefits for their constituents.', 'Medical research funding can be given out in small units, meaning that Congress can distribute resources widely to placate as many groups as possible (Lowi 1964).', 'Finally, the large funding increases occurred in the context of an expanding NIH budget.', "Therefore, as more disease advocates secured direct benefits, the funding distribution shifted away from women's and blacks' diseases.", 'Advocates first asserted that diseases were the relevant categories across which to judge the NIH funding distribution.', 'In this case, advocates organized around disease categories and encouraged policymakers to judge the distribution of funds to diseases.', 'But advocacy organizations do not create categories in a vacuum, and the move to hold the NIH accountable for funding to diseases reveals an unexpected relationship between advocacy and established disease categories.', "They then created political pressure for the NIH to target research funding to these diseases, despite NIH officials' preference for funding research that might cross traditional disease boundaries.", "Thus, in challenging scientific authority over funding decisions, disease advocacy may actually have reinforced dominant disease classifications by diminishing scientists' ability to conduct research across categories.", 'When advocates used the dollars-per-death frame to demand funding increases for their diseases, they created political pressure to standardize the NIH budget by mortality and to formalize NIH priority-setting procedures.', "However, my findings support recent observations that standardization challenges experts' autonomy (Espeland and Stevens 1998;Evans 2002;Guston 2000;Porter 1995;Timmermans and Epstein 2010).", 'In this case, the NIH managed to avoid explicitly standardizing its priority-setting process, but the funding distribution gradually approached the standard proposed by many advocates.', 'Advocates also encouraged policymakers to think of patients as beneficiaries of medical research funding.', 'But when disease advocates asserted their interest in the distribution of medical research funding, they did more than awaken a predefined group of beneficiaries: they redefined who counted as a beneficiary, making a new set of interests relevant.', '38 Once patients were viewed as beneficiaries of medical research funding, disease stigma became increasingly relevant to NIH priority-setting.', 'In promoting mortality as a metric for commensuration and framing deserving patients as beneficiaries, advocates changed the rules of the competition for medical research funds (see Armstrong and Bernstein 2008).', 'These cultural changes had concrete effects on the funding distribution, shifting money toward high-mortality diseases and away from stigmatized diseases.', 'When disease advocates used the dollars-per-death frame to push for more funding for their diseases, the pressure to formalize NIH priority-setting and the increasing influence of mortality were side effects.', 'Similarly, when disease advocates defined patients as beneficiaries of medical research funding, they never intended to increase the relevance of stigma.', 'These findings suggest a more subtle role for social movement framing, which researchers view primarily as a strategy for achieving direct benefits (Amenta et al. 2010;Benford and Snow 2000;Burstein and Hirsh 2007;Cress and Snow 2000).', 'The NIH ultimately provided some information about priority-setting procedures and shifted more funding to high-mortality diseases.', '3. In one exception, Hegde and Sampat (2011) find that lobbying has positive effects on federal funding for rare diseases.', "6. One exception is Pedriana and Stryker's (1997) finding that supporters of affirmative action recast the meaning of equal employment opportunity.", 'Weir (1992) argues that during the 1960s, the media and politicians reframed the War on Poverty as primarily benefiting African Americans.', '10. Because DOD-CDMRP expenditures are much lower than NIH expenditures, I also ran all analyses with only NIH funding as the dependent variable.', 'Because most private foundations distribute funds to charities, including both types of nonprofits in my sample would risk double-counting their financial data (National Center for Charitable Statistics 2006).', "To test the robustness of the results, I ran the models in various ways: using the Prais-Winsten method instead of Cochrane-Orcutt; excluding DOD-CDMRP funding from the dependent variable; limiting the sample to fatal diseases; controlling for disability-adjusted life-years lost in addition to mortality; including HIV/AIDS and breast cancer in the analysis; and coding patients' race and gender as a percentage instead of as a dichotomous variable.", "When I include disease fixed effects, the race and gender coefficients are close to zero, indicating that within diseases, changes in patients' demographics do not affect research funding.", '30. This finding is separate from the pattern in which funding responds to changes in mortality, increasing as diseases become more prevalent.', '35. These funding deficits are substantial, given that the total 2005 funding levels for lung cancer and liver cancer were $180 million and $50 million, respectively.', 'Figure 4 .34References to Patients per 100 References to the NIH, Lung Cancer and Liver Cancer\'s Cumulative Residuals from Regressions of Funding Changes on Mortality and Advocacy, 1992 to 2006spokesman for the American Lung Association noted that "lung diseases cost the U.S. economy an estimated $84.4 billion annually" (U.S.', 'Table 1 .1Descriptive Statistics: Research Funding, Advocacy, and MortalityMean', 'Table 3 .3Cochrane-Orcutt Regression Analyses of Changes in Federal Research Funding to DiseasesNote: Dependent variable is change in NIH and DOD funding to disease research in millions.', "Research funds were provided by the Office of NIH History; the UC-Berkeley Science, Technology, and Society Center; and Berkeley Law's Empirical Legal Studies fellowship.", "Thanks also to the participants in UC-Berkeley's Inequality Workshop; Research Group on Multilevel Modeling; Center for Culture, Organizations, and Politics; and Empirical Legal Studies Workshop.", 'Michael Boyle of the NIH Office of Budget and David Cantor and Barbara Harkins of the Office of NIH History provided invaluable assistance with data collection.Funding', 'For example, the breast cancer organizations studied include Ribbon of Hope, which supports patients in Northeastern Wisconsin, and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, a large national organization that lobbies the government and funds research, education, and screening.', 'The lobbying variable directly measures financial attempts to influence government bodies, but not all lobbying is focused on research funding.', 'This heterogeneity likely biases my results downward, because not all of the measured activity is focused on lobbying for research funds.', 'Congressional testimony is a direct attempt to influence federal appropriations, and 80 to 90 percent of witnesses focus their testimony on research funding.']46,Bichler_ExpEco_2013_Vv25.pdf.tei

['Parties also use patronage for "raising campaign funds through the assessment of public employees. \'Two per cent clubs\' manage to squeeze large sums of money out of politically appointed employees to help defray campaign costs. The public pay roll is thus used in an indirect way to pay party expenses."', 'Maranto and Johnson (2007, 79) state the claim succinctly: "Before the 1950s, U.S. political appointments were primarily to help the incumbent party win elections as \'spoils\' patronage." 1 On the other hand, electoral considerations are not necessarily the primary factor affecting party leaders\' decisions regarding how to distribute patronage (e.g., Sorauf 1959;Wilson 1961;Johnston 1979 We thank Don Green, Ira Katznelson, Ken Shepsle, seminar participants at MIT and Stockholm School of Economics, participants of the Erasmus Political Economy Workshop, and panel participants at the Midwest Political Science Association Conference for helpful comments.', '1 In a similar but less critical vein, Key (1964) notes, "The patronage system may be considered, too, as a method of financing party activity. The operation of a party organization requires the services of many men and women... . Though much of this work is performed by unpaid volunteers, their efforts are not adequate. Indirectly, a considerable part of party expense is met by the public treasury, and the chief means of channeling public funds to party support is through the appointment of party workers to public office." tronage jobs may be used to maintain party organizations or be consumed as rents.', "2 Furthermore, if jobs are not allocated to maximize votes, patronage could even have a negative effect on a party's electoral support by alienating those who do not receive jobs."]139,Fombelle_JournAcaMarkSci_2012_vR3L.pdf.tei

greater lender interest results in greater reduction of the interest rate.', 'Borrowers with satisfactory objective characteristics are less likely to construct identity claims to receive funding; they feel their case stands firmly on its objective merits alone.', 'In this scenario, borrowers make identity claims that offset the attributions made by lenders about the borrower being fundamentally not a creditworthy person.', 'Research on perceived risk supports this reasoning; decision makers gather information as a risk-reduction strategy and tend to be risk averse in the absence of sufficient information about the decision (e.g., Cox and Rich 1964).', 'To the extent that the identity claims presented in a narrative reduce uncertainty about a borrower, lenders should be more likely to view the listing favorably, increase loan funding, and decrease the final interest rate.', 'We have offered some preliminary theory in support of these specific relationships between identity content and loan funding/interest rate reductions, but this examination remains exploratory, so we pose these relationships as exploratory research questions (ERQ): ERQ 1 : Which types of identity claims influence lending decisions, as indicated by', '(a) an increase in loan funding and', 'A significant percentage of borrowers on Prosper have very poor credit histories, and most loan requests do not receive funding.', 'To avoid overweighting high-risk borrowers and unfunded loans, we sampled an equal number of loan requests from each credit grade.', 'To do so, we first separated funded loan requests from unfunded ones, then divided each group by the seven credit grades assigned by Prosper.', 'Second, the vast majority of listings lacking a narrative do not receive funding.', 'We randomly sampled posts from the 14 subgroups (2 funding status × 7 credit grades).', "Each listing includes the borrower's credit grade, requested loan amount, maximum interest rate, loan funding, final interest rate of funded loans, payback status of funded loans after two years, and open-ended text data.", 'Before combining the data from 2006 and 2007, we tested for a year effect but found none, which supports their combination.', 'The first dependent variable, loan funding, ranges from 0% to 905% in our data set, but requiring an equal inclusion of all credit ratings skews these statistics.', 'The mean percentage funded (including all listings) is 105.74% (SD = 129 2) and that for funded listings is 205.45% (SD = 119 6).', 'Because it was skewed, we log-transformed loan funding as follows: Ln(percent funded +1).', 'The mean percentage reduction in interest rate for all listings is 6.4% (SD = 10 7) and for funded listings is 11.88% (SD = 12 75).', 'The third dependent variable is loan performance, measured two years after loan funding.', 'For each funded loan in our data set, we obtained data about whether the loan was paid ahead of schedule and in full (31.1% of funded listings), was current and paid as scheduled (40.5%), involved payments between one and four months late (7.1%), or had defaulted (21.3%).', 'Prior research shows that borrowers on Prosper with better credit grades, those that request smaller loan amounts, and those that offer higher initial interest rates are substantially more likely to receive funding (Ryan, Reuk, and Wang 2007).', 'In H 2a , we posited that more identities claimed in a narrative would have a positive effect on loan funding.', 'To test this hypothesis, we regressed the number of identities as the main predictor and credit grade, requested amount, gender, marital status, race, and family status as covariates on the natural log of loan funding.', "We present the results in Table 3, which shows that when we control for borrowers' demographics and loan characteristics, the number of identities borrowers claim in their narratives positively affected loan funding ( = 11, SE = 04, t = 2 81, p < 001).", 'Furthermore, in support of H 2a , the relation between the number of identities and loan', 'funding was monotonic and increasing (significant linear trend t 1 472 = 2 71, p < 01;

["F irms often thank their loyal customers by offering acknowledgments that include small financial benefits (Lyon 2012;O'Malley 1998;skh 2013).", 'Firms presumably provide these financial benefits believing that they will make customers feel appreciated, a fundamental component of relational satisfaction (Reis et al. 2000) that is linked to long-term commitment in marketing channel relationships (Geyskens, Steenkamp, and Kumar 1999;Hoffman and Lowitt 2008).', 'Importantly, none of this previous research has occurred in the marketing context of acknowledging consumers for efforts they have already voluntarily expended.', "Moreover, we do not alter whether the firm's acknowledgments are public or private; all acknowledgments are private in our research.", '2 Our focus on firm acknowledgments for voluntarily expended effort is valuable because communicating appreciation is a critical part of customer relationship management in many marketing contexts.', 'To the extent that gratitude is appropriately expressed, consumers are likely to be willing to engage in a deeper relationship with the firm (Algoe, Fredrickson, and Gable 2013).', 'First, consider how consumers may evaluate an acknowledgment of effort or loyalty that involves only verbal gratitude, thus offering zero financial benefit.', 'In our context, verbal acknowledgments may be considered single-component acknowledgments.', 'When consumers receive a verbal acknowledgment, their responses are likely to be based primarily on whether the acknowledgment adequately meets norms associated with appropriately expressing verbal gratitude, which are fairly well-defined in Western culture (Hilton 1995).', 'For example, consumers may evaluate whether the acknowledgment conforms to prototypical gratitude expressions by accurately honoring their contribution and expressing sincere gratitude (Lambert, Graham, and Fincham 2009).', 'Importantly, the norms of expressing verbal gratitude do not require that the expresser provide some form of financial benefit.', 'Indeed, research shows that simple expressions of gratitude have strong positive effects on people (Grant and Gino 2010).', 'Thus, consumers will evaluate verbal acknowledgments according to adherence to verbal norms alone.', 'For example, consider a consumer who receives only a verbal acknowledgment that effectively communicates gratitude.', 'Next, consider that the firm decides to add a small financial benefit to this message.', 'Although this financial benefit objectively makes the consumer better off than she was before (i.e., it is objectively closer to her quantitative expectations than is the zero amount received in the prior case), she will evaluate it negatively if it does not match the amount she would expect for her time or effort.', "The average of the positive evaluation verbal component and the negative evaluation of the financial component will be lower than the consumer's positive evaluation of the verbal acknowledgment alone.", "This difference in evaluation is the trivialization effect-the extent to which adding a financial benefit to a verbal acknowledgment reduces consumers' felt appreciation.", 'The term "trivializing compensation" refers to such smaller-than-expected monetary benefit amounts.', 'Formally, assuming that the message content adheres to verbal norms and thus is evaluated positively, H 1 : Consumers feel more appreciated by a firm when they receive a verbal acknowledgment rather than a similarly worded financial acknowledgment with trivializing compensation.', "Both H 1 and H 2a-b draw on the theory that consumers' evaluations of a financial acknowledgment are based on both adherence to verbal norms and meeting financial benefit expectations.", 'This theory suggests that if marketers can strategically alter the financial benefit reference point that consumers use, they can encourage more positive evaluations of small monetary benefits and therefore mitigate the trivialization effect.', "First, firms should be able to mitigate trivialization effects if they can anchor consumers' financial reference points at values lower than the received financial benefit.", 'To do so, the firm may make the possibility of lower benefits salient to consumers.', 'In such cases, consumers will be encouraged to adopt a comparative or "joint evaluation" mode (Hsee 1996;Hsee et al. 1999;Tanner 2008), evaluating the financial benefit offered by the firm relative to the possibility of lower outcomes rather than considering it in isolation, relative to their own (likely higher) expectations.', 'Practically, the possibility of lower benefits can be made salient by couching a small monetary reward in terms of a range of possible rewards (e.g., "To thank you for your loyalty, the underlined discount is the amount you will receive: 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, or 5% off a future purchase," wherein a 5% discount might otherwise have been perceived as failing to meet expectations).', '3 Second, our theory suggests that the trivialization effect may be mitigated if the monetary benefit is offered in a form that is not naturally evaluated according to a higher financial benefit reference point.', "Specifically, we suggest that firms can offer the small benefit in a prosocial form, in which the benefit is directed at a worthy charity on the consumer's behalf.", 'Across all studies, we focus on the effects of financial (vs. verbal) acknowledgments on felt appreciation and satisfaction in the context of acknowledging customers for firm-beneficial behavior.', 'In all studies, we control for the message content across the verbal and financial acknowledgments being compared to help isolate the impact of making an acknowledgment financial as opposed to verbal.', 'Studies 2a and 2b provide support for our proposed theory underlying the trivialization effect by demonstrating the impact of varying adherence to different types of standards (verbal gratitude norms and financial benefit expectations) on the trivialization effect.', 'In all three studies, we designed the verbal acknowledgments to conform to gratitude expression norms and selected the financial benefit amounts to be lower than financial benefit expectations.', 'Participants received either a verbal acknowledgment or a financial acknowledgment (with a small financial benefit of $.05).', 'Participants then saw a note that either thanked them (verbal acknowledgment condition) or thanked them and gave them $.05 (financial acknowledgment condition).', '4 In separate pretests, we confirmed that the verbal acknowledgments used in Studies 1a, 1b, 2b, 3, and 4 adhered to verbal gratitude expression norms.', 'They then viewed the acknowledgment note used in the studies and rated the note on two seven-point items measuring adherence to verbal gratitude expression norms (the same items were used in Study 2a to measure adherence to verbal norms).', 'These two items were significantly correlated (r = .45, p < .001); thus, we averaged them to form an adherence to verbal gratitude expression norms index.', "We also confirmed that the verbal acknowledgments used in Study 1c and in Study 2a's adherent to verbal norms condition adhered to verbal gratitude expression norms by asking participants in the main study to rate the note on these two seven-point items after they had already answered the dependent variable questions.", 'With regard to the financial benefit amount selected in Studies 1a and 1c, we selected $.05 as an amount that we thought would not meet expectations for the majority of participants for Studies 1a and 1c, which were conducted in person with actual hotel conference center and dining establishment customers.', 'With regard to the financial benefit amount selected in Studies 1b, 2a, and 4, we selected $.01 as an amount that we thought would not meet expectations for the majority of participants because MTurk participants are used to receiving relatively small financial compensation (often mere cents).', "At the end of Study 1b, we asked participants in the verbal acknowledgment condition how much of a bonus they would expect to receive from Pure Coffee & Tea to thank them for providing feedback on their competitors' websites.", 'Finally, with regard to the financial benefit amount selected in Studies 2b and 3, we conducted a pretest to establish participants\' financial benefit expectations (the pretest is described in the Study 2b "Methods" subsection).', 'Studies 2a and 2b examine the importance of two types of standards (verbal gratitude norms and financial benefit expectations) in leading to the trivialization effect (H 2 ).', 'Collectively, these two studies test our theory that people evaluate verbal acknowledgments relative to verbal norms, whereas they evaluate acknowledgments with financial benefits relative to both verbal norms and financial benefit expectations.', "Note that although there are many ways that a firm's message could be nonadherent to verbal norms, we varied one important aspect of verbal norms-the extent to which the acknowledgment was offered out of a sense of obligation-because prior research has indicated that an acknowledgment does not adhere to prototypical gratitude expressions if it is offered out of a sense of obligation (Lambert, Graham, and Fincham 2009).", 'Manipulation check (financial acknowledgment with $.01 bonus conditions).', 'In the two financial acknowledgment conditions, participants were asked, "Does the MTurk bonus provided by the [Business School\'s] management team fail to meet, meet, or exceed your expectations for how much of an MTurk bonus the university would provide?" (1 = "fails to meet my expectations," 4 = "meets my expectations," and 7 = "exceeds my expectations").', 'MTurk bonus met (or, in this case, failed to meet) financial benefit expectations similarly, regardless of whether the message content adhered to prototypical gratitude expressions.', 'Manipulation check (verbal acknowledgment conditions).', 'In the two verbal acknowledgment conditions, participants were asked two questions to gauge the extent to which they thought that the message content adhered to verbal norms.', 'We developed these two questions (see Web Appendix W3) based on the prototypical gratitude expressions described in Lambert, Graham, and Fincham (2009).', "We selected these discount amounts on the basis of a separate pretest in which 46 participants from MTurk saw the same scenario as participants in the main study's acknowledgment with 0% discount condition.", 'In this separate pretest, participants were asked what percentage discount off their next purchase they would expect to receive to thank them for their loyalty.', "Therefore, by manipulating the financial benefit at these amounts, we are able to increase the degree to which the financial benefit meets or exceeds participants' expectations.", 'Participants then saw an e-mail that was manipulated in line with the randomly assigned conditions to either thank the customer (verbal acknowledgment) or thank the customer and offer a discount on her next purchase (the size of the discount varied from 5% to 40%, depending on the financial acknowledgment condition).', "Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect occurs because offering a financial acknowledgment leads consumers to evaluate the firm's response in part according to a different standard-whether it meets their financial benefit expectations-rather than solely according to whether the message content meets verbal norms associated with prototypical gratitude expressions (Studies 2a and 2b).", 'Accordingly, when the content of a message adheres to norms of verbal gratitude expressions (Lambert, Graham, and Fincham 2009), including a smaller-than-expected financial benefit backfires.', 'However, when the content of the message violates norms of verbal gratitude expressions (Study 2a) or when financial benefits meet or exceed expectations (Study 2b), the trivialization effect dissipates.', 'Given our findings, what guidance can we offer to a manager aiming to acknowledge customers effectively?', 'First, it is important that managers do not underestimate the value of a simple verbal acknowledgment that adheres to verbal norms (Lambert, Graham, and Fincham 2009).', 'As our studies show, a verbal acknowledgment can be better than a similarly worded financial acknowledgment so long as the message content meets verbal gratitude expression norms and the financial benefit is smaller than expected.', "Second, managers should conduct market research to understand people's expectations of appropriate financial benefit levels.", 'Study 2b shows that, ideally, amounts that exceed the expected financial benefit should be used so that managers can reverse the trivialization effect.', "Indeed, Study 2b's findings do not support an alternative account that people simply react more negatively to financial acknowledgments than to verbal acknowledgments.", "Rather, offering a financial acknowledgment can be a beneficial way to acknowledge loyal customers for their support, provided customers' financial benefit expectations are met.", 'Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you very much for your time and support in providing this feedback for our company.', 'We [verbal acknowledgment condition: "wanted to send you this note";

['Acknowledgements,This research was conducted as part of the project Food Intake Insights in Urban China (SMP17002), a Seed Money Project funded by Topsector Agri & Food.', 'In their experiment, Chatelain et al. (2018) used a fictitious advertisement where positive message framing ("Thanks to you, more than 90% of all plastic bottles are recycled in Germany, more than in any other country. Thank you very much") was combined with positive images (including images of a butterfly on someone\'s hand).', 'A similar experimental design can be used to test different messages to reduce meat consumption, in which one message is aimed at eliciting prospective "warm-glow" feelings (using similar types of framing and images as Chatelain et al., 2018and/or Schneider et al., 2017, while a different message is purely aimed at informing consumers of health and/or sustainability benefits of eating less meat.', 'The first type of message could read "Just imagine how good you could feel about yourself when you reduce your meat consumption. Because of people like you, CO 2 -emissions can be reduced by up to 50% by 2050. Thank you very much!" and use similar images as Chatelain et al. (2018) and images of nature (White et al., 2010).', 'For instance, it could be reasoned that the different types of benefits of eating less meat affect each other: consumers could derive stronger prospective "warm-glow" feelings when more sustainability and/or health benefits are perceived.', 'Given that the perceived importance of making sustainable food choices moderated the extent to which prospective "warm-glow" feelings affect the intention to reduce meat consumption via curtailment, this suggests that at least perceived sustainability benefits might affect how good consumers anticipate to feel by eating less meat.']488,Tavits_AmJourPoliSci_2015_BxRk.pdf.tei
