<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Employees' recovery from the effects of occupational stress can be affected by their actions during time away from work. Conservation of resources theory argues that a key to an effective stress recovery process is the replenishment of resources during off-work time (a weekend in the present study). We test a model of the stress recovery process during a weekend whereby two recovery mechanisms (weekend activities and recovery experiences) improve two personal resources (self-regulatory capacity and state optimism), subsequently affecting psychological outcomes (work engagement and burnout) at the start of the next workweek. Employees (n = 233) from various jobs responded to online surveys before and after a weekend. Controlling for pre-weekend resource levels and psychological outcomes assessed on Friday, the two weekend stress recovery mechanisms (weekend activities and recovery experiences) contributed to improving or maintaining self-regulatory and optimism resources on Monday. Of note, psychological detachment may result in less rather than more of the resource of state optimism on Monday. Monday resource levels were linked to improved work engagement and burnout. As proposed by conservation of resources theory, employees can benefit from participating in activities that replenish resources necessary to meet work demands upon returning to work after a weekend.

As applied to the recovery process, resource theories of occupational stress argue that stressful work experiences reduce an employee's resources, and stress recovery entails replenishing them (e.g., conservation of resources theory and the effort-recovery model (ERM); <ref type="bibr" coords="1,95.87,450.78,76.51,8.80" target="#b24">Hobfoll, 1989, and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,175.52,450.78,46.59,8.80" target="#b37">Meijman &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,225.25,450.78,109.99,8.80">Mulder, 1998, respectively)</ref>.

Two mechanisms of the recovery process include the more objective recovery activities or behaviors that people do and the more subjective recovery experiences that people feel; the assumption is that doing activities results in employees feeling the experiences. There is a growing body of research supporting the beneficial outcomes associated with these two recovery mechanisms (see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,278.75,546.82,140.32,8.80" target="#b69">Sonnentag, Niessen, &amp; Neff, 2012</ref> for review), but research is lacking that links these recovery mechanisms to the actual resources that they are theorized to replenish. Directly testing recovery theories by measuring actual resources over time will help determine which resources are actually replenished (or not) by the recovery process and if this process affects all resources the same way.</p><p>Research on evening and weekend recovery has demonstrated outcomes such as positive mood <ref type="bibr" coords="3,450.77,77.40,71.22,8.80;3,62.02,89.36,112.28,8.80" target="#b15">(Fritz, Sonnentag, Spector, &amp; McInroe, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,178.47,89.36,162.66,8.80" target="#b63">Sonnentag, Binnewies, &amp; Mojza, 2008)</ref>, work engagement <ref type="bibr" coords="3,426.34,89.36,95.63,8.80;3,62.02,101.38,66.35,8.80" target="#b31">(Kühnel, Sonnentag, &amp; Westman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,132.10,101.38,141.28,8.80">ten Brummelhuis &amp; Bakker, 2012)</ref>, reduced burnout <ref type="bibr" coords="3,351.22,101.38,106.59,8.80" target="#b13">(Fritz &amp; Sonnentag, 2005)</ref>, and improved performance upon returning to work after the weekend . Notably, however, none of these studies examined the role of employee's replenishment of their resources (the improvement or increase in specific resources), the primary component of resource recovery theories. Instead, the outcome variables such as strain are usually shown to improve; whether the replenishment of resources is the process through which this happens is not investigated, and therefore, resource recovery theories are not tested directly. To test the assumptions of recovery theories that resources and eventual outcomes change because of weekend recovery, we test changes in resources and other outcomes on Monday by controlling for baseline levels of these variables on Friday.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal resources relevant to recovery</head><p>The focus of previous research on indirect indicators of resource replenishment rather than directly testing actual resource replenishment may be due, in part, to the difficulty identifying which resources are actually recoverable. COR theory outlines various categories of resources that may be valued by people (objects, conditions, personal characteristics, and energies). The present study focused on personal (characteristic) resources, which are valued aspects of the self, linked to resilience, that foster peoples' ability to control the environment and obtain goals <ref type="bibr" coords="3,62.02,305.36,251.52,8.80" target="#b21">(Halbesleben, Neveu, Paustian-Underdahl, &amp; Westman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,316.92,305.36,58.17,8.80" target="#b24">Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. Based on this definition, however, just about anything could qualify as a resource; we suggest that not all resources are necessarily recoverable. In line with applications of COR theory to the recovery process and findings from recovery research, we argue that there are three properties of personal resources that determine their relevance for recovery. First, because the recovery process is dynamic, resources must be amenable to change, or they could not be "recovered." That is, any resources studied based on COR theory must be variable over time so that they can be lost (or reduced) and regained (increased). Second, resources need to be affected by mechanisms of the recovery process. That is, replenishment or gain in a resource could be affected by engaging in specific off-work activities or the recovery experiences resulting from those activities. Third, increases in resources should result in improvements in indicators of well-being (i.e., reduced strains) and effective functioning at work.</p><p>The present study focused on two personal resources: self-regulatory capacity and state optimism. These resources are cognitive, emotional, and motivational constructs because they can affect or help regulate employees' emotional states, cognitions and beliefs, and facilitate goal attainment at work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,402.07,449.36,119.87,8.80;3,62.02,461.38,22.70,8.80" target="#b29">Kluemper, Little, &amp; DeGroot, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,87.87,461.38,118.15,8.80" target="#b76">Twenge &amp; Baumeister, 2002)</ref>. These resources are relevant to the recovery process because they both have the three resource properties outlined earlier: these resources are amenable to change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,436.14,473.40,85.83,8.80;3,62.02,485.36,45.32,8.80" target="#b3">Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Tice, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,109.98,485.36,219.44,8.80" target="#b80">Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, &amp; Schaufeli, 2007)</ref> and are associated with indicators of well-being <ref type="bibr" coords="3,62.02,497.38,92.89,8.80" target="#b29">(Kluemper et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,157.61,497.38,135.13,8.80" target="#b42">Nix, Ryan, Manly, &amp; Deci, 1999)</ref> and functioning at work (e.g., job performance, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.51,497.38,34.46,8.80;3,62.02,509.40,100.50,8.80" target="#b34">Luthans, Youseff, &amp; Avolio, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,164.87,509.40,98.44,8.80" target="#b44">Porath &amp; Bateman, 2006)</ref>. Employees should be motivated to engage in protective recovery behaviors during a weekend to replenish these resources that are needed for work on Monday. Other resources that could be relevant to recovery, like the state versions of self-efficacy and self-esteem, have been shown to fluctuate over time and are valuable for functioning at work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,264.81,545.40,210.01,8.80" target="#b81">Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, &amp; Schaufeli, 2009</ref>); however, they were not included in the present study because of their potential overlap with self-regulatory capacity.</p><p>The first resource in the present study, self-regulatory capacity, is employees' allocation of their cognitive and affective energy resources across tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,220.26,581.40,136.52,8.80" target="#b28">(Kanfer, Chen, &amp; Pritchard, 2008)</ref>.

Vigor is a facet of engagement, which is usually examined as an indicator of being recovered rather than a resource that leads to recovery. The present study uses a direct measure of this resource, the perceived self-regulatory capacity-an employee's perception that he/she can persist on a given task.</p><p>State optimism, the other personal resource in the present study, refers to positive judgments about future events and the belief that favorable outcomes result from a combination of one's own behavior and fate, which helps people work toward their future goals <ref type="bibr" coords="4,168.72,161.36,100.66,8.80" target="#b53">(Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,272.08,161.36,64.01,8.80" target="#b56">Seligman, 1991)</ref>.

Replenishing state optimism will affect how employees explain causes of work-related events and how they regulate their actions, which has implications for job attitudes (job satisfaction and commitment), well-being (psychological strain and burnout; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,437.91,209.38,67.01,8.80;4,44.96,221.40,21.43,8.80" target="#b29">Kluemper et al., 2009)</ref>, and motivation (work engagement; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,217.37,221.40,103.21,8.80" target="#b81">Xanthopoulou et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,328.14,221.40,17.15,8.80" target="#b82">Xanthopoulou et al., , 2011</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The two recovery mechanisms</head><p>Recovery mechanisms include off-work activities and subjective experiences that are theorized to facilitate the replenishment of resources. The activities are more behavioral, because they represent what the person does; the experiences are more psychological, because they represent how the person feels. Research has demonstrated the beneficial effects of having recovery experiences during off-work time. It is assumed that recovery is determined by the degree to which an employee's recovery activities result in recovery experiences (proposed in a model by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,44.96,345.90,113.18,8.80" target="#b83">Xanthopoulou et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords=""></ref> and previously demonstrated with students in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,359.10,345.90,145.82,8.80;4,44.96,357.86,21.43,8.80" target="#b45">Ragsdale, Beehr, Grebner, &amp; Han, 2011)</ref>. Their joint effects on resource recovery are not well-understood, however. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by examining recovery experiences as outcomes of off-work activities that explain resource replenishment and improved well-being ( <ref type="figure" coords="4,211.93,381.90,31.52,8.80">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>

For example, three studies examined how off-work activities during workday evenings predict two recovery experiences. Two of these studies used the activities in the present study as control variables, but they generally did not predict evening psychological detachment and mastery experiences <ref type="bibr" coords="5,150.05,317.38,121.85,8.80" target="#b38">(Mojza, Lorenz, et al., 2010;</ref>. Another study found that social, low effort, and physical activities predicted more psychological detachment and relaxation experiences, whereas work and household activities predicted less psychological detachment and relaxation experiences <ref type="bibr" coords="5,62.02,353.38,145.69,8.80">(ten Brummelhuis &amp; Bakker, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>These mixed findings may be attributed to different study designs (different time lags and measurements used), sample characteristics (occupation and family status), and relevant to the present study, they only looked at short recovery periods of an evening between work days. The one-evening time period allows fewer activities and experiences to occur than a two-day time period, and this may make the results less consistent. For example, if it is the employees' evening for his or her bowling league (or softball, or volunteering at the food pantry), that is probably all he or she would be doing on that evening. If the next night is the employees' night to watch his or her favorite TV shows, to attend a night class, or to take his or her kids to and from their activities, there is probably not much else that will get done that evening. Thus, the activities on one weekday evening are limited and may be different from what happens on another weekday evening, leading to inconsistency. On a weekend by contrast, with a Friday evening and two full days available, it is possible to engage in many different activities. In addition, some recovery activities may need to be given more time or more attention in order for them to help than other activities require, and thus, their effectiveness is not as good on a single evening than some other activities. On a weekend, there is likely to be more time to give to each activity.</p></div>

As <ref type="figure" coords="5,440.28,617.40,35.90,8.80">Figure 1</ref> illustrates, recovery experiences are closer to the replenishment of personal resources in the causal chain, and if the employees' weekend activities can lead to positive experiences, they will help replenish resources. The experiences should facilitate improvement in resources because they offer protection by stopping resource drain or providing opportunities for resource replenishment as described by COR theory <ref type="bibr" coords="6,276.95,89.36,104.58,8.80" target="#b21">(Halbesleben et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,385.57,89.36,59.69,8.80" target="#b24">Hobfoll, 1989)</ref> and the ERM <ref type="bibr" coords="6,44.96,101.38,106.20,8.80" target="#b37">(Meijman &amp; Mulder, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The recovery experiences of psychological detachment and relaxation should facilitate the replenishment of resources because they terminate the mental and physical stress response, and thus stop the need to mobilize resources in response to work demands. That is, relaxation and psychological detachment experiences remove demands placed on resources by switching off mental representations of work during nonwork time (detachment) and helping the body to physically unwind and calm activated systems (relaxation), which gives resources the "break" they need to be restored. Although mastery experiences may require engaging in some effortful activities, the challenges associated with them provide opportunities for employees to build competence and proficiency, which are mechanisms for generating or replenishing resources. Having control experiences suggest that employees can choose to do something favorable for recovery, or they can choose to stop doing something that interferes with recovery. Therefore, employees are giving their resources an opportunity to be replenished by actively pursuing resource-building challenges (mastery) or engaging in preferred, recovery-inducing behaviors (control).</p><p>We expect the experiences that follow weekend activities will affect resource levels at work on Monday through a positive spillover process <ref type="bibr" coords="6,148.03,257.40,141.85,8.80" target="#b22">(Hanson, Hammer, &amp; Colton, 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p>Five hundred participants were recruited by communicating with them directly through the Study Response Project, an online participant pool that facilitates academic research, and undergraduate students contacting working individuals in return for extra credit. To be included in the study, participants had to work a traditional workweek, Monday through Friday.</p><p>Participants responded to three surveys within one week's time. Surveys were opened and closed at certain times on their respective days so participants could not access surveys beyond the required times. They first received a demographics questionnaire on Wednesday (at 9:00 AM EST) to ensure eligibility. The next survey was administered at the end of the workweek, Friday (at 2:00 PM EST), to assess personal resources and psychological outcomes that were used as baseline controls for these variables after the weekend. The last survey was administered following the weekend, on Monday (at 9:00 AM EST), and asked about the weekend and again assessed personal resources and psychological outcomes. All surveys were closed by 3:00 AM EST to account for anyone taking surveys in other time zones. For paper and pencil surveys, we asked participants to record the time and date that they responded to their surveys. Weekend activities and recovery experiences were assessed, retrospectively, after the weekend to capture the accumulation of the behaviors and experiences.</p><p>After demographic measures were obtained on Wednesday, participants received either an email on Friday and Monday with a link to the online questionnaires for that day or a paper-and-pencil survey packet to be returned via mail. Participants were instructed on what days to complete each survey (demographics on Wednesday, the next questionnaire on Friday, and the final one on the following Monday) and were sent reminder emails on the day each survey should be completed. Surveys were matched using codes chosen by the participants. There were no mean differences in study variables associated with the form of data collection (study response, undergraduate recruitment-online, and undergraduate recruitment paper-and-pencil).</p><p>Participants were either not invited to subsequent surveys or were removed from the analysis for careless responding if they met any of the following criteria: (i) incorrect responses to bogus items embedded within the surveys (e.g., "I want you to select 'Disagree'"), (ii) or completing the Friday or Monday survey in less than 4 min, or (iii) reporting an excess of 75 h spent across all weekend activities (2 SD above the sample mean for total weekend activity hours [M = 35.53 hours]). Although a weekend (roughly defined as Friday 5 PM to Monday 4 AM) includes approximately 58 h, the activities measured in the present study may not be mutually exclusive. That is, people may engage in activities in multiple categories simultaneously (e.g., watching T.V. while exercising, shopping with friends), but participants reported time spent for those activities separately. Therefore, their total time spent on activities may exceed the maximum number of hours in a weekend.

Mastery had direct-only, non-mediation effects on burnout and work engagement. Relaxation had no effect on burnout or work engagement. Hypothesis 2 was partially supported. Finally, Hypothesis 3 stated that both weekend recovery experiences and Monday personal resources would mediate the relationships between weekend activities and psychological outcomes on Monday. To test this hypothesis, an alternative model was tested with direct paths added from each weekend activity to each psychological outcome on Monday (10 new paths). Overall, the fit of this partially mediated model was adequate (χ 2 [84, N = 233] = 157.21, p &lt; .001, χ 2 /df = 1.87, RMSEA = .06, CFI = .92) but not significantly better than the fully mediated model (Δχ 2 [10] = 10.24, p = .42).

Indirect-only mediation was found for the relationship of social activities and household/childcare activities with work engagement.

Because none of the alternative models resulted in significantly better fit, we conclude that there is good evidence that both recovery experiences and resource replenishment mediate the relationships between potential recovery activities of employees on the weekend and outcomes on the following Monday. For some activities (e.g., social and work-related), however, the specific recovery experiences matter, as only a couple of them accounted for these effects. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>It has been understood for a long time that, although recovery from strain due to work stressors can be achieved through respites like vacations, the recovery is usually short-lived (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,357.79,317.38,100.01,8.80" target="#b77">Westman &amp; Eden, 1997)</ref>. Recovery that occurs more frequently (e.g., every weekend) might be more beneficial than recovery that occurs once per year (e.g., an annual vacation) however, simply because the person experiences the recovery more often. The present study focused on the recovery process that occurs during a weekend. Consistent with the proposed model, spending time on weekend activities eventually results in reduced burnout and increased work engagement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,491.87,365.40,30.10,8.80;13,62.02,377.36,69.70,8.80" target="#b13">Fritz &amp; Sonnentag, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,134.19,377.36,73.90,8.80" target="#b31">Kühnel et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,215.10,377.36,17.28,8.80" target="#b30">Kühnel et al., , 2012</ref>; this recovery process occurs through the mediating effects of recovery experiences and resource replenishment, as proposed by COR theory. A previous study demonstrated recovery experiences mediate this relationship between activities and strain outcomes during a weekend, but that was for college students doing their academic work <ref type="bibr" coords="13,242.08,413.36,90.43,8.80" target="#b45">(Ragsdale et al., 2011)</ref>. The present study extended this research not only by studying a sample of actual employees, but also by more directly testing actual resource replenishment specified by COR theory.</p><p>The proposed process of resource replenishment developed in line with recovery theories was broadly supported by the comparisons of model fit. That is, weekend activities seem to predict various recovery experiences, which  affect changes in resource levels and eventually psychological outcomes upon returning to work on Monday. However, the results of the specific tests of indirect effects were varied and have implications for future research.</p><p>Because this is the first study to test a model of employees' recovery and resource replenishment, the present findings will be useful for guiding future model building. First, findings of indirect-only mediation were consistent with the theoretical framework and proposed model, and such relationships should be modeled again. For example, both resources mediated the relationships between psychological detachment with burnout and work engagement. Second, direct-only non-mediation or complementary and competitive mediation results suggest that omitted mediators should be considered (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,200.70,353.38,71.66,8.80" target="#b84">Zhao et al., 2010)</ref>. For example, resources were complementary mediators of the relationship between control and burnout, meaning that control had both a negative direct and indirect effect on burnout. The direct effect suggests that some other resource was potentially not accounted for in the proposed model. By following the significant pathways through the model, we can differentiate which variables are likely to be important for recovery (especially for self-regulatory capacity and state optimism) and where there is opportunity for future research to explore omitted variables. Because detachment and control were the only recovery experiences with significant unique paths both from the weekend activities to them and from them to the replenishment of resources on Monday, they are the most likely experiences responsible for the mediation findings. If relaxation and mastery experiences are effective as mechanisms for replenishing resources, their specific effects were either masked by examining recovery experiences together as mediators (e.g., the indirect effect of low effort activities on self-regulatory capacity), or it may be for some resources other than the two measured in the present study (state optimism and self-regulatory capacity). This possibility awaits future research. Experiencing control during the weekend worked exactly as prior research and theory would expect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,99.81,509.40,140.83,8.80" target="#b48">Ryan, Bernstein, &amp; Brown, 2010)</ref>. Subjective control experiences may be positively affected by the resource-providing social activities and negatively affected by the resource-consuming work-related activities, and control positively predicts Monday's replenishment of both resources in the study, self-regulatory capacity, and state optimism.</p><p>Work-related activities and household/childcare activities are sometimes assumed to have deleterious effects to the recovery process <ref type="bibr" coords="14,129.66,569.38,71.95,8.80" target="#b60">(Sonnentag, 2001)</ref>. Following the signs on the paths, however, work-related activities prevent psychological detachment, but less detachment during the weekend is actually beneficial, because it predicts better state optimism on Monday. We interpret this as meaning that the employees who engage in work-related activities during the weekend are more optimistic on Monday because they have accomplished enough to be ready for work on Monday. In other words, if some employees do not work on the weekends, they will be overwhelmed by even more work waiting for them on Monday; that would make it hard to be optimistic about getting everything done in the coming workweek. The effects of household/childcare activities on resources are less clear because they show a positive direct effect and a negative indirect effect (competitive mediation) on self-regulatory capacity. Household/childcare activities during the weekend have a weaker and positive relationship with detachment, suggesting engaging in household and childcare duties is a way to disengage; but it may actually be detrimental because of detachment's negative prediction of Monday's optimism. Therefore, psychological detachment experience's effect may actually be harmful. The harm comes because of detachment's negative relationship with the resource of state optimism, which mediates its relationship with both outcomes in a direction suggesting that detachment leads to less optimism and therefore greater burnout and less engagement. These findings are further supported by the psychological detachment's positive indirect effect on burnout and negative indirect effect on work engagement. Many employees may be better off if they experience less rather than more psychological detachment during weekends. We speculate that this effect applies especially to those employees who really do need to work during the weekend in order to avoid falling behind in their work. If we could identify those workers with a moderator variable, the negative relationship of detachment with optimism might be even stronger for them.</p><p>At the same time, however, the negative relationship of control with optimism and self-regulatory capacity may cancel out the beneficial effects of not detaching from work during the weekend. People perceive they have less control over the weekend as they spend more time on work-related activities, and a lack of perceived control over the weekend will interfere with replenishing both self-regulatory capacity and state optimism. This is especially important because changes in self-regulatory resources have a stronger impact on burnout and work engagement than changes in state optimism do. Further, the indirect effects of control on burnout and work engagement are slightly stronger than the indirect effects of detachment on the same outcomes. Even though employees may return to work feeling more optimistic, that may not offset the costs of limited self-regulatory capacity. Thus, recovery experiences may have both strong favorable mediated effects and also weaker unfavorable mediated effects on outcomes, through resources as mediators, showing the complexity of the resource replenishment process that is a main tenet of COR theory.</p><p>Thus, our findings on psychological detachment are inconsistent with previous literature that suggests detachment is generally important for recovery (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,246.60,377.36,117.13,8.80" target="#b62">Sonnentag &amp; Bayer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,369.36,377.36,114.67,8.80" target="#b67">Sonnentag &amp; Kruel, 2006)</ref>. Recent research seems to present psychological detachment as being particularly important, because it continues to receive the most research attention independent of other recovery experiences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,440.64,401.40,81.29,8.80;15,62.02,413.36,106.96,8.80" target="#b16">Fritz, Yankelevich, Zarubin, &amp; Barger, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,172.86,413.36,174.79,8.80" target="#b61">Sonnentag, Arbeus, Mahn, &amp; Fritz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,351.52,413.36,105.47,8.80" target="#b65">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015)</ref>. Psychological detachment seems to be at odds with control experiences with respect to their relationships with specific resources from COR theory: state optimism and self-regulatory capacity. Control seems to protect these resources as COR theory would suggest, but psychological detachment does not. However, the potential costs of psychologically detaching from work on optimism may be less problematic when compared with the potential benefits to resources that result from perceived control over leisure time. Previous studies have not, however, examined the whole process of resource replenishment from activities to experiences to resource replenishment to outcomes. It is necessary to take into account all of these factors in order to discover the unique effects of any one recovery mechanism in relation to another.</p><p>Our results show that resource replenishment after a weekend of recovery contributes to increased work engagement and decreased burnout at the beginning of the next workweek on Monday, as expected by COR theory <ref type="bibr" coords="15,458.77,533.39,59.00,8.80" target="#b24">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. These results are also consistent with research on the job demands-resources model establishing relationships between personal resources and work engagement <ref type="bibr" coords="15,229.67,557.37,105.68,8.80" target="#b80">(Xanthopoulou et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,343.11,557.37,16.93,8.80" target="#b81">(Xanthopoulou et al., , 2009</ref>. Previous research has established that weekend recovery helps prevent or reduce burnout <ref type="bibr" coords="15,261.59,569.39,101.04,8.80" target="#b13">(Fritz &amp; Sonnentag, 2005)</ref>, but this is the first study to demonstrate that replenishing cognitive, affective, and motivational resources-self-regulatory capacity and state optimism-may be responsible for this process. The resource replenishment occurring during the weekend was a better predictor of burnout than of engagement, however. Burnout is a psychological strain, historically a more prototypical outcome of work stressors than engagement is. That is, as noted earlier, strains are adverse psychological (and physical) states due to stressors (reviews by <ref type="bibr" coords="15,171.33,629.37,90.80,8.80" target="#b9">Cooper &amp; Dewe, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,264.36,629.37,95.00,8.80" target="#b27">Kahn &amp; Byosiere, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,361.54,629.37,79.05,8.80" target="#b57">Semmer et al., 2005)</ref>. The stress recovery process, with its emphasis on resource replenishment described by COR theory, may be more applicable to the outcomes that most clearly fit the traditional definition of strains. Again, future research should further examine different outcomes and different resources in order to provide more evidence about this possibility.</p><p>Overall, our results provide some suggestions for which activities are important for replenishing resources in the present study. Spending time especially on social activities and their associated control experiences replenish state optimism and self-regulatory capacity, which, in turn, demonstrate effects on improved work engagement and burnout on Monday <ref type="figure" coords="16,126.03,137.38,34.93,8.80" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2</ref>). Spending weekend hours on work-related activities may not be all bad, because even though it leads to less experience of detachment, the resulting mediation through state optimism predicts less burnout and more engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>The present study developed and tested a model integrating two recovery mechanisms-weekend activities and recovery experiences-with personal resources. This is the first time actual resource replenishment has been integrated into a study of weekend recovery, even though major occupational stress-recovery theories are based on resources and resource replenishment (e.g., COR and ERM; <ref type="bibr" coords="16,301.10,257.40,58.87,8.80" target="#b24">Hobfoll, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,362.84,257.40,105.11,8.80" target="#b37">Meijman &amp; Mulder, 1998)</ref>, making this a major substantive contribution. Examining data collected at different measurement times helped to better illustrate the improvement in personal resources and psychological outcomes at the start of a new work week as a function of potential recovery activities and experiences during off-work time (a weekend). This supports propositions of COR theory, and the ERM that engaging in certain activities during the weekend may be a factor in replenishing resources and improving psychological outcomes for the next workweek.</p><p>As the goal of the study was to assess improvements in the levels of personal resources and psychological outcomes after a weekend of potential recovery activities and experiences, we selected state optimism and self-regulatory capacity, two personal resources that are amenable to change over time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,458.18,353.38,46.76,8.80;16,44.96,365.40,51.83,8.80" target="#b3">Baumeister et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,101.00,365.40,114.12,8.80" target="#b80">Xanthopoulou et al., 2007)</ref>; we note that some other resources cited in COR theory are more trait-like, and therefore should be more difficult to change in spite of the theory's arguments that they ebb and flow (e.g., personality traits or cognitive ability; <ref type="bibr" coords="16,267.01,389.38,102.68,8.80" target="#b21">Halbesleben et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the model predicted changes in state optimism better than in self-regulatory capacity. State optimism and self-regulatory capacity are cognitive, motivational, and emotional resources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,372.14,413.36,88.41,8.80" target="#b29">Kluemper et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,462.91,413.36,42.00,8.80;16,44.96,425.38,73.37,8.80" target="#b76">Twenge &amp; Baumeister, 2002)</ref>, but the self-regulatory capacity measure in the present study was more behavioral, asking employees the extent to which they were self-regulating at work recently. Although self-regulating actions likely indicate available self-regulatory resources <ref type="bibr" coords="16,219.41,449.36,98.03,8.80" target="#b3">(Baumeister et al., 2007)</ref>, weaker prediction of self-regulatory capacity may be due to the measure used. Future research could be aimed at identifying other measures of the self-regulation resource using experimental tasks (e.g., persistence on unsolvable tasks, attention regulation tasks, or inhibition tasks; see <ref type="bibr" coords="16,84.13,485.36,133.92,8.80">Baumeister et al., 2007 for review)</ref>. As internet-based survey technology continues to develop, experimental tasks could be embedded in online questionnaires as well.</p><p>The present study proposed a long causal chain; however, the methodology does not permit strong causal inferences. Specifically, the weekend recovery variables and the Monday resources and psychological outcomes were assessed at the same time, on Monday. However, participants were asked in the Monday survey to retrospectively report about the weekend for the recovery variables, and they were asked about their current (Monday) states for the Monday resources and outcomes. Although they were assessed at the same time, the time referent as well as the use of Friday controls helps disentangle the resource and outcome variables.</p><p>A potential problem could be the data were self-reported, which may result in artificially inflated relationships among the variables due to response biases. The only credible way to measure a person's psychological experiences, resources, and outcomes is using self-report; however, some features of the study reduced the potential for commonmethod problems. Data collection was carried out at more than one point in time, so that transient response biases would have been lessened. Monday's scores on self-regulatory capacity, state optimism, burnout, and work engagement were examined while controlling their Friday scores, and weekend activities were measured as number of hours spent on the activity, which made the measure more objective than a more subjective method such as Likert-type rating scales indicating extent of agreement used for recovery experiences. These are recommended strategies to lessen effects of common method bias <ref type="bibr" coords="17,263.85,101.38,172.73,8.80" target="#b43">(Podsakoff, Mackenzie, &amp; Podsakoff, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,439.21,101.38,55.86,8.80" target="#b70">Spector, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for a traditional, structured work schedule may prevent these results from being generalizable to employees who work non-traditional shifts (e.g., third shift and shiftwork), or do not work a five-day work-week. Some employees have condensed work schedules (four 10-hour days per week), whereas others may work six to seven days a week without structured opportunities for recovery (e.g., a two-day weekend). It would be useful to compare the effectiveness of recovery across different work-recovery schedules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future research</head><p>One recommendation for future research already noted is to study an expanded list of personal resources that may be replenished through recovery. Two personal resources were examined here, self-regulatory capacity and state optimism, but there are other types of resources that may be diminished during the work week and be replenished due to the two recovery mechanisms of weekend activities and experiences. These include other personal resources that have been shown to be malleable and fluctuate across days (e.g., self-efficacy and self-esteem; <ref type="bibr" coords="17,464.94,269.36,57.03,8.80;17,62.02,281.38,46.78,8.80" target="#b80">Xanthopoulou et al., 2007)</ref>. Even though the overall model is well-supported, each specific weekend activity does not lead to all recovery experiences, and each specific experience does not lead to all resources. The variables in the study cover the activities and experiences from previous literature quite well, but the two resources studied do not encompass all of the potential resources as well. Dozens of resources have been named in writings on COR theory <ref type="bibr" coords="17,469.77,317.38,52.24,8.80;17,62.02,329.40,45.43,8.80" target="#b21">(Halbesleben et al., 2014)</ref>, and they probably cannot all be examined in one study, but future research can advance our knowledge by focusing on additional sets of resources.</p><p>Although the activities in the present study encompass a number of potential weekend activities, one specific activity has been understudied in the context of occupational stress recovery: sleep (e.g., . As noted in a review by Akerstedt, Nilsson, and Kecklund (2009), sleep has beneficial effects on subjective and objective alertness and cognitive performance and mood. However, it is not always restorative. Because of the potential detrimental impact of occupational stress (e.g., high job demands and rumination about them) on sleep, recovery activities and their associated recovery experiences (e.g., psychological detachment and relaxation) should make sleep more likely. Future research should investigate these links.</p><p>Although some research has shown that emotional exhaustion <ref type="bibr" coords="17,319.81,437.40,95.01,8.80" target="#b61">(Sonnentag et al., 2014)</ref> or work factors affect how well people psychologically detach from work (stressor-detachment model; <ref type="bibr" coords="17,379.51,449.36,105.29,8.80" target="#b65">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015)</ref>, little is understood regarding why individuals choose particular off-work activities and how that affects different experiences. Personality affects not only the situations individuals choose but also how they react to situations <ref type="bibr" coords="17,62.02,485.36,57.45,8.80" target="#b17">(Funder, 2010)</ref>, and there may be better fit of some personality types with specific recovery activities. For example, we propose that employees with extraverted personalities would be more likely to choose and be more favorably affected by social off-work activities, and conscientious employees would be likely to engage in further work-related activities during nonwork hours. Aside from stable variables like personality, pre-weekend conditions like Friday well-being or personal resources, and situational contingencies like the previous week's work demands also might alter recovery effects in the model. As suggested earlier, employees who are behind on their work might benefit from doing more work activities on the weekend and from experiencing less detachment than other employees. People who are more depleted at the end of the work week (i.e., lower self-regulatory capacity, higher burnout) may spend more time on low effort activities because they do not have enough resources available to engage in physical activities. Future recovery research should investigate the role of individual difference and moderators in the model.</p><p>A major issue regarding work stress interventions is whether to focus on reducing the causes (stressors) of the strains or to focus on reducing strains directly. The present study's focus was testing a central tenet of COR theory <ref type="bibr" coords="17,62.02,629.37,61.74,8.80" target="#b24">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>, that resources could be and need to be recovered to help reduce strains, which is closer to the second of these two approaches. It appears that this resource recovery proposal of the theory actually can occur and that such resource recovery can be aided by some activities and experiences commonly advocated in occupational stress recovery research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="18,166.34,89.36,69.67,8.80" target="#b60">Sonnentag, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,239.48,89.36,93.58,8.80" target="#b75">Trougakos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,336.60,89.36,135.19,8.80">review by Sonnentag et al., 2012)</ref>. Future research should also address the other approach to occupational stress treatments (i.e., treatments that reduce work stressors; <ref type="bibr" coords="18,83.45,113.40,103.82,8.80" target="#b4">Beehr &amp; O'Driscoll, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>Along with the previously noted implications our results have for future model building, our findings have implications for practice. In addition to stressful working conditions being harmful to the employee's well-being, they can result in lowered job performance (meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" coords="18,229.72,196.91,168.64,8.80" target="#b19">Gilboa, Shirom, Fried, &amp; Cooper, 2008)</ref>. Some of that effect on performance is likely due to the employees' lowered readiness to exert energy and concentration if they cannot recover from their strains. The present study helps to determine likely paths to recovery. Research on weekend activities is more open to practical implications than research on recovery experiences and personal resources separately, because it is easier to recommend which behaviors or activities employees should engage in rather than trying to directly manipulate the more subjective experiences or resources. That is, it would be more clear to recommend that employees take "a fivehour dose" of socializing with friends during the weekend than to recommend that they "feel control" during the weekend. Unfortunately, however, present knowledge of efficacious recovery activities is nowhere near such precision.</p><p>Control experiences predicted resource replenishment and favorable outcomes better than the other recovery experiences, and working backward in the model's results in <ref type="figure" coords="18,298.83,304.91,33.29,8.80" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, spending more weekend hours on social activities and less on work-related activities were the best predictors of those control experiences. Therefore, in order for employees to rebuild resources and have better outcomes, the most direct recommendation from the results is to increase their social activities and decrease their work-related activities on weekends. A caveat about reducing workrelated activities noted earlier, however, is that work-related activities' effects on replenishment of state optimism may actually be favorable. There are probably employees who need to accomplish some work on the weekends in order to feel optimistic about their work on the following Monday.</p><p>Weekends allow enough time for employees to do many different things; some have beneficial effects on resource replenishment (and ultimately effects on outcomes) through recovery experiences, but also, some do not. Before we know more about additional resources besides state optimism and self-regulatory capacity, the findings suggest that employees should consider the effects of their engagement in different weekend activities (especially social, work-related, and household/childcare activities), because each is associated with different recovery effects.</p><p>Terry Beehr is a professor in the I/O Psychology Ph.D. Program at Central Michigan University.
