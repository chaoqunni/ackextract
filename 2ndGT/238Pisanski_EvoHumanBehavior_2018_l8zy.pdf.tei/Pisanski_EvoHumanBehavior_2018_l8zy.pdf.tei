<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A B S T R A C T</head><p>Women's voice pitch (the perceptual correlate of fundamental frequency, F0) varies across the menstrual cycle and lowers after menopause, and may represent a putative signal of women's fertility and reproductive age. Yet, despite dramatic changes in women's sex hormone levels and bodies during and after pregnancy, previous between-subject and case studies have not found systematic changes in F0 due to pregnancy. Here, we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers' voices during their first pregnancy, as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum. Voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control. Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean, range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls. Mothers' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before. These F0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing. Although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy, mothers' F0 parameters reverted after the first year postpartum, approaching pre-pregnancy levels. Our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinizing effect on women's voices.</p></div>

This sex difference emerges following a pubertal surge in the androgen levels of adolescent boys that masculinizes the larynx, lengthening and thickening the male vocal folds and resulting in a voice pitch that is around 75% lower in adult men than women <ref type="bibr" coords="1,130.16,543.84,46.42,7.17" target="#b51">(Titze, 1989)</ref>. Fundamental frequency also varies considerably within the sexes. Numerous studies, focusing mostly on men, have linked individual differences in men's F0 to testosterone levels, facial masculinity, social dominance, and number of sex partners <ref type="bibr" coords="1,37.59,585.68,137.97,7.17">(Pisanski and Bryant, 2018 for review)</ref>. There is therefore strong consensus that low F0 has been sexually selected in men to communicate threat potential and mate quality <ref type="bibr" coords="1,158.79,606.60,62.92,7.17" target="#b38">(Puts et al., 2016)</ref>, and constitutes a secondary sex characteristic <ref type="bibr" coords="1,139.63,617.03,57.99,7.17" target="#b17">(Feinberg, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Women's voices, while comparatively less studied, also appear to communicate reproductive potential and fertility, and predict men's mate preferences. Men show preferences for indices of femininity and youth in women's traits, including high mean F0 in women's voices, presumably because these traits suggest a woman is of reproductive age and potentially fecund <ref type="bibr" coords="1,390.16,439.19,106.48,7.17" target="#b36">(Pisanski and Feinberg, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,499.52,439.19,58.12,7.17;1,306.59,449.67,54.77,7.17" target="#b39">Puts, Jones, and DeBruine, 2012</ref> for reviews).

Indeed, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies show that women's F0 either decreases gradually or stays relatively constant (barring cyclic fluctuations, see below) throughout their reproductive years, but consistently report a 10-35 Hz decrease in women's F0 following menopause <ref type="bibr" coords="1,338.06,522.92,131.09,7.17" target="#b0">(Abitbol, Abitbol, and Abitbol, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,471.63,522.92,85.97,7.17;1,306.60,533.35,19.32,7.17" target="#b3">Amir and Biron-Shental, 2004)</ref>. This drop in F0 may be caused by menopausal decreases in estrogens and increases in androgens resulting in swelling (edema) that alters the thickness and mass of the vocal folds <ref type="bibr" coords="1,473.32,554.27,55.52,7.17" target="#b15">(Derman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,531.04,554.27,26.56,7.17;1,306.59,564.76,111.84,7.17" target="#b27">Hirano, Kurita, and Nakashima, 1983)</ref>.

Taken together, there is good evidence that a woman's voice pitch can indicate whether she is of reproductive age.</p><p>Studies have also shown intra-individual fluctuations in women's F0 across the menstrual cycle, suggesting that F0 may indicate cycle-tocycle changes in fertility.

Although hormonal contraceptive usage, which stabilizes the cyclical variation in women's hormone levels, does not appear to predict differences in women's mean F0, lower levels of vocal perturbation among women taking monophasic birth control pills have been attributed to a stable hormonal balance leading to increased regularity in vocal fold vibration <ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.45,143.48,144.79,7.17" target="#b4">(Amir, Biron-Shental, and Shabtai, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, the vocal folds appear particularly sensitive to sex hormone levels which are known to fluctuate throughout the life cycle.

Many women also experience behavioural and psychological changes such as increased fatigue, changes in self-perception or selfpresentation (e.g., perceived attractiveness and competency), and reduced mating motivation.

The authors reported no systematic changes in mean F0 throughout pregnancy. None of these studies measured women's voices before becoming pregnant, and thus lacked a baseline for intra-individual comparison.</p><p>Several limitations may have contributed to the null results reported in these previous studies, and we designed our study to specifically address these issues. First, between-subject designs can introduce confounds due to demographic differences between pregnant and nonpregnant women, as well as individual differences in their baseline vocal parameters, whereas case studies entirely ignore between-individual variation. Second, no study has measured women's voices before conception. This makes it impossible to know from previous work whether F0 measured during or after pregnancy was different from women's pre-pregnant (i.e., baseline) levels. Third, in previous studies, voice measures were taken from scripted speech including vowel sounds and short read passages, rather than free speech that is naturally more variable. Finally, no study has examined the effect of pregnancy on F0 range (min and max) or variation, despite subjective reports on various websites and blogs from singers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,467.60,321.26,38.11,7.17">C.S., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,507.80,321.26,49.87,7.17" target="#b19">Gerson, 2013)</ref> or voice coaches/therapists (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.86,331.75,54.55,7.17" target="#b16">Emerich, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,485.35,331.75,47.38,7.17" target="#b21">Gupta, 2018)</ref> of difficulty reaching high frequencies during or after pregnancy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Present study</head><p>Here, we acoustically analysed archival recordings of 20 women experiencing their first pregnancy <ref type="table" coords="2,427.01,403.64,35.22,7.17" target="#tab_0">(Table S1a</ref>). We measured changes in F0 parameters before pregnancy (5 years), during pregnancy, and after pregnancy (5 years), and compared this to voice measures taken from 20 age-matched nulliparous controls <ref type="table" coords="2,438.29,434.99,36.97,7.17" target="#tab_0">(Table S1b</ref>) during corresponding timeframes.

Voice recordings were categorized into 5 pregnancy phases spanning approximately 10 years of each mother's life.

The long-term (LT) pre-pregnancy and postpartum phases each spanned a period of 4 years before and after the short-term phases, respectively. The long-term pre-pregnancy phase acted as a within-subject control phase to test whether F0 decreased within-individuals due to ageing prior to having ever conceived a child. The long-term postpartum phase acted as a recovery phase to test whether changes in F0 were transient or long lasting, and excluded clips during which some women were pregnant with a second child. As an additional control, data were collected from nulliparous controls during age-matched timeframes corresponding to the pregnancy and postpartum phases of mothers. during each phase <ref type="table" coords="3,107.26,59.80,36.17,7.17">(Table S2)</ref>.

Each model included participant identity as a subject variable with random intercept and phase/timeframe as a fixed factor. To control for the potential effect of ageing on F0, women's age at the time of voice recording was included as a random covariate. Mother's age at parturition (childbirth), included as a fixed covariate, showed no effect (all F &lt; 2.9, all P &gt; 0.103), and the corresponding age of nulliparous controls also showed no effect (all F &lt; 1.03, P &gt; 0.323), and was therefore excluded from final models. Significant effects were further examined using pairwise tests with Šidák correction for multiple comparisons. In our sample of mothers, residuals were computed for each F0 parameter controlling for participant identity (random intercept) and mother's age at voice recording (fixed covariate).

Thus, in the year following the birth of their first child, women's F0 parameters dropped on average by 14.6 Hz (F0 mean), 13.6 Hz (F0 min), a sizeable 43.7 Hz (F0 max), 8 Hz (F0 sd), and 0.022 Hz (F0 CV) compared to the year prior to conception.

However, in the months after giving birth, women's estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol levels decrease dramatically compared to pregnancy levels. In addition to potentially inducing postpartum depression in some women <ref type="bibr" coords="4,251.08,561.87,37.56,7.17;4,37.59,572.36,95.82,7.17" target="#b25">(Hendrick, Altshuler, and Suri, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,137.37,572.36,70.80,7.17" target="#b31">Mehta et al., 2014)</ref>, abrupt drops in sex steroid levels may affect F0 by acting directly on hormone receptors on the vocal folds or indirectly on neural laryngeal control <ref type="bibr" coords="4,242.69,593.28,45.94,7.17;4,37.59,603.71,52.68,7.17" target="#b26">(Higgins and Saxman, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,92.97,603.71,75.97,7.17" target="#b32">Newman et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Postpartum decreases in F0 may also be a product of behavioural changes. Women experience increased mental and physical fatigue during the first year of childrearing, as well as changes in mood. Although robust evidence that fatigue decreases women's F0 is lacking <ref type="bibr" coords="4,37.59,656.04,118.36,7.17" target="#b13">(Cho, Yin, Park, and Park, 2011)</ref>, voice pitch plays a key role in the communication of emotion and affect <ref type="bibr" coords="4,170.93,666.47,117.71,7.17;4,37.58,676.96,19.32,7.17" target="#b48">(Sauter, Eisner, Calder, and Scott, 2010)</ref>. Alternatively, women may behaviorally modulate their voices. There is growing evidence that women and men speak with a lower F0 in specific social contexts, particularly when experiencing (or wishing to portray) a high degree of competence and authority <ref type="bibr" coords="4,229.43,708.31,59.18,7.17;4,37.59,718.80,125.68,7.17" target="#b35">(Pisanski, Cartei, McGettigan, Raine, and Reby, 2016)</ref>. New mothers may also experience decreased motivation to volitionally raise their voice pitch. Although a high voice pitch in women can signal youth and femininity to potential mates, it is likewise associated with perceptions of immaturity and submissiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="4,362.21,436.35,96.27,7.17" target="#b34">(Pisanski and Bryant, 2018</ref> for review).</p><p>The magnitude of voice pitch changes observed in our sample of women was large.

Such voice changes are likely to be easily perceptible as they are well beyond the just-noticeable differences in voice pitch perception <ref type="bibr" coords="4,507.91,520.03,49.73,7.17;4,306.59,530.52,52.11,7.17" target="#b37">(Pisanski and Rendall, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,361.59,530.52,155.50,7.17" target="#b41">Re, O'Connor, Bennett, and Feinberg, 2012)</ref>. However, playback studies are now needed to test whether listeners can discriminate mother's voices recorded in pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum phases, or can differentiate mothers from non-mothers from the voice alone. In addition, while the effects of a relatively low-pitched and monotonous (i.e., masculine) voice on listeners' biosocial judgments are well documented <ref type="bibr" coords="4,411.81,593.28,99.33,7.17" target="#b34">(Pisanski and Bryant, 2018</ref> for review), playback studies are also needed to assess whether postpartum decreases in voice pitch influence listeners' voice-based judgments of new mothers.</p><p>The aim of this study was to test whether women's voice pitch changes during or after pregnancy relative to before conception, and to what extent, employing methods that address many of the shortcomings of previous investigations (i.e., we use a longitudinal design; include a "pre-pregnancy" baseline phase; utilize natural rather than scripted speech; and measure multiple pitch parameters). The use of archival recordings allowed us to readily explore this research question by analyzing within-individual changes in women's voice pitch over a span of 10 years. This would be difficult with real-time voice recording, particularly recording women's voices before conception. However, in future work, voice recordings collected as part of a planned longitudinal , and significant differences among phases/ timeframes are shown for planned comparisons following Šidák correction, where *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001.

Each mother is represented by a unique colour, and each mother's residuals are plotted separately for each phase. A gray line is drawn connecting phase means. LT Pre = long-term pre-pregnancy (4 years); ST Pre = short-term pre-pregnancy (1 year); pregnancy (9 months); ST Post = short-term postpartum (1 year); LT Post = long-term postpartum (4 years).</p><p>study will have the benefit of allowing researchers to also systematically measure and control for other variables to examine covariation in F0, sex hormone levels, and behavioural measures and thus to better understand the mechanisms driving postpartum voice changes. More generally, longitudinal measures of hormone levels and vocal parameters across the lifetime could reveal whether large hormonal shifts predict large changes in pitch. Researchers may also test whether women who adopt children or acquire a child through surrogacy show decreases in F0 parameters. If so, this could suggest that the mechanism is at least partially behavioural. Questionnaire data could help reveal whether greater subjective experience of fatigue, mood changes or postpartum depression predicts larger decreases in voice pitch in the year after parturition. Finally, future work may examine whether women's F0 parameters also drop following the birth of subsequent children, and whether these voice changes are amplified following a multiple birth (e.g., twins). Our sample of mothers and nulliparous controls included actresses, journalists or reporters, celebrities, and singers. Although these women are performers or public figures by profession, all voice recordings used in this study (from both mothers and controls) were taken from unscripted interviews in which the women were not explicitly acting. Moreover, while it is possible that the voice changes we observed were partially behavioural (i.e., voice modulation), we did not observe analogous voice changes in nulliparous controls whose professions matched those of the mothers, suggesting that profession cannot itself explain our pattern of results. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out an interaction between profession and pregnancy phase. Future longitudinal work utilizing a larger sample of women in a wider range of professions, and cultures, is now clearly needed to establish the replicability and generalisability of our results.</p><p>Although our data cannot offer an answer to the question of whether postpartum voice changes represent an evolved signal or a byproduct, this is an important question worth considering here, and testing in future work, particularly given the known influence of voice pitch on social and reproductive success, and its potential role in communicating female fertility and fecundity (e.g., ovulation and menopause: <ref type="bibr" coords="5,262.60,425.92,26.01,7.17;5,37.59,436.35,42.14,7.17" target="#b0">Abitbol et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,81.98,436.35,107.84,7.17" target="#b3">Amir and Biron-Shental, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,192.07,436.35,96.56,7.17" target="#b8">Bryant and Haselton, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,37.59,446.84,61.35,7.17">Çelik et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,100.86,446.84,67.74,7.17" target="#b18">Fischer et al., 2011)</ref>. While it is possible that selection could operate on women to honestly communicate, or deceptively exaggerate or suppress, postpartum state, or on men to reliably detect the reproductive states of women (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,190.26,478.19,98.32,7.17;5,37.59,488.68,19.32,7.17" target="#b24">Haselton and Gildersleeve, 2011)</ref>, the most parsimonious explanation for our results is that postpartum changes in women's voices reflect a byproduct of physiological, anatomical and/or behavioural changes following pregnancy. To test these competing hypotheses, additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms driving postpartum voice changes, as described above, and their potential influence on listeners.</p></div>

We then excluded women (n = 9) for whom we could not find 10 years' worth of frequent (i.e., at least bi-monthly), standardized, high-quality voice recordings spanning several years before and after their first pregnancy. Our final sample of mothers included 20 women, who were born between the years 1966 and 1987 and were between 27 and 41 years of age (mean 35.3) when their first child was born ( <ref type="table" coords="5,269.86,708.37,18.75,7.17;5,37.59,718.80,14.31,7.17" target="#tab_0">Table  S1a)</ref>. As voice recordings were collected up to 5 years before and after childbirth, mothers' ages at time of voice recording ranged from 22.6 to 49.7.

To match our sample size of mothers, we terminated our search once we had obtained data from 20 nulliparous controls. These women were born between 1958 and 1980, and were thus agematched to our sample of mothers at parturition (mean age 36.08), such that the age of each nulliparous control matched the age of one given mother at parturition by an average of ± 10.7 months (min 1.2 months, max 34.8 months; <ref type="table" coords="5,372.70,164.39,33.29,7.17" target="#tab_0">Table S1b</ref>).

We searched for interviews that took place within the allotted timeframe by inputting each woman's name, the word "interview", and the dates of interest into Google Videos or UCLA search engines. Interview dates were then verified through the UCLA database and by cross-sourcing with online databases (e.g., television guides; Internet Movie Database). Inclusion criteria for interview clips were a lack of strong emotional content, shouting, and background noise. We searched for and randomly selected 4 clips per phase/timeframe for each woman that met these criteria, attaining an average of 4.4 ± 2.2 interviews per phase for each mother <ref type="table" coords="5,446.74,436.35,37.65,7.17">(Table S2a</ref>) and 3.8 ± 2.7 interviews per corresponding timeframe for each nulliparous control <ref type="table" coords="5,306.60,457.27,40.46,7.17">(Table S2b)</ref>.

We measured 5 parameters of fundamental frequency: mean (F0 mean), minimum (F0 min), maximum, (F0 max), standard deviation (F0 sd), and the coefficient of variation (F0 CV) using Praat's autocorrelation algorithm with a search range of 60-600 Hz and a time step of 0.01 s. Whereas F0 mean represents average voice pitch, and F0 min and max represent its range, F0 sd and CV represent pitch variability. A less variable, more monotonous voice will have lower values of F0 sd. However, because F0 sd decreases as F0 mean increases, we additionally measured F0 CV that represents pitch variability corrected for mean (F0 sd/F0 mean).
