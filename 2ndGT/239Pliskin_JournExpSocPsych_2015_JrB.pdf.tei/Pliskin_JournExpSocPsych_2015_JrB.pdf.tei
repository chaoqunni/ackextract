<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We examine how context and ideology moderate fear's effect on flight intentions. • Context, ideology and fear interactively affect willingness to consider flight.</p><p>• When ideology is irrelevant, fear increases only rightists' flight intentions.</p><p>• In ideologically-relevant contexts, fear increases only leftists' flight intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>Fear is a powerful motivator for the classic fight or flight response. Under extreme social and political circumstances, fear may lead people to emigrate from their land to protect themselves and their families. While ideology is related to differences in behavioral fear reactivity, little is known about how it moderates the effect of fear on flight intentions. In a large experimental study (N = 243), we examined our hypothesis that this moderating effect is context-dependent, such that the context's relation to the ideology determines its influence. In ideologically-irrelevant contexts, because rightists (versus leftists) are assumed to be more behaviorally reactive to fear, their willingness to consider flight should be more affected. In ideologically-relevant intergroup contexts, however, rightist ideology provides clear reaction guidelines ruling out flight, and therefore fear should have a weaker effect on rightists' (versus leftists') flight tendencies. Our findings supported these predictions, and their significance is discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>context, in which events are often beyond the personal control of individuals. Studies show that in such contexts, experiences of threat and fear lead to increased support for risk-aversive and defensive political policies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.79,89.16,55.91,7.54" target="#b19">Halperin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.90,89.16,129.75,7.54;2,42.52,99.65,19.85,7.54" target="#b32">Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, &amp; Fischhoff, 2003)</ref>, decreased support for confrontational policies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,267.08,99.65,26.42,7.54;2,42.52,110.08,110.96,7.54" target="#b25">Huddy, Feldman, Taber, &amp; Lahav, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,155.56,110.08,138.00,7.54;2,42.52,120.57,19.85,7.54" target="#b48">Skitka, Bauman, Aramovich, &amp; Morgan, 2006)</ref>, and increased motivation to avoid a threatening outgroup (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,61.23,131.06,88.59,7.54" target="#b37">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,151.48,131.06,62.86,7.54" target="#b48">Skitka et al., 2006)</ref>. Furthermore, studies have shown that threats to the group lead to greater personal avoidance tendencies, with people reporting cancelling travel plans and avoiding mass transportation in light of fear (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.91,162.41,101.62,7.54;2,42.52,172.89,49.76,7.54" target="#b24">Huddy, Feldman, Capelos, &amp; Provost, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>As stated above, because of limited individual influence over many collectively-relevant threats, one readily available option for personal action in such situations may be fleeing the area in which the threat is present. In collective contexts in which threats are continuously or repeatedly present, flight may involve drastic measures and great costs-because to avoid the threatening context altogether the individual would have to physically leave the area inhabited by the group, which is often a region of political significance such as a state. In certain contexts, such as in the midst of intergroup conflicts, physical flight may be viewed as socially illegitimate, exposing the individual to social criticism for not facing the threat together with fellow group members. Indeed, individuals fleeing their countries in the wake of political conflict are often regarded as traitors, or given derogatory descriptions such as the one coined by former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin to describe Jews moving away from Israel during the turbulent 1970s: "fall-outs of weaklings" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,127.28,340.25,131.56,7.54">(Israeli Broadcasting Authority, 1976)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ideology and conflict-related ideology in collective contexts</head><p>Because of the benefits and costs associated with fleeing, individuals may differ in their willingness to consider this option. Differences in flight intentions may stem from factors such as trait anxiety, personal connections abroad, socio-economic status, and more. In sociopolitical contexts, one such differentiating factor is political ideology: a stable "interrelated set of attitudes, values, and beliefs with cognitive, affective, and motivational properties" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,183.01,455.28,110.58,7.54;2,42.52,465.77,24.96,7.54">(Jost, Federico, &amp; Napier, 2009, p. 315)</ref>. According to recent research, ideologies relate to both the contents of beliefs and the needs underlying them, with people tending to adopt ideologies that fulfill their own dominant needs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.55,486.69,38.97,7.54;2,42.52,497.17,19.26,7.54" target="#b28">(Jost et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In violent intergroup contexts, ideological belief systems relating to the conflict receive widespread support <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.71,518.09,50.27,7.54" target="#b2">(Bar-Tal, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.82,518.09,22.74,7.54;2,42.52,528.52,19.73,7.54" target="#b10">Cohrs, 2012)</ref>, as rightist ideology is generally associated with greater intergroup bias <ref type="bibr" coords="2,82.09,539.01,63.86,7.54" target="#b0">(Altemeyer, 1996)</ref>. Rightist, conflict-supporting ideology in these contexts takes on specific contents, leading to greater adherence to certain societal beliefs, including beliefs regarding patriotism, security, and unity. Specifically, societal beliefs about patriotism focus on loyalty and sacrifice for the collective; beliefs about security emphasize the importance of personal and national survival and modes of achieving it; and beliefs about unity emphasize the importance of facing the opponent as a cohesive unit (Bar-Tal, 2013). These beliefs may limit individual willingness to consider flight, and may also shape responses to the experience of fear described above.</p><p>Extensive research has indicated that these context-specific ideological beliefs influence not only the attitudes (Bar-Tal, Sharvit, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.87,654.05,39.72,7.54;2,42.52,664.53,47.83,7.54" target="#b4">Halperin, &amp; Zafran, 2012)</ref>, but also the behaviors (e.g., information seeking, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,674.97,116.25,7.54" target="#b39">Porat, Halperin, &amp; Bar-Tal, 2013)</ref> of individuals in societies involved in intractable conflicts. Although research has not directly examined the ideology-flight relationship (but see recent work on migration to ideologically-similar communities, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,175.24,706.37,118.35,7.54;2,42.52,716.80,45.69,7.54" target="#b34">Motyl, Iyer, Oishi, Trawalter, &amp; Nosek, 2014)</ref>, there are indications in the literature that the beliefs of individuals are a key motivation behind the decision not to leave one's home in perilous times (e.g., Gidron, Peleg, Jaffe, &amp; Shenhar, 2010).</p><p>The interactive effect of fear and ideology on willingness to consider flight While it is clear that fear and ideology play important roles in collective contexts, little is known about their interactive influence. Could rightists and leftists be differentially motivated by fear? Could their willingness to consider fleeing be more or less influenced by their heightened experience of fear? Our goal in the present research was to examine these as-of-yet unexamined questions. Nonetheless, the literature contains several clues that lead to seemingly conflicting predictions, especially when examining fear in intergroup contexts.</p><p>On one hand, recent accounts of ideology indicate that rightists and leftists differ from one another in fear reactivity, such that rightists have an over-activated fear response (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,444.92,193.81,73.20,7.54" target="#b6">Block &amp; Block, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,520.27,193.81,41.28,7.54;2,310.51,204.24,120.94,7.54">Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, &amp; Sulloway, 2003a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,433.81,204.24,127.74,7.54" target="#b31">Kanai, Feilden, Firth, &amp; Rees, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,310.51,214.73,63.82,7.54" target="#b36">Oxley et al., 2008)</ref>, and that these differences explain many right-left motivational differences (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,420.09,225.16,77.62,7.54" target="#b27">Jost &amp; Amodio, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,500.09,225.16,57.48,7.54" target="#b28">Jost et al., 2009)</ref>. Importantly, brain research has also demonstrated right-left differences specifically relevant to avoidance tendencies, with the processing of "conservative" statements associated with greater activity in brain regions associated with withdrawal motivations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,497.70,267.00,63.79,7.54;2,310.50,277.49,154.90,7.54" target="#b53">(Zamboni, Gozzi, Krueger, Duhamel, Sirigu, &amp; Grafman, 2009)</ref>. A review of the empirical literature has recently suggested that rightists have greater negativity bias in general, and their greater attention to negative occurrences leads them to take more steps to avoid such occurrences <ref type="bibr" coords="2,526.96,308.84,34.54,7.54;2,310.50,319.32,80.68,7.54" target="#b23">(Hibbing, Smith, &amp; Alford, 2014)</ref>. These findings indicate that rightists may be more behaviorally reactive to fear-inducing stimuli in several ways, and such greater reactivity may lead to the prediction that fear would have a greater impact on rightists' (compared to leftists') willingness to consider flight.</p><p>On the other hand, the specific contents of rightist ideology in certain contexts may lead to a competing prediction, that fearful rightists would be less motivated than fearful leftists to consider flight. As stated earlier, rightist ideology is associated with patriotism (Bar-Tal, 2013), and specifically blind patriotism <ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.24,413.44,95.26,7.54;2,310.51,423.93,19.85,7.54" target="#b45">(Schatz, Staub, &amp; Lavine, 1999)</ref>, and such patriotism promotes self-sacrifice, the opposite of physical flight from danger, especially in intergroup conflict situations. These beliefs should be most powerful with regard to patriotismrelevant units-namely, one's land and nation-and leaving these may be particularly at odds with patriotic beliefs. Right-wing beliefs in conflict situations are also associated with beliefs regarding security-and the modes of achieving it through confrontation-and unity-and its importance in facing the threatening outgroup <ref type="bibr" coords="2,481.54,497.18,49.09,7.54" target="#b3">(Bar-Tal, 2013</ref>). These firm beliefs should limit rightists' willingness to consider fleeing, even when experiencing fear. Additionally, the literature suggests that rightist ideology is associated with over-active fear responses and needs for certainty and security precisely because it functions to reduce fear and answer these needs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,383.47,549.45,59.31,7.54" target="#b28">(Jost et al., 2009)</ref>. It follows that rightist ideology, in answering these needs, regulates the effects of fear by providing clear guidelines on how to react to ideologically-relevant threats-a notion supported by findings on ideological differences in the impact of emotions on policy support <ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.15,591.29,138.40,7.54;2,310.51,601.77,19.54,7.54" target="#b38">(Pliskin, Bar-Tal, Sheppes, &amp; Halperin, 2014)</ref>. These factors support a prediction that rightists' (compared to leftists') willingness to consider flight would be less affected by fear, at least in ideologically relevant intergroup contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The present research</head><p>The relevant literatures therefore lead to two seemingly contradictory predictions. Nonetheless, we argue that the contradiction can be settled by acknowledging the moderating role context plays in the relationship among ideology, fear and the willingness to consider flight. In other words, along the lines of research demonstrating that right-left differences in threat sensitivity, risk-aversion, and negativity bias are domain specific <ref type="bibr" coords="2,374.85,727.29,186.70,7.54" target="#b9">(Choma, Hanoch, Hodson, &amp; Gummerum, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,310.50,737.78,126.33,7.54" target="#b12">Federico, Johnston, &amp; Lavine, 2014)</ref>, we believe that both predictions arising from the literature have merit, but the differential effects of fear on rightists and leftists are context-dependent.</p><p>As the literature indicates, rightists have a comparatively overactivated fear response, and such higher reactivity may go unchecked in the absence of clear reaction guidelines. Thus, in contexts unrelated to ideological beliefs, we hypothesize fear will have a greater impact on the willingness of rightists (versus leftists) to consider flight. On the other hand, when fear arises from ideologically-relevant developments relating to an adversarial outgroup, rightist ideology may provide clearer guidelines on how to behaviorally react. Thus, in such ideologically-relevant contexts, we hypothesize that rightists' willingness to consider flight will be less fear-driven than that of leftists.</p><p>To examine these hypotheses, we conducted a large experimental study examining the interactive effects of ideology and fear on willingness to consider flight in two different contexts. We predicted that context would moderate the interactive effect of induced fear and ideology, such that in an ideologically-irrelevant context, rightists' (compared to leftists') willingness to consider flight would be more affected by fear, but in an ideologically-relevant intergroup context, rightists' (compared to leftists') willingness to consider flight would be less affected by fear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A sample of 243 Jewish Israelis (170 females; ages 18-87, M = 33.83, SD = 14.9), drawn from the general population and the student body at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, voluntarily participated in an online study. We determined the sample size based on the 3way interaction design, striving to have 30 participants in each "cell" (functionally treating the ideology variable as dichotomous rather than continuous). Of this initial sample, we excluded two participants who did not reside in Israel and seven who had unreasonable questionnaire-completion times (over 1 h), 1 yielding a final sample of 234 participants (163 female; ages 18-87, M = 33.74, SD = 14.87). Politically, the sample was relatively balanced, with 37.61% of participants identifying as moderately to extremely rightist, 32.05% as centrist, and 30.34% as moderately to extremely leftist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants were randomly assigned to conditions in a 2 (context: ideologically-irrelevant or ideologically-relevant) × 2 (fear-inducing or secure) between-subjects design and filled out an online questionnaire. The questionnaire began with a contrived report from a leading Israeli news website (see Supplementary material for the full texts of the four versions of this report) on either an approaching epidemic (an ideologically-irrelevant threat) or an approaching Palestinian revolt ("Intifada," i.e., an ideologically-relevant threat from an adversarial outgroup).</p><p>Following the long tradition of appraisal theorists of emotions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,56.24,603.08,61.23,7.54" target="#b41">Roseman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,122.28,603.08,51.39,7.54" target="#b46">Scherer, 1999</ref>; and see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,217.76,603.08,67.02,7.54;3,33.73,613.57,78.82,7.54" target="#b33">Moors, Ellsworth, Scherer, &amp; Frijda, 2013</ref>, for a special section on appraisal theories), we manipulated fear by manipulating the appraisals associated with it: the presence of a highly probable threat and low coping abilities with this threat. Manipulating emotions by manipulating their core appraisal themes is a common practice in research on emotions, both in general (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,52.89,665.84,98.17,7.54" target="#b1">Aue, Flykt, &amp; Scherer, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,153.07,665.84,89.41,7.54" target="#b11">Ellsworth &amp; Smith, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,244.56,665.84,40.23,7.54;3,33.73,676.33,57.60,7.54" target="#b42">Roseman &amp; Evdokas, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,95.81,676.33,99.44,7.54" target="#b43">Russell &amp; McAuley, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,199.72,676.33,49.07,7.54" target="#b49">Smith, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,253.24,676.33,31.50,7.54;3,33.73,686.76,50.92,7.54" target="#b50">Smith &amp; Lazarus, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,86.51,686.76,82.76,7.54" target="#b52">van Reekum et al., 2004</ref>; and the comprehensive review by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,44.67,697.25,126.85,7.54">Scherer, Schorr, &amp; Johnstone, 2001)</ref> and in political, group-relevant contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,87.31,707.68,137.85,7.54" target="#b15">Goldenberg, Saguy, &amp; Halperin, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,227.56,707.68,57.18,7.54" target="#b18">Halperin, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,301.72,57.80,146.60,7.54" target="#b21">Halperin, Russell, Dweck, &amp; Gross, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,450.53,57.80,67.50,7.54" target="#b38">Pliskin et al., 2014)</ref>. Thus, in the secure condition, Israeli officials are quoted assuring that Israel has the capability to significantly mitigate the approaching threat's impact and the tools to deal with its ramifications, stressing that there is little room for worry. In the fear-inducing condition, however, these officials state that Israel will be unable to prevent the threat and lacks the tools to deal with its ramifications effectively, stressing that the blow may be extremely severe. Anticipating possible right-left differences in levels of fear, we worded the fear condition so as to guarantee that the content was strong enough to raise fear across the ideological spectrum. The text was followed by manipulation checks for levels of fear and items measuring willingness to consider flight from Israel 2 in light of the approaching threat.</p><p>To ensure that this manipulation was suited for our aims, we conducted a pilot study examining whether the scenarios differed in their perceived ideological relevance, raised similar levels of fear, and targeted fear specifically. Drawn from an online panel, 140 participants (70 female; ages 19-81, M = 37.78, SD = 14.06; with eight excluded for failing to follow instructions) 3 were randomly assigned to read one of the four texts and responded to measures of perceived ideological relevance (4-item measure, e.g., "people on the political left and right will tend to respond differently to the report presented," Cronbach's α = 0.7), fear in response to the threat (5-item measure, e.g., "fear of the events' ramifications for Israeli society," Cronbach's α = 0.94), and other discrete negative emotions in response to the threat (sadness, disgust, and despair, each measured using one item). We ran a series of 3way interaction analyses (fear manipulation × context × ideology) employing Hayes' (2013) PROCESS regression procedure (model 3), 4 controlling for age, sex, whether participants had family abroad, and personal history living abroad (variables that were also controlled for in all analyses reported in our main study below).</p><p>The first analysis confirmed that the epidemic scenario was perceived as less ideologically-relevant than the Palestinian uprising scenario, B = 1.36, .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The manipulation's effect on fear and other emotions</head><p>To ensure our manipulation raised levels of fear across scenarios and ideological positions, we conducted an analysis employing PROCESS Model 3, signifying the fear manipulation as an independent variable, ideology as the primary moderator, and the scenario as the secondary moderator, R 2 = . <ref type="bibr" coords="4,117.41,539.02,42.59,8.28">19, F (11,221)</ref>  We then ran two separate moderation analyses employing PROCESS Model 1 to examine whether, in each scenario (ideologically-irrelevant scenario: R 2 = .21, F (7,103) = 3.88, p b .001; ideologically-relevant scenario, R 2 = .23, F (7,114) = 4.85, p = .0001), the manipulation raised levels of context-specific fears. The analyses revealed the manipulation significantly increased context-specific fears in both scenarios Fear, ideology and the willingness to consider flight in politically-irrelevant and relevant contexts Next, we examined our hypothesis that ideology would moderate the manipulation's effect on willingness to consider flight, but that the nature of this moderating effect would be context-dependent. To this end, we employed the 3-way interaction procedure described above, R 2 = .28, F (11,217) = 7.76, p b .0001. In addition to finding a main effect for the fear manipulation on willingness to consider flight (B = .45, SE = .14, t = 3.16, p b .005, [CI] = [0.17, 0.73]), we found the expected 3-way interaction, such that the scenario significantly moderated the interactive effect ideology and the fear manipulation had on this willingness (B </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Understanding the effects of fear in political contexts is of major theoretical importance. The literature on fear has for years demonstrated its potency in affecting withdrawal tendencies from frightening situations, but has rarely addressed various factors that may moderate fear's impact-among them long-standing ideological beliefs and unique contextual attributes. Similarly, the literature on ideology has contributed to our understanding of interpersonal differences in fear reactivity, but has not clearly examined how such differences may be related to differing outcomes in the face of fear. In this study, we endeavored to examine the interactive influence of ideology and fear on one extreme form of withdrawal intention: physically leaving one's country. To settle the seemingly-contradictory predictions stemming from the literature, we hypothesized that context would moderate the outcomes of this interaction. Specifically, in ideologically-irrelevant contexts, fear would have a greater impact on rightists' (versus leftists') willingness to consider flight because of their greater behavioral reactivity to fear-inducing experiences. In ideologically-relevant contexts characterized by a focal intergroup conflict, however, rightist ideology provides clear guidelines for an appropriate reaction, and therefore rightists (versus leftists) would be less moved by their fear to consider flight.</p><p>To examine this hypothesis, we manipulated both fear levels and the type of context. We found that ideology moderated the effect of fear on flight intentions in two very different ways, depending on the fearinducing context. Inducing fear of an approaching epidemic (an ideologically-irrelevant threat) among Jewish Israelis led to increased willingness to consider flight only among rightists, but inducing fear of a Palestinian uprising (an ideologically-relevant threat from an adversarial outgroup) among this population led to increased willingness to consider flight only among leftists. The findings thus provided support for our hypothesis that context shapes the interactive influence of fear and ideology on flight intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>These findings may contribute to our understanding of how behavior intentions are shaped by two very important constructs-ideology and emotions-thus contributing to both relevant bodies of literature. First, they illuminate differences stemming from political ideology, providing greater insight into right-left differences in affective processes. Specifically, by placing the spotlight on fear's outcomes, this study indicates that rightists and leftists may differ not only in their reactivity to fear-inducing stimuli, but also in their readiness to act in fear's wake. In doing so, we extend our recent findings <ref type="bibr" coords="5,192.92,413.50,74.58,7.54" target="#b38">(Pliskin et al., 2014)</ref> that the impact of various emotions, including fear, on policy support is moderated by ideology. In the present examination, we learn that this is true for behavior intentions as well, but we also learn that the direction of this interactive effect is context-dependent, with the context's relation to ideological beliefs playing a crucial role. Consequently, these findings join previous work arguing that contextual factors must be taken into account when considering ideological differences in psychological reactions to threatening or otherwise negative situations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,52.78,507.66,68.35,7.54" target="#b9">Choma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,123.08,507.66,72.10,7.54" target="#b12">Federico et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>This study also contributes to our understanding of fear and other emotions, as it challenges the common notion that emotions always lead to the behavioral intentions associated with them (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,261.01,539.01,23.70,7.54;5,33.73,549.50,40.87,7.54" target="#b32">Lerner et al., 2003)</ref>. We identified at least two factors that may determine to what extent emotions lead to action tendencies: long-term individual factors such as ideology, and external factors such as context. These both play an undeniable role in shaping the end result of emotional processes-with certain orientations more conducive to behavioral outcomes than others under different circumstances (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,243.84,601.77,40.96,7.54;5,33.73,612.26,43.50,7.54" target="#b20">Halperin &amp; Pliskin, 2015</ref>, for a full discussion of the importance of acknowledging context when studying emotional processes).</p><p>These findings also shed new light on the specific role of fear in political contexts. Thus far, fear has usually been examined for its role in increasing or decreasing support for conciliatory <ref type="bibr" coords="5,222.57,654.10,62.21,7.54" target="#b19">(Halperin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,33.73,664.54,66.79,7.54" target="#b32">Lerner et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,102.67,664.54,158.82,7.54" target="#b44">Sabucedo, Duran, Alzate, &amp; Rodríguez, 2011)</ref> or aggressive (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,82.83,675.02,50.92,7.54" target="#b3">Bar-Tal, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,136.01,675.02,67.55,7.54" target="#b48">Skitka et al., 2006)</ref> policies, or for its role in motivating simple everyday personal actions <ref type="bibr" coords="5,209.19,685.46,71.63,7.54" target="#b24">(Huddy et al., 2002)</ref>. Nonetheless, physical departure might also be a relevant means of safeguarding oneself in the face of threatening situations, albeit an extreme and costly one. We find in these studies that even in contexts characterized by high identification and attachment, and in which the social costs of physical escape are particularly high, fear may increase people's willingness to consider leaving their country. Such an understanding may be important to the wider understanding of psychological processes underlying human migration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p>The findings of the present research reveal the importance of acknowledging different types of context, but they fall short of empirically illuminating the process by which the varying ideological weight of the context influences the outcomes of rightists' and leftists' emotions. The findings were in accordance with our hypotheses, and thus point to a potential role for rightist ideology as a coping mechanism in the face of certain ideologically-relevant fears-a role that is absent in the face of ideologically-irrelevant fears. Nonetheless, there may be other explanations for the difference between the two scenarios, such as the presence or absence of a target for blame attribution, differences in the contexts' relation to varying moral foundations (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,490.91,230.43,61.83,7.54;5,301.72,240.86,45.95,7.54" target="#b16">Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009)</ref>, differences in appraisals of the threat and/or challenge posed by the situation (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,397.31,251.35,96.25,7.54" target="#b5">Blascovich &amp; Mendes, 2000)</ref>, and differences stemming from varying perceptions of control. An empirical examination of the processes involved in these differences is necessary to gain a fuller understanding of the role of context, ideology, and emotion in affecting individual action tendencies. Because threat was a central element in our manipulation, future research focusing on ideological differences in the relationship between different types of threat and flight intentions may be especially valuable.</p><p>An additional central limitation of the present research is its conceptual focus on the right edge of the ideological spectrum, providing rightfocused hypotheses while acknowledging the left strictly for comparative purposes. This stems from a similar focus on rightists in much of the relevant psychological literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,461.26,376.87,63.79,7.54" target="#b29">Jost et al., 2003a)</ref>, but it creates a gap in our understanding of ideology as (at-least) a bidirectional construct. Indeed, our finding that fear of an ideologicallyirrelevant threat increased rightists' but not leftists' willingness to consider flight was partially perplexing because of this reduced theoretical focus on the psychology of leftist ideology, indicating another process may be at play in leftists' reactions to fear. In line with recent empirical examinations focusing on the left end of the spectrum <ref type="bibr" coords="5,301.72,460.55,193.78,7.54" target="#b8">(Choma, Hafer, Dywan, Segalowitz, &amp; Busseri, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,498.33,460.55,54.44,7.54;5,301.72,471.03,85.98,7.54" target="#b51">van der Toorn, Napier, &amp; Dovidio, 2014)</ref>, further research is required to illuminate the psychological processes motivating ideological leftists.</p><p>Finally, while it reveals substantial differences between two different fear-inducing contexts, the two contexts employed can only begin to cover the wide range or real-world types of fear-inducing situations. Other fear-inducing situations exist that may be related or unrelated to ideology and intergroup conflict in different ways. The many possible differences in situational features indicate great potential for added knowledge in examining other types of fear-inducing contexts in the future.</p><p>In summary, the present research sheds light on several phenomena important for the understanding of social and political processes related to migration. First, it examines an action tendency of great political significance-migration in the face of threat. Second, it places fear, a highly influential emotion, in context, examining how fear induced by different types of threat may lead to different outcomes for different people. Finally, it acknowledges and sheds light on the role of ideology as a moderating factor for the outcomes of emotional processes, showing that its function, like that of fear, is highly context-dependent.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,374.17,402.89,178.53,7.97;3,301.72,413.44,251.03,7.54;3,301.72,423.93,251.05,7.54;3,301.72,434.36,250.96,7.54;3,301.72,444.73,251.07,7.97;3,301.72,455.16,251.05,7.97;3,301.72,465.77,251.03,7.54;3,301.72,476.26,251.05,7.54;3,301.72,486.69,251.11,7.54;3,301.72,497.18,251.04,7.54;3,301.72,507.61,251.07,7.54;3,301.72,518.10,251.04,7.54;3,301.72,528.53,251.04,7.54;3,301.72,539.02,251.07,7.54;3,301.72,549.45,90.98,7.54"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>SE = .18, t = 7.55, p b .0001, [CI] = [1, 1.72], as we had intended.

To disentangle this interaction, we first looked at the conditional effect of the ideology × fear-manipulation interaction at the two values of the scenario moderator.

In the ideologically-irrelevant scenario, the manipulation affected willingness to consider flight only among those one standard deviation below the mean of ideology, hereafter termed rightists (B = 1.04, SE = .32, t = 3.3, p = .001, [CI] = [0.42, 1.66]), surprisingly having no influence over those one standard deviation above the mean, hereafter termed leftists (B = .04, SE = .31, t = .15, p = .88, [CI] = [− 0.56, 0.65]). In the ideologically-relevant scenario, however, the manipulation had no significant effect on rightists (B = −.04, SE = .26, t = − .14, p = .89, [CI] = [− 0.56, 0.48]), but it significantly increased willingness to consider flight among leftists (B = .78, SE = .27, t =2.84, p = .005, [CI] = [0.24, 1.32).
