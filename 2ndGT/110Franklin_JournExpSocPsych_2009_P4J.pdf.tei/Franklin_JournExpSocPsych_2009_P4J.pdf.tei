Additionally, faces, like other stimuli, have an aesthetic value that exists independent of sexual reward. Aharon et al. assert that some variation in what is attractive may be unrelated to activation in reward regions of the brain. However, this assertion has not been tested empirically. The aim of the current study was to examine behavioral evidence for the existence of these two forms of attractiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Female attractiveness preferences</head><p>To date, indirect evidence exists for a dual-process in attractiveness judgments. Women's attractiveness preferences appear to shift as a function of individual differences, situational context, and culture. Although sexually-dimorphic feminine features are consistently preferred by male raters <ref type="bibr" coords="1,463.30,616.16,85.45,7.53" target="#b18">(Perrett et al., 1998)</ref>, evidence for a similar preference in female raters remains inconclusive. Women often rely on nonsexual cues such as self-resemblance and femininity in assessing male attractiveness, except under some specific conditions.</p><p>Female perceptions of attractiveness shift across the menstrual cycle, from preferences for masculine features during the most fertile phase (follicular phase) to feminine features during the least fertile part (luteal phase; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,389.66,699.85,94.48,7.53" target="#b17">Penton-Voak et al., 1999)</ref>. Explanations for shifts in mate preference imply that masculinity in male faces represents a better short-term mate while femininity represents a better long-term mate <ref type="bibr" coords="2,131.01,67.96,162.59,7.53;2,42.52,78.39,19.84,7.53" target="#b13">(Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, &amp; Perrett, 2002)</ref>. Attractiveness is also more rewarding in the follicular phase <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,88.88,78.58,7.53" target="#b5">(Dreher et al., 2007)</ref>. Likewise, self-resembling faces, which are more aesthetically pleasing but less sexually desirable, are preferred in the luteal phase <ref type="bibr" coords="2,113.10,109.80,61.68,7.53" target="#b3">(DeBruine, 2005)</ref>. This suggests that masculinity in male faces is related to how rewarding a face is while femininity is related to aesthetic preferences. Additionally, in cultures that place less value on paternal investment and more value on genetic fitness, preferences for masculinity increase <ref type="bibr" coords="2,240.15,151.64,53.42,7.53;2,42.52,162.08,97.51,7.53" target="#b16">(Penton-Voak, Jacobson, &amp; Trivers, 2004)</ref>. Although these studies do not claim a dual-processing account, these effects can be explained by one.</p><p>To firmly establish that two separate and dissociable routes of attractiveness exist, we must first show that both sexual and nonsexual preferences are present in attractiveness judgments and that these can be dissociated by experimental manipulation. To do this, we manipulated the relative holistic versus feature-based processing of faces. Holistic processing is necessary for the perception of facial averageness, because prototype preference utilizes the spatial relationship between features <ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.41,256.25,100.80,7.53" target="#b23">(Winkielman et al., 2006)</ref>. Since averageness is aesthetically pleasing in both faces and objects <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,277.17,114.39,7.53" target="#b9">(Halberstadt &amp; Rhodes, 2003)</ref>, we hypothesized that disrupting holistic processing would undermine aesthetic (i.e., nonsexual) face preference judgments. To test this, we used a variation of the composite face paradigm (Le <ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.42,308.59,156.16,7.53" target="#b12">Grand, Mondloch, Maurer, &amp; Brent, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,319.02,118.69,7.53" target="#b24">Young, Hellawell, &amp; Hay, 1987)</ref>. The split-face paradigm disrupts holistic-based processing while enhancing feature-based processing in identity judgments (Le <ref type="bibr" coords="2,154.20,339.94,67.58,7.53" target="#b12">Grand et al., 2004)</ref>. Therefore, attractiveness judgments of split-faces should rely more on features, which represent sexually-dimorphic information, thereby enhancing sexual face preference judgments. Thus, from a dual-route framework, we hypothesized that split-half faces should change the pattern of processing for mate-relevant stimuli by disrupting holistic processing that is critical to aesthetic preference while enhancing sexual preference derived from masculine features. Therefore, in split-faces we predict that sexual value in mate-relevant faces will be enhanced in judgments of attractiveness, whereas for all other conditions we predict that aesthetic value will be larger.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Heterosexual female undergraduate participants (N = 100) completed the study. Fifty participants completed a face pre-rating phase and 50 the experimental phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>Twenty-five male and 25 female color faces of Caucasian subjects were used <ref type="bibr" coords="2,106.35,590.83,113.93,7.53" target="#b14">(Martinez &amp; Benavente, 1998)</ref>. Stimuli consisted of the face and neck of subjects facing forward with neutral expressions. Stimuli were 768 Ã‚ 576 pixels at a resolution of 72 dots per inch. Split-face manipulations were based on Le <ref type="bibr" coords="2,244.34,622.18,49.22,7.53;2,42.51,632.67,23.06,7.53" target="#b12">Grand et al. (2004)</ref>. For the split-face condition, an ovoid region of the face area was cropped and resized to a size of 320 Ã‚ 240 pixels, roughly the same size as the face itself in the other stimuli. To create splitfaces, each stimulus was bisected horizontally and the bottom was deviated 25% to the right in half of the stimuli and to the left in the other half (see <ref type="figure" coords="2,125.22,684.95,18.88,7.53" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and procedure</head><p>Pre-rating phase Fifty participants were randomly assigned to rate faces using a modified version of situational ratings utilized by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,248.63,747.77,44.90,7.53;2,311.51,325.97,22.94,7.53" target="#b13">Little et al. (2002)</ref>, in order to generate ratings within a hypothetical sexual or nonsexual social context. For the sexual situation, participants were asked to ''rate these faces on their appeal as a hypothetical date." In the nonsexual situation, participants were asked to ''rate the following faces on their appeal as a hypothetical lab partner." Both ratings used 7-point scales with 1 = very low appeal to 7 = very high appeal. 1 Faces were randomly presented. These sexual and nonsexual ratings were then used to examine the differences in perceived attractiveness from whole-faces versus split-faces as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental phase</head><p>Fifty participants were randomly assigned to rate whole-and split-faces on facial attractiveness. In this phase no social contextual information was offered as we were interested in the influence of holistic versus feature-based processing on strategies used to determine attractiveness judgments. Participants were simply asked to ''rate these faces on how attractive they are" where 1 = very low attractiveness to 7 = very high attractiveness. Whole versus split-facial images were used to manipulate holistic versus feature-based processing, respectively. Correlations were then computed between each participant's ratings of general attractiveness for the whole-and split-face images with the mean of the preratings of these same faces within the sexual and nonsexual contexts, enabling us to examine the influence of holistic versus feature-based processing on perceived sexual versus nonsexual value. Faces were randomly presented.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-rating phase</head><p>The sexual and nonsexual conditions showed high interrater reliability (a = .91 and a = .85, respectively).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental phase</head><p>Ratings for whole and split-faces also yielded high interrater reliabilities (a = .92 and a = .90, respectively).</p><p>In order to isolate unique variance associated with sexual and nonsexual judgments as a function of our experimental manipulation, partial correlations were used to assess the relative contribution of sexual versus nonsexual judgments to general attractiveness ratings of whole-faces versus split-faces. Correlations were assessed separately for male and female faces in order to examine our predicted mate-relevance effects. These correlations were used as the basis of the ANOVA reported below.</p><p>Participant ratings from the experimental phase of the study were correlated with both the mean of the sexual and nonsexual pre-ratings while controlling for the other pre-rating (i.e., sexual controlling for nonsexual and vice versa). These correlations were then transformed to Fisher-z scores to normalize them and were subsequently used as our dependent variable of interest (see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,264.70,245.82,19.08,7.53;3,32.71,256.25,72.76,7.53" target="#b10">Judd, Ryan, &amp; Park, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>We hypothesized that general attractiveness ratings in the experimental phase of the study would be more highly correlated with nonsexual than sexual face preferences, except for split-face attractiveness ratings for mate-relevant faces (i.e., other-sex), which we hypothesized would be more highly correlated with sexual than nonsexual face preferences, thereby revealing relatively heightened mate-relevant preference as a function of the split-face manipulation. Thus, we predicted a three-way interaction. To test this, we computed an items analysis using a 2(face condition: whole-face versus split-face) by 2(rating context: sexual versus nonsexual) by 2(face gender: male versus female) mixed-design ANOVA, with context and face condition as within-subject variables, and face gender serving as a between-subject variable.</p><p>This 192, SE = .010) than split-faces (M = .106, SE = .010). As predicted, these effects were not qualified by an interaction, (F(1, 24) &lt; 1).</p><p>However, for male faces neither main effect was significant (Fs &lt; 1), but the predicted interaction was, F(1, 48) = 6.00, p &lt; .02, g 2 p Â¼ :111 . Male split-faces show the opposite pattern from whole-faces with sexual correlation being higher than nonsexual, t(48) = Ã€1.97, p &lt; .05 (one-tailed). Further, in male faces, the splitrelative to whole-face condition significantly reduced the correlation of nonsexual face preference, t(48) = 3.01, p &lt; .005 (onetailed), while increasing the correlation of sexual face preference, t(48) = Ã€1.88, p &lt; .05 (one-tailed). Although some of these effects reach only marginal two-tailed significance, the pattern of effects is clear and in the predicted direction. The significant interaction and absence of main effects for male faces highlights a pattern of diminished aesthetic and increased sexual judgments for split-face relative to whole-faces (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,140.09,747.89,18.88,7.53" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p>Previous work indicates that individual and situational differences can give rise to differences in what facial qualities women report finding attractive. The current work suggests this may be due to a dual-process in perceived attraction. Here we were able to generate shifts in the predominant strategy women used, sexual versus nonsexual, using a split-face manipulation, disrupting holistic processing while leaving sexually-dimorphic features in a face intact. There was a main effect of manipulation, where whole-faces were higher correlated than split-faces. This is likely because sexual and nonsexual pre-ratings were on whole-faces themselves and thus more similar to the whole-face condition. More importantly, the split-face manipulation shifted women's attractiveness judgments from a predominantly nonsexual strategy to a predominantly sexual one, but only for mate-relevant faces. This is consistent with the conclusion that disrupting holistic processing yields greater reliance on sexual-based judgments for women. More importantly, this work demonstrates that women assessed attraction based on both sexually-relevant appearance cues and nonsexual, aesthetic qualities in a face. The reversal for the split-face mate-relevant faces is the critical finding, however, revealing that these processing strategies can be decoupled, strongly supporting the conclusion that facial attraction is driven by a dual-process.</p><p>Women appear to generally rely more heavily on nonsexual aesthetic qualities of a face when making attractiveness judgments of both men and women. In the current study it was only when holistic processing was disrupted and feature-based processing enhanced by splitting mate-relevant faces that women relied more heavily on a sexual strategy. This supports research widely reported on women's attractiveness judgments, but begs the question of why this is the case, particularly as men consistently rely on sexual judgments in mate-relevant faces. Although our findings only indirectly address this question, it is nonetheless worth discussion. Evolutionary models argue for innately prepared sex-differences in mate selection <ref type="bibr" coords="3,410.38,434.92,46.42,7.53" target="#b2">(Buss, 1988)</ref>. However, our findings support a cultural explanation as well.</p><p>Women are arguably culturally attuned to look for nonsexual attractiveness in same-and other-sex faces and may inhibit reward-based sexual judgments (see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,435.46,476.76,93.54,7.53" target="#b16">Penton-Voak et al., 2004)</ref>. Supporting this, in female faces we found aesthetic judgments remained predominant even when holistic processing was disrupted. However, in male faces disrupting holistic processing decreased aesthetic judgments and increased the salience of sexual judgments. Interfering with holistic processing also caused a significant reduction in correlations involving both sexual and nonsexual judgments of female faces which implies that women rely on holistic processing. Thus, it may be that culturally internalized beauty standards are relied upon by women to assess sexual face preference in both men and women, assuming holistic processing is not disrupted <ref type="bibr" coords="4,103.52,151.64,109.34,7.53" target="#b7">(Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997)</ref>. From this view, women appear to default to a more sexual strategy when judging attraction in male faces only when holistic face processing is disrupted, a finding consistent with other observations that sex-differences disappear under conditions of increased processing load (e.g., DeSteno, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,98.48,203.92,140.20,7.53" target="#b4">Bartlett, Braverman, &amp; Salovey, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies to date have shown that men use shifting strategies in their attractiveness judgments, which is why our examination focused on women's preferences. However, given that men appear more attuned to sexual value in mate selection than women <ref type="bibr" coords="4,92.92,256.25,103.91,7.53" target="#b8">(Gangestad &amp; Scheyd, 2005)</ref>, our findings may be extended to predict that enhancing holistic and/or disrupting feature-based processing in men might yield a reversal in male preferences as well.</p><p>In sum, the current work supports a dual-process model of facial attractiveness. Such a dual-process implies that sexual and nonsexual routes reflect different meanings, with different adaptive origins and neurological underpinnings.
