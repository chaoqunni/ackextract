<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>This research studied possible benefits of indoor plants on attention capacity in a controlled laboratory experiment. Participants were 34 students randomly assigned to one of two conditions: an office setting with four indoor plants, both flowering and foliage, or the same setting without plants. Attention capacity was assessed three times, i.e. immediately after entering the laboratory, after performing a demanding cognitive task, and after a five-minute break. Attention capacity was measured using a reading span test, a dual processing task known to tap the central executive function of attention. Participants in the plant condition improved their performance from time one to two, whereas this was not the case in the no-plant condition. Neither group improved performance from time two to three. The results are discussed in the context of Attention Restoration Theory and alternative explanations.</p></div>

Directed attention is seen as having finite capacity, one that can be depleted after cognitively demanding tasks that cause mental fatigue.

Instead, it triggers undirected attention, enabling the directed attention system to rest.

The second aim of the study was therefore to test possible effects on performance of having plants present during a 'five-minute', i.e. a relatively short break between attention demanding tasks, where the participants had to stay in the office during the break. We expect that the participants would pay more attention to the surrounding during a break compared to the working session, and that the presence of plants during a break may trigger undirected attention.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Design</head><p>An experimental study was conducted with two independent variables. The between-subjects variable was the presence or absence of plants, while attention capacity was measured three times as a within-subjects variable. Attention capacity was tested immediately after entering the room to obtain a baseline level (T1), after a fifteen-minute proofreading task (T2), and after a fiveminute break (T3). The proofreading task was introduced to cause further attention fatigue and to provide a measure of the effect of having plants present during a working session. The participants were separated by gender, then randomly assigned to the two between-subject groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Participants</head><p>A total of 34 students from a university in Norway participated in the study. Participants were recruited through announcements in classes, on the students' internal web page and by direct communication. They were informed that it was a study of attention in work related situations, and that they would be given some tasks to solve on a computer. No information about the environmental factor was mentioned. The data collection occurred between November 2008 and March 2009. Twenty-two participants were women with an average age of 25.0 (SD ¼ 5.8), with thirteen participants in the intervention (plant) group and nine in the control (no-plant) group, and twelve participants were men, with an average age of 23.3 (SD ¼ 3.9), five in the intervention group and seven in the control group. Participants were native Norwegians, and were rewarded by participating in a drawing of two gift tokens at the local bookstore being worth NOK 500 (ca. 85 USD) each.</p></div>

The participants were presented with sequential sentences on the computer screen in trials of four or six, and instructed to read the sentences aloud as well as to remember the last word in each sentence. Each completion of the RST contained a total of 96 sentences, i.e. twelve trials of four sentences followed by eight trials of six sentences. After each trial, the participants wrote down the last word from each sentence in a given space on an answer sheet, the spaces being numbered according to trial and sentence. The participants were instructed to recall the target words in the same order as presented.</p><p>Sentence presentation was programmed with Superlab (produced by Cedrus, San Pedro, CA, USA) and run on a Microsoft Windows platform. The sentences were printed in lower case letters, displayed on a Targa 21" screen in approximately 10 mm tall Helvetica, black on a grey background, providing high legibility.</p><p>Presentation time for each sentence was 2000 ms with no interstimulus interval between the sentences in the same trial. After each trial, the prompt 'Write down the words. Press green button when you want to continue' was presented and remained on the screen until the green button on the RB 830 Response Box (produced by Cedrus) was pressed. The next trial started after an interval of 1000 ms.</p><p>All sentences were in the form: subject e verb e object. All subjects and objects were frequently used nouns that were easy to visualize (see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,100.06,317.83,126.12,7.54" target="#b44">Paivio, Yuille, &amp; Madigan, 1968)</ref>. Three different versions of the stimulus material comprising the 96 sentences were constructed. No words were repeated or used as both subject and object in the same version, and all sentences were unique throughout the three versions. The sequence of the three stimulus material versions was random and different for each participant, allocated to the three presentation times referred to as the withinsubject variable. The sequence of the presentation of the sentences in each trail of four and six sentences was randomized in each presentation.

The room was on the second floor of an early 20th century university building, and had a large window facing towards northeast that did not allow direct sunlight into the room. It was equipped with standard office lighting. The room was painted in light grey (Natural Colour System: S 0500-N) and had white curtains that were drawn back. The view from the window was towards deciduous trees, other buildings, and a large lawn. The study took place during winter, when there were no leaves on the trees. The room contained a wooden desk with the monitor, and a small wooden shelf. The walls were unadorned, except for binders on the shelf. In order to initiate the proofreading task and the second (T2) and third (T3) reading span tasks without further breaks or interruptions the experimenter was present in the room throughout the session. She was sitting in the background behind the shelf, not facing the participant (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,311.51,346.95,19.28,7.54" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The experimenter was occupied with reading when she was not initiating the tasks.</p><p>The following plants were used in the intervention: two flowering pink colored plants of Phalaenopsis, each with two flowering stems, placed in white pots on the window sill, one Aglaonema commutatum in a white pot, approximately 30 cm tall, standing on the desk, and one tree-shaped Schefflera arboricola, approximately 120 cm tall in an anthracite-colored pot, standing on the floor between the desk and the shelf (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,451.12,430.57,92.48,7.54" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1, panel B and Fig. 2)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Procedure</head><p>The participants were tested individually, and the total procedure lasted approximately 60 min. Participants were first instructed by the experimenter about the procedure. They were also instructed to turn off mobile phones and music players and not to eat or exit the room during the session. An informed consent was signed, stating they could withdraw from the experiment at any time. Instructions for the RST were then presented on the monitor. Three practice trials of four sentences were presented to familiarize the participants with the experimental procedure. After finishing the 12 four sentence trials, a short instruction was presented on the screen informing participants that the next trials were based on six sentences. They were given one practice trial of six sentences, before they were presented the 8 six sentence trials.</p><p>Participants performed the RST three times, each lasting approximately 10 min; at the beginning of the session, after a 15 min proofreading task, and after a five-minute pause. When participants finished the first test, a short instruction was given by the experimenter about the proofreading task, and participants were then given 15 min to work on the task. After finishing the RST the second time, they were informed that they could have a fiveminute break, the purpose of which was to rest in order to perform well on the final test. After the final attention test, they were presented with a short questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Data analysis</head><p>Words interpreted as correct, but spelled incorrectly, were coded as correct. Dependent variables were the percentage of correctly memorized words recalled in any order, and recalled in the same order as presented. The percentage of words recalled was first calculated for the four and six sentence trials separately. Then a mean score was calculated for all trials. The scores ranged from 0 to 100%. In order to test whether there were effects of plants during work paired sample t-tests comparing the performance at T1 and T2 were reported for the plant and the no-plant group. To examine effects of plants during a break between demanding tasks, paired sample t-tests comparing the performance at T2 and T3 were reported for the plant group and the no-plant group. To ascertain whether performance for the two groups was similar at the baseline level, an independent sample t-test comparing the plant and the noplant group at T1 was reported. In order to examine whether performance was better in the plant group relative to the no-plant group at T2 and T3, independent sample t-tests were run to compare the level of performance. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was used to assess the effects of plants, measuring time point and the interactions for the intervals T1eT2 and T2eT3. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 17.</p></div>

Attention capacity was measured consecutively three times with RSTs, the first measure being used as a baseline. Then an intended to be fatiguing task was introduced before attention capacity was measured a second time. After a fiveminute break, attention capacity was measured a final time. The research examines whether the presence of plants during a working session, and/or during a break between demanding tasks, led to improved performance relative to a no-plant condition.</p><p>No difference between the plant and the no-plant groups at time T1 indicates that there were no pre-experimental differences between the groups and that T1 did indeed function as a baseline.</p><p>Improved performance during work from T1 to T2 was observed in the plant group but not in the no-plant group. This finding was true when attention capacity was measured as number of correctly memorized words in the same order as presented, or in any order. The findings were contrary to the hypothesis that a main effect of fatigue from T1 to T2 should have occurred. The proofreading task may not have been demanding enough to cause attention fatigue.</p><p>Although detecting syntactic errors is found to involve central executive functions of attention, errors more complex than commas and page breaks may be more demanding to detect <ref type="bibr" coords="5,311.53,98.12,102.21,7.54" target="#b35">(Larigauderie et al., 1998)</ref>. Two different processes may have operated between T1 and T2: a practice effect in both the plant and the no-plant condition and a fatiguing effect that was larger in the no-plant condition. Thus, it is possible that improvement due to practice in the no-plant condition was canceled out by the decrease in performance due to fatigue. In the plant condition, however, the improvement due to practice was not canceled out by a fatiguing effect, supporting assertions of ART that indoor plants can have a restorative effect on cognitive performance. In the ART framework, if attention restoration can occur during 'micro restorative' experiences like looking at natural elements while working as suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,362.95,213.22,51.14,7.54" target="#b24">Kaplan (1993)</ref>, the lack of fatigue found for the plant condition may have been caused by small lapses of attention or mind wandering <ref type="bibr" coords="5,375.42,234.14,134.47,7.54" target="#b53">(Smallwood, Nind, &amp; O'Connor, 2009</ref>) that helps to restore directed attention. Short interval switches of directed and undirected attention is supported by neuropsychological studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,329.68,265.50,112.48,7.54" target="#b51">Shiffrin, Diller, &amp; Cohen, 1996)</ref>. In addition, the positive effect of presence of plants on cognitive performance during a work session is also supported by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,426.34,286.47,68.66,7.54" target="#b39">Lohr et al. (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="5,516.70,286.47,45.89,7.54;5,311.53,296.91,49.97,7.54" target="#b48">Shibata and Suzuki (2001</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,387.79,296.91,25.84,7.54" target="#b8">, 2004</ref>. As also reported by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,311.53,307.39,79.84,7.54">Suzuki (2002, 2004)</ref>, the present study confirms that central executive functions can be restored by environmental factors. The divergence between the present findings and the lack of plant effects reported by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,390.79,338.75,43.94,7.54" target="#b47">Rich (2007)</ref>, who also used a task tapping central executive function, can be explained by the repeated measure design used in the present study and the strengthening of the statistical power.</p><p>In the present experiment the no-plant condition was an unusually barren environment. It is possible that the effect of plants would have been different if the plant intervention was compared to a more visually rich office. Further, the observed effects of the plants could also be ascribed to the visual distraction from the presence of the researcher during the work, and not by the plants as such. On the other hand, both groups had window view to nature and thus had the opportunity to draw the attention away from the researcher. However, the possible restorative effects of looking out the window did not seem to outrange the restorative effects of the indoor plants.</p><p>In the present study, attention capacity did not improve from T2 to T3 for either the plant or the no-plant group, this was true when attention capacity was measured as number of correctly memorized words in the same order as presented, or in any order. Therefore, the present study does not support the hypothesis that plants will improve attention capacity when present during a defined fiveminute break. ART is based on the tenet that directing attention on a task causes fatigue, and that attention capacity can be restored by a shift to undirected attention triggered by a fascinating environment. If a defined break between demanding tasks is necessary for undirected attention to be triggered, the present results fail to confirm such a phenomenon. However, there may be several reasons for the failure of attention restoration to occur during the break inserted between attention demanding tasks in the present study. Because the proofreading task used in the present study was obviously not very fatiguing, it may be that the students at T2 are performing their best and that a break cannot improve their performance. Other explanations for the lack of improved performance after the break may be that the plant environment was not fascinating enough to cause attention restoration, or the break may need to be longer than 5 min to elicit the onset of undirected attention. The presence of the experimenter throughout the session, although occupied with reading, may have been stressful and reduced the participants' experience of having a break. An alternative model to ART could also explain why performance was better for the plant group during work.

Thus, the difference found in performance between the two groups may have been caused by a buffering or stress-reducing effect of the indoor plants.</p><p>The present study confirms that natural elements can affect cognitive performance in an office work environment. However, the processes of how the presence of the plants affects cognitive performance cannot fully be answered by the present study. The results can be understood in the context of ART, as well as an environment-arousal model of cognitive performance. More research is recommended to examine what and how the work environment affects cognitive processes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,311.53,288.59,250.99,6.03;3,311.53,297.15,28.09,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Room arrangement for the no-plant condition (panel A) and the plant condition (panel B).</figDesc></figure>
