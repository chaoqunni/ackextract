<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study tests a central theoretical assumption of stress process and job strain models, namely that increases in employees' control and support at work should promote well-being. To do so, we use a group-randomized field trial with longitudinal data from 867 information technology (IT) workers to investigate the well-being effects of STAR, an organizational intervention designed to promote greater employee control over work time and greater supervisor support for workers' personal lives. We also offer a unique analysis of an unexpected field effecta company merger-among workers surveyed earlier versus later in the study period, before or after the merger announcement. We find few STAR effects for the latter group, but over 12 months, STAR reduced burnout, perceived stress, and psychological distress, and increased job satisfaction, for the early survey group. STAR effects are partially mediated by increases in schedule control and declines in family-to-work conflict and burnout (an outcome and mediator) by six months. Moderating effects show that STAR benefits women in reducing psychological distress and perceived stress, and increases non-supervisory employees' job satisfaction. This study demonstrates, with a rigorous design, that organizational-level initiatives can promote employee well-being.</p><p>What is missing in the job strain literature are the health and well-being effects of employees' control over work time and supervisors' support of family and personal lives. The job strain model focuses on employees' control over how they perform their work, but many employees are stressed because they do not</p></div>

A second thread is the considerable interdisciplinary scholarship on the job strain theoretical model, where high strain is the result of high demands combined with low control and low support <ref type="bibr" coords="2,101.23,631.16,97.66,8.78" target="#b39">(Johnson and Hall 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,201.26,631.16,32.76,8.78;2,51.49,643.16,22.78,8.78" target="#b43">Karasek 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,139.59,643.16,90.10,8.78">Theorell 1990, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Third, fundamental cause theory is used to explain the ongoing relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health/wellbeing outcomes over time <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.12,103.32,71.40,8.78;2,252.00,115.32,22.78,8.78" target="#b60">(Link and Phelan 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,279.05,115.32,71.42,8.78" target="#b61">Link et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,354.74,115.32,79.75,8.78" target="#b90">Phelan et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.00,127.32,146.48,8.78" target="#b91">Phelan, Link, and Tehranifar 2010)</ref>.

We control for location in the status hierarchy by sampling workers in one industry (information technology) and one organization (a Fortune 500 firm). This professional sample was a deliberate choice because we were seeking employees in a demanding work environment but without a raft of other stressors associated with low income that might override any work initiative we could design. In other words, this sample allows us to investigate the effects of changes in the work environment among workers who face high work demands, but who are unlikely to face additional neighborhood and family stressors tied to poverty and financial struggles that would not be addressed by this intervention.</p></div>

For contemporary workers, role strain is often implicitly or explicitly about time (e.g., gaps between the time needed for occupational and family demands, and how to schedule and arrange work and family tasks so multiple responsibilities can be met) (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="3,70.33,367.32,109.32,8.78" target="#b14">Clawson and Gerstel 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,182.39,367.32,51.62,8.78;3,51.48,379.32,52.15,8.78" target="#b23">Fenwick and Tausig 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,106.48,379.32,101.31,8.78" target="#b38">Jacobs and Gerson 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,210.64,379.32,23.33,8.78;3,51.48,391.32,22.78,8.78" target="#b75">Moen 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,76.84,391.32,157.16,8.78;3,51.48,403.32,21.53,8.78" target="#b100">Schieman, Whitestone, and Van Gundy 2006)</ref>. This was the rationale for the development of our intervention aimed at providing workers with more control over their time and training supervisors to recognize the conflicting work and home pressures workers face. Note that we are examining workers' control over their work time, not reductions in work time such as part-time hours. Research shows that people with more ability to manage their time and more support from their supervisors report greater well-being. The challenge is to devise and test whether an organizational change giving workers greater control over their time and more supervisor support improves their well-being.</p></div>

These research designs raise issues of selection, because different types of workers choose or are allocated to particular job environments that provide more or less control and more or less support.

We are thus testing the stress process approach and a variant of the job strain model (looking at time control rather than job control) in a deliberate experiment, not simply comparing people in different circumstances. Specifically, we investigate within-person change in well-being over time in light of changes in their work-related resources. We do so through a rigorous field trial design, randomizing work teams to "STAR" (treatment) and "usual practice" (control) groups.

STAR aims to (1) increase employees' control over their work hours and schedules and (2) increase employee perceptions of supervisor support for employees' work and family/personal lives. STAR's third goal, tied to research on the organizational rewards associated with "face time" and long hours, is to reorient the work culture toward results, rather than hours at the workplace .

We analyze STAR's impact on subjective well-being outcomes to begin investigating whether and how these workplace changes affect employees' health. Specifically, we identify the effects of STAR on changes in four measures of well-being over a 12-month period: burnout, job satisfaction, perceived stress, and psychological distress. Such subjective well-being measures are important in terms of intrinsic life quality, but they are also related to other health outcomes and have the potential to decrease stress-related symptoms and illnesses over a longer period of time <ref type="bibr" coords="5,343.21,319.32,91.32,8.78" target="#b72">(Melamed et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,252.00,331.32,83.70,8.78" target="#b106">Stansfeld et al. 2002)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HyPOTHESES</head><p>Taken together, the job strain and stress process approaches lead us to theorize that deliberate organizational changes targeting employees' control over their work time and the support they receive should produce corresponding changes in employees' subjective well-being. Unlike worksite health promotion interventions that target stress or well-being directly as a private individual trouble (e.g., yoga classes or mindfulness training [see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,51.49,115.32,76.48,8.78" target="#b34">Hartfiel et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,129.98,115.32,68.94,8.78" target="#b41">Kabat-Zinn 2003]</ref>), STAR aims to change the rules of the game at work (including the policies, practices, interactions, and expectations that structure employees' lives on the job) and affect how work and personal life can be managed effectively and with less strain. STAR facilitates new practices, such as increased options to work at home and flexibility to shift one's schedule, but also emphasizes that employees have control over when, where, and how they do their work and that managers and co-workers support their efforts to address family and personal responsibilities . Stress process theory suggests that this work redesign intervention may increase energy resources and decrease exposure to stresses by giving employees control to "fit" the pieces of their lives together more easily and feel supported in those efforts, thereby improving subjective well-being. Similarly, the job strain model suggests that increasing employees' control over where and when they do their work and providing greater support for family and personal life will enhance well-being.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Employees randomized to the STAR initiative will experience positive changes in indicators of well-being (an increase in job satisfaction and decreases in burnout, perceived stress, and psychological distress) compared to employees working under usual practices (control group).</p><p>We also investigate possible mediators of the relationship between STAR and subjective well-being to help identify mechanisms through which workplace interventions may benefit employees. We theorize a mediated model in that we anticipate STAR will have direct effects in enhancing workers' subjective well-being, but will also operate in part through five theorized mechanisms: increasing workers' sense of schedule control, increasing workers' sense that their supervisors are supportive, reducing workers' workfamily conflict, encouraging workers to shift their schedules and work more at home, and reducing workers' feelings of burnout. We treat burnout-specifically emotional exhaustion-as an outcome, because it is an important measure of psychological health, but we also investigate whether changes in burnout by six months mediate the effects of STAR on the other well-being outcomes.</p><p>Increasing workers' schedule control and sense of having a supportive supervisor are key goals of the STAR intervention and have been shown to change in the expected directions by the six-month follow-up .

STAR involved eight hours of participatory training sessions that encouraged teams and managers to identify new work practices and processes that would increase employees' control over their work time and focus on key results (rather than simply face time at work). For example, there were extensive discussions concerning communicating by instant messenger, coordinating more efficiently with offshore staff, and better anticipating and handling periods of high demands, such as around software releases. Additionally, training activities proposed that being "always on"-quickly responsive via e-mail, instant messenger, or in person-did not necessarily mean workers were productive or efficient in accomplishing the most important tasks. Teams varied in the changes they implemented regarding work processes and coordination, but all workers randomized to the STAR initiative experienced considerable flexibility as to where and when they worked, including the ability to work at home without requiring a supervisor's permission. Previously, work at home was sometimes allowed with managerial approval, but such a case-by-case "accommodation" does not shift control to employees <ref type="bibr" coords="7,409.06,415.32,25.43,8.78;7,252.00,427.32,124.67,8.78" target="#b79">Moen, Kelly, Tranby, and Huang 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The STAR intervention also involved supervisor training to encourage supervisor support for family/personal life and professional development; this involved four hours of additional training sessions as well as customized computer-based training for managers that included a video message from a senior executive endorsing STAR.

In this case, a merger was announced during our data collection, while STAR training was occurring for some groups randomized to the intervention.

Mergers and restructuring are part and parcel of corporate life, but few studies examine organizational interventions in the context of other ongoing organizational changes that may involve new roles, relocation, or job loss.

The timing of the baseline survey and the introduction of the STAR intervention in relation to the exogenous shock of the merger announcement adds complexity to the study, but it also enables us to assess whether an increase in resources (supervisor support and schedule control) prior to an exogenous stressor (merger announcement) operates differently than introduction of an intervention following such an exogenous shock. We expect the Early Survey Group (who experienced STAR before learning about the merger) may have been more open to this work redesign and thus better positioned to benefit from it. This group is the focus of our analysis.</p><p>Although implementation of STAR was identical for the Early and Late Survey Groups, the ways employees interpreted the intervention may not be the same. Workers undergoing the baseline survey and STAR training after the merger announcement (Late Survey Group) may not have taken the STAR intervention seriously, given the uncertainties and dislocations fueled by this announcement. Indeed, observations of STAR training sessions occurring after the merger announcement revealed that employees routinely and explicitly questioned whether STAR would "survive" the merger and whether it fit with the emerging culture of the combined firm. Moreover, the Late Survey Group's baseline responses already reflect the effects of knowing about the merger, leading to some differences from the baseline responses of the Early Survey Group (see <ref type="bibr" coords="8,270.14,583.32,62.90,8.78" target="#b57">Lam et al. 2015)</ref>.

Well-being outcomes were measured at Wave 3, 12 months after baseline. We regressed these outcomes on their lagged measures at baseline and condition (STAR or control).

Condition 1 is established in <ref type="table" coords="11,62.71,283.32,29.10,8.78" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, and Condition 2 is established in <ref type="table" coords="11,51.48,295.32,30.86,8.78">Table 1</ref> (based on t-tests, but results remain even with mixed-effects models adjusting for covariates).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics</head><p>We find no differences in baseline wellbeing outcomes among respondents in the Early Survey Group (Panel A); but as hypothesized, by Wave 3 the Early Survey respondents in STAR had significantly lower levels of burnout ( p &lt; .001), perceived stress ( p &lt; .05), and psychological distress ( p &lt; .05), as well as noticeably higher job satisfaction ( p &lt; .01). This provides initial support for Hypothesis 1. By contrast, the Late Survey Group (Panel B) showed no difference in well-being outcomes at Wave 3 by STAR condition.</p><p>We calculated changes in perceptions of schedule control and family supportive supervisor behavior, reductions in family-to-work conflict and burnout, and increased adoption of variable schedules and working from home as the first step in testing potential mediators between STAR and changes in well-being outcomes by 12 months. Previous research demonstrates that over a six-month period, STAR improved employees' sense of schedule control and family supportive supervisor behaviors, while reducing family-to-work conflict , findings replicated in <ref type="table" coords="11,390.13,594.49,29.69,8.78">Table 1</ref>  . Family-to-work conflict decreased by .04 for respondents randomized to STAR, whereas it increased by .07 for the control group ( p &lt; .05). About one in four STAR respondents reported their schedules changed from "not variable" to "variable," compared with 12 percent in the control group ( p &lt; .001). Over the six months, STAR respondents increased their time working at home by 7.6 hours a week, significantly higher than the two-hour increase among control respondents ( p &lt; .001). Finally, we observe a reduction in burnout over six months for STAR respondents but not for the control group (-.26 versus .08, p &lt; .01). These findings lay the groundwork for testing their effects as mediators between STAR and changes in wellbeing. Also note that, except for perceived and actual schedule flexibility, respondents in the Late Survey Group did not experience the desirable changes brought about by the STAR intervention (Panel B).</p></div>

We present the outcomes in this order because the first two are distinctively job-related, whereas the latter capture general states of subjective well-being. Results from the multilevel analysis show that by Wave 3, STAR respondents in the Early Survey Group (not exposed to merger announcement when randomized to STAR) experienced significantly reduced emotional exhaustion/burnout (-.534, p &lt; .001) and increased job satisfaction (.208, p &lt; .01), as well as lower perceived stress (-.478, p &lt; .05) and psychological distress (-.570, p &lt; .05) than similarly situated respondents in the control group. We further calculated effect sizes by dividing STAR coefficients (from <ref type="table" coords="13,51.49,628.59,28.96,8.78" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>) by the standard deviation of the outcome at baseline. STAR effects are mostly small (.2) to moderate (.5) as judged by <ref type="bibr" coords="13,252.00,67.75,62.12,8.78" target="#b15">Cohen's (1988)</ref> rule of thumb, but in general are higher for burnout (.36) and job satisfaction (.27) than for perceived stress (.18) and psychological distress (.18). By contrast, for respondents in the Late Survey Group (taking baseline survey after merger announcement), STAR had no well-being effects. This suggests STAR benefited the subjective wellbeing of workers who were not worried about the merger at the time they began or received the STAR training. Given the null STAR effects for the Late Survey Group, we conducted all subsequent analyses on the Early Survey Group. As a sensitivity check, we also conducted analyses for the full sample (see <ref type="table" coords="13,387.55,247.75,35.90,8.78" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref> in the online supplement). For this combined sample, we find that STAR significantly decreased burnout (-.289, p &lt; .01) and increased job satisfaction (.160, p &lt; .01) by Wave 3. These effects are maintained even after controlling for the effect of being in the Early or Late Survey Group. Given that the Late Survey Group's baseline responses are confounded by their prior exposure to the stress of the merger, results from the Early Survey Group represent the most valid tests of STAR's effects on well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Analysis of STAR on Subjective Well-Being</head><p>To more precisely assess how STAR improves subjective well-being in the Early Survey Group, we examine specific mechanisms theorized to account for the relationship between the organizational intervention and well-being: increasing schedule control and family supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB), decreasing family-to-work conflict and burnout, and increasing schedule flexibility and working at home.</p><p>We use two methods to test mediation, Baron and Kenny's approach (Sections 1 of <ref type="table" coords="13,252.00,592.59,29.19,8.78" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>) and a modified Sobel's test, tailored for multilevel models with bootstrapped standard errors (Sections 2 of <ref type="table" coords="13,353.91,616.59,28.62,8.78" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>).

Note: Early Survey Group refers to respondents who did not know about the merger until after their baseline survey. All models control for lagged dependent variables at baseline, manager status, gender, and age cohort. Results for covariates are available upon request. Multilevel mediation analysis was done using the ml_mediation program in Stata, which was developed based on <ref type="bibr" coords="19,266.00,395.84,7.58,19.10;19,266.00,379.84,7.58,13.78;19,266.00,334.51,7.58,43.10;19,266.00,306.94,6.49,25.34" target="#b56">Krull and MacKinnon (2001)</ref>. We obtained indirect effects by bootstrapping the ml_mediation command with 1,000 replications with a seed value of 1. Coefficients under sections 1 and 2 are not directly comparable. Those under section 1 (Baron and Kenny's approach) denote how the outcome changes with a one-unit increase in the mediator. Take the mediator of burnout for job satisfaction (Panel B) as an example, -.077 means a one-unit increase in burnout decreases job satisfaction by .077. Coefficients under section 2 (Sobel's test with bootstrapped standard errors) represent the product of two values: STAR's effect on the mediator and the mediator's effect on the outcome, so the signs could differ from corresponding coefficients in section 1 depending on how STAR affects the mediator. Again use the mediator of burnout for job satisfaction (Panel B) as an example, .027 has a positive sign because STAR decreases the mediator, burnout, and because burnout decreases job satisfaction. The product of these two negative values therefore is positive, .027, which means the mediation effect of reduced burnout on the STAR-job satisfaction relationship is .027. * p &lt; .05; ** p &lt; .01; *** p &lt; .001 (two-tailed). <ref type="table" coords="19,55.80,625.20,8.52,22.68;19,55.80,615.19,4.26,7.51" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(continued)</head><p>most of its STAR effects mediated (Panel D). Baron and Kenny's approach suggests a full mediation by three mediators (schedule control, family-to-work conflict, and burnout). Similarly, the modified Sobel's tests show that these three indirect paths are all statistically significant, each accounting for over 20 percent of the total STAR effect on psychological distress. Second, perceived stress is the only outcome with little mediation (Panel C), suggesting STAR has a direct, rather than indirect, effect on employees' stress. Third, changes in schedule control (from baseline to six months) are a strong mediator, accounting for 17 percent of the STAR effect in increasing job satisfaction, 23 percent of the STAR effect in decreasing psychological distress, and 19 percent of the STAR effect in decreasing burnout between baseline and Wave 3. Changes in family-to-work conflict also mediate the relationship, but not as strongly; 8 percent and 24 percent of the STAR effects on decreased burnout and decreased psychological distress, respectively, are mediated by reductions in family-to-work conflict. We also considered burnout itself as a possible mediator, finding that changes in burnout account for 13 percent of the STAR effect on increased job satisfaction and 23 percent of the STAR effect on decreased psychological distress. Fourth, of the six mediators, FSSB and the two flexibility practice measures (schedule changes and working at home) seem to be the weakest; none of the mediation effects are defined as statistically significant according to the modified Sobel test. Taken as a whole, Hypothesis 2 is partially supported in that some (but not all) of the STAR effects on wellbeing outcomes occur through STAR's effects in increasing workers' schedule control and reducing their levels of family-to-work conflict and burnout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderation Analysis of STAR Effects on Subjective Well-Being</head><p>The stress process theoretical model emphasizes the importance of status locations as potential moderators of relationships between the social environment and well-being <ref type="bibr" coords="20,403.21,67.32,31.31,8.78;20,252.00,79.32,21.73,8.78" target="#b87">(Pearlin 1999)</ref>. Accordingly, we examine whether STAR effects differ among various subgroups of respondents, again focusing on the Early Survey Group. To do so, we analyze the interaction of STAR and four potential moderators: gender, gendered parental status, age-cohort, and managerial status. We find no statistically significant difference between STAR and the usual practice groups in subjective well-being outcomes by age-cohort, suggesting that STAR promoted well-being across various age groups of workers.</p><p>However, we find that STAR reduced psychological distress more for women than for men. To facilitate understanding of this moderating effect, we present a figure showing models with significant interaction terms. In <ref type="figure" coords="20,395.22,271.32,35.44,8.78">Figure 1a</ref>, women randomized to STAR have significantly lower levels of psychological distress by Wave 3 than women in the control group. No such difference is found for men (gender interaction, p &lt; .05). We also see a gender interaction for perceived stress, although it is only marginally significant ( p &lt; .06, see <ref type="figure" coords="20,351.21,355.32,35.97,8.78">Figure 1b</ref>). Note that both men and women benefit from STAR in the two well-being measures most closely tied to work, with similar declines in burnout and increases in job satisfaction regardless of gender. The gender component of Hypothesis 3 is thus only partially supported. <ref type="figure" coords="20,264.00,439.32,39.07,8.78">Figure 2a</ref> further examines gender differences by presenting predicted psychological distress at Wave 3 for four subgroups: women with children at home, women without children at home, men with children at home, and men without children at home. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workers engaged in active parenting (especially mothers) will benefit most from STAR; the STAR effect seems to be largest among women without children at home ( p &lt; .05). <ref type="figure" coords="20,324.56,559.32,39.52,8.78">Figure 2b</ref> shows means of psychological distress at Wave 1 and Wave 3 for women with and without children at home and by STAR. We see that mothers and women without children at home randomized to STAR reported comparable declines in psychological distress over 12 months (the two solid lines). Women without children in the control group, by contrast, experienced increased psychological distress over this period (black dashed line), which appears to be the main reason why we find a particularly large STAR effect for women without children at home. In further analysis, we find women without children at home were older (average age of 50 versus 44 to 48 for the other groups), much more likely to be single (41 percent versus 3 to 23 percent), and more apt to have adult care responsibilities (31 percent versus 20 to 25 percent). We speculate that the increased distress of women in the control group may reflect the challenges and vulnerabilities of older women in highly demanding jobs with less control over their time, but this is the case for only one well-being measure; analyses of the three other outcomes found no differences in effects of STAR by gender/active parenting status.</p><p>We hypothesized that managers would benefit less than employees in terms of improved subjective well-being, which is partially supported for job satisfaction. <ref type="figure" coords="21,400.23,517.26,34.26,8.78" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref> shows that employees (but not managers) randomized to STAR had higher levels of job satisfaction than their peers in the usual practice groups ( p &lt; .05).</p></div>

Although the potential for change in social environments is an explicit component of stress process and job strain theories, most research involves cross-sectional correlational studies or, to a lesser extent, longitudinal studies of events, such as job loss or caregiving, to examine potential declines in well-being. We demonstrate, with a rigorous randomized field trial, that changes in work conditions arising from an organizational intervention (providing workers with greater control over the time and timing of their work, and encouraging supervisor support for family and personal life) produce corresponding salutary changes over a 12-month period in four components of subjective wellbeing: burnout, job satisfaction, perceived stress, and psychological distress. <ref type="bibr" coords="23,63.48,335.88,95.66,8.78" target="#b11">Bronfenbrenner (2005)</ref> makes the claim that to really understand something, one should try to change it-and yet few scholars have studied deliberate efforts to improve subjective well-being by modifying the social environments of work. By contrast, major strides have been made in removing or protecting workers against toxic physical environments, even though too many disadvantaged workers still face hazards today. There has been a real lag in recognizing the toxicity of social environments, including the ways work is constrained by rigid work-time rules and unsupportive supervisors. Some employers offer individuallevel stress reduction techniques, suggesting methods to cope with difficulties rather than promoting well-being by improving the work environment. This is understandable, given the time and financial costs of developing and testing a theoretically grounded intervention that is acceptable to organizational stakeholders while simultaneously substantial enough to make a difference in workers' lives.</p><p>Our study does just that. It also confirms there are inevitable complexities with even "clean" research designs such as field experiments. One major complexity of our study was the sudden announcement of a corporate merger in the midst of data collection. This event allowed us to examine how work conditions are affected by both deliberate organizational initiatives and the challenging, changing social context. In retrospect, we now see the IT world as a turbulent environment full of mergers, acquisitions, and constant change. Fortunately, given the study timeline, we were able to parse out intervention effects on the Early Survey Group (who were not exposed to the merger shock before exposure to STAR) from the Late Survey Group.</p><p>We found pronounced salutary effects of the intervention only for the Early Survey Group. One important implication of our findings is that workers (like those in the Late Survey Group) already faced with major organizational dislocations (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, or dramatic rounds of downsizing) are unlikely to buy into and benefit from more positive organizational interventions. Other research has also found that workplace interventions have null effects (and, in some cases, negative impacts) on health and wellbeing when organizational restructuring and downsizing are also occurring <ref type="bibr" coords="23,384.02,611.88,50.46,8.78;23,251.99,623.88,17.22,8.78" target="#b20">(Egan et al. 2007</ref>). There was no significant downsizing in the study period we report on here, but we nevertheless find no STAR effects on The uncertainty of the upcoming merger offset-and perhaps overwhelmed-any potential benefits of STAR for workers facing the impending organizational changes.</p><p>The positive effects of this organizational intervention on the Early Survey Group raise additional questions relevant to stress process and job strain theoretical models. In particular, how does STAR influence subjective wellbeing? We find evidence of three partial mediators for different components of well-being: increases in respondents' sense of schedule control, reductions in their family-to-work conflict, and reductions in burnout. But much of STAR's effects remain unexplained by these mediators, suggesting the need for greater attention to the "how" of organizational innovations like STAR and, indeed, for continued attention to the mechanisms underlying inequality in health and well-being, as well as in other resources <ref type="bibr" coords="24,155.53,319.32,54.78,8.78" target="#b93">(Reskin 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Another important question raised by both stress process and job strain models is whether this type of workplace intervention benefits particular sets of workers more than others. We theorized that workers potentially vulnerable to stress at work, at home, and due to the juxtaposition of the two would be most apt to see improvements in subjective well-being. We find no moderators of burnout; in other words, STAR reduced workers' burnout regardless of their gender, their parenting circumstances, their age-cohort, or whether they were managers or non-supervisory employees. Similarly, STAR improved the job satisfaction of all these subgroups with only one exception: employees were more apt than managers randomized to STAR to experience an increase in job satisfaction. The broad effects of STAR across subgroups likely reflect that these outcomes are more explicitly tied to work than the more global measures of perceived stress and psychological distress.</p><p>Our findings that STAR reduced psychological distress and perceived stress more for women is consistent with our expectation that more vulnerable workers would benefit more from these changes. Women's well-being is clearly affected by work roles and resources as well as normative family caregiving responsibilities <ref type="bibr" coords="24,317.45,91.32,55.86,8.78" target="#b103">(Simon 2014)</ref>, and the link between work-family strains and well-being is clearer for mothers than for fathers <ref type="bibr" coords="24,403.41,115.32,25.92,8.78;24,252.00,127.32,135.77,8.78" target="#b84">(Nomaguchi, Milkie, and Bianchi 2005)</ref>. However, the increase in psychological distress among women without children in the control group suggests that vulnerability extends beyond simply caring for young children. Future research needs to consider the stresses of employed older women who are more apt to be single and caring for parents or other adults, in particular. Our findings suggest that women without children at home may be distressed due to their high workloads (including paid work and caregiving) and lower likelihood of having a spouse to share home tasks, caregiving, and breadwinning, and that organizational changes, like STAR, can improve their well-being.</p><p>Mothers benefit from these organizational changes too. Mothers in STAR reported significantly more time adequacy with their family , and mothers in STAR increased their time with adolescent children over a one-year period, whereas mothers in the control group decreased their time with children . There is also evidence that STAR "crossed over" from parents' experiences to positively affect adolescents' well-being, as measured in greater positive affect and less negative reactivity to daily stressors for children who had a parent in STAR, compared to children whose parent was in the usual practice group <ref type="bibr" coords="24,377.86,487.32,56.67,8.78;24,252.00,499.32,51.02,8.78">(Lawson et al. forthcoming)</ref>. Adolescents with a parent in STAR also reported less variation in sleep duration from night to night, less time to fall asleep, and better sleep quality, although no difference was found in sleep duration . While research on mothers, fathers, and children is certainly important, it should be balanced by research on the growing number of older women workers to fully understand the nexus of work, family, and health.</p><p>What are the implications for studying workers' mental health and for devising organizational policies and practices to reduce risk factors? First, drawing on stress process and job strain approaches, we provide clear evidence that specific conditions matter for well-being and can be changed. This necessitates more than "helping" workers muddle through their stressful lives by teaching them individual coping strategies. Instead, this study demonstrates the value of an organizational initiative promoting greater flexibility and control for workers as well as greater supervisor support. Moreover, organizational changes that lower workers' burnout, perceived stress, and psychological distress bring benefits to employers as well, because such outcomes are apt to reduce productivity and increase absenteeism, presenteeism (i.e., showing up, but not being engaged at work), turnover, health problems, and poor life quality at work and at home.</p><p>Second, we show that organizational interventions can promote facets of subjective well-being partly because they increase control and reduce family-to-work conflict and burnout, but there are also other unidentified mechanisms that need to be investigated. Moreover, different mechanisms may operate for people in working-class or other nonprofessional or less technical jobs. For example, employees represented by unions may appreciate this type of intervention (if pursued with the union's support) because it increases their voice outside of the formal bargaining context and legitimates addressing work-life concerns as well as wages and benefits in negotiations and on the job <ref type="bibr" coords="25,161.56,475.32,68.11,8.78" target="#b5">(Berg et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Third, interventions targeting all workers, not just those most at risk, seem to have broad impacts and reach beyond the most vulnerable subgroups of workers. But IT workers are all less "at risk" than workers with less education, skills, and professional status; future studies need to test similar interventions and specify mechanisms in different workforce populations. A real limitation, though a deliberate one, of this study is the focus on IT workers who have demanding, stressful jobs but who are not simultaneously incomestrapped. Researchers seeking to develop and test interventions advancing subjective well-being should move beyond IT workers to consider the service sector, blue-collar jobs, and other white-collar work environments and how economic hardship may moderate any intervention effects.</p><p>Fourth, issues of sustainability are important. We were unable to test for sustainability given subsequent dislocations in the merging organization after the 12-month survey. This is a key topic for future research.</p><p>Finally, this study demonstrates the value of real-world, randomized field trial research designs for teasing out causal relationships and processes, despite the costs and complexities they invariably engender. If randomized field trials are not feasible, natural experimental designs studying the effects of policy, economic, or other changes happening "on the ground" but not deliberately implemented by researchers are another way of capturing and studying change.</p><p>Social scientists are now equipped with the methodological tools, and more often able to collect the necessary longitudinal data, to better inform both theory and policy decisionmaking related to the social determinants of physical and mental health as well as other resources. Scholars should begin to recognize and strive to improve the quality of intervention and organizational research to showcase the structural forces and changes that can impede or promote workers' well-being.</p><p>Family Researchers Network, and the Population Association of America meetings for their comments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notes</head><p>1. We found one study in which nursing units were randomly assigned to self-managed scheduling or the control condition <ref type="bibr" coords="26,137.31,430.33,96.70,7.02;26,69.49,440.33,17.41,7.02" target="#b92">(Pryce, Albertsen, and Nielsen 2006)</ref>; this design is closest to our group-randomized trial. <ref type="bibr" coords="26,104.77,450.33,95.47,7.02">Pryce and colleagues (2006)</ref> found no significant effects of self-scheduling on nurses' health and well-being, although the intervention improved work-life balance and job satisfaction. 2. A corporate merger is always highly confidential because it significantly affects a firm's stock price. Our contacts in TOMO had a sense the company was not doing well, but neither HR managers, managers, nor employees had specific clues about a forthcoming merger announcement. 3. Within the Early Survey Group, 76 percent of the STAR sample had completed the STAR training before the merger was announced. The remainder of the Early Survey Group randomized to STAR had completed the baseline survey and had begun the STAR training sessions, or their upper management had introduced STAR, before the merger was announced. In supplemental analyses, we found that this latter group-who learned of the merger during the STAR training period, rather than after it was completed-did not differ significantly from others in the Early Survey Group in age, cohort membership, gender, managerial status, baseline well-being outcomes, or baseline job demands (psychological job demands and work hours). Given these similarities and given our rationale in distinguishing early versus late respondents (i.e., whether their baseline well-being measures were contaminated by the merger announcement), we report the simpler comparison of early compared to later respondents. 4. Workers were eligible to participate in the study if they were employees (not contractors) or managers located in the two cities where data collection occurred. One study group, whose employees were represented by collective bargaining agreements, was excluded because of concerns that the intervention might conflict with some contractual work rules; union leadership was consulted on the decision and suggested that course of action. 5. We excluded 15 employees who were randomized to the STAR intervention but were not invited to participate in STAR because of a staff error. We also excluded eight employees initially randomized to the control group, because they were shifted to new teams already going through STAR. 6. If a respondent skipped a specific item but completed at least 75 percent of the scale (e.g., 3 out of 4 items for perceived stress), we assigned the mean from that respondent's responses to other questions in that scale. If respondents did not complete at least 75 percent of the scale, they were omitted from that model.</p></div>
