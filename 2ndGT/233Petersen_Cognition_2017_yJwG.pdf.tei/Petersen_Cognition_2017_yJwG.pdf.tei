<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>Phasic alertness refers to a short-lived change in the preparatory state of the cognitive system following an alerting signal. In the present study, we examined the effect of phasic auditory alerting on distinct perceptual processes, unconfounded by motor components. We combined an alerting/no-alerting design with a pure accuracy-based single-letter recognition task. Computational modeling based on Bundesen's Theory of Visual Attention was used to examine the effect of phasic alertness on visual processing speed and threshold of conscious perception. Results show that phasic auditory alertness affects visual perception by increasing the visual processing speed and lowering the threshold of conscious perception (Experiment 1). By manipulating the intensity of the alerting cue, we further observed a positive relationship between alerting intensity and processing speed, which was not seen for the threshold of conscious perception (Experiment 2). This was replicated in a third experiment, in which pupil size was measured as a physiological marker of alertness. Results revealed that the increase in processing speed was accompanied by an increase in pupil size, substantiating the link between alertness and processing speed (Experiment 3). The implications of these results are discussed in relation to a newly developed mathematical model of the relationship between levels of alertness and the speed with which humans process visual information.</p></div>

The ability to prepare and sustain alertness is an important attentional function, which, if impaired, can result in severe attentional problems. A broad distinction is made between tonic and phasic alertness <ref type="bibr" coords="1,257.32,538.45,36.27,7.53;1,42.52,548.94,57.25,7.53" target="#b47">(Sturm &amp; Willmes, 2001)</ref>: Tonic (intrinsic) alertness denotes the sustained long-term intensity level of attention, whereas phasic (extrinsic) alertness refers to a short-lived increase of attention elicited, for example, by a warning signal preceding an upcoming event. Phasic alertness has been found to reduce reaction times in response to various stimuli <ref type="bibr" coords="1,104.43,601.21,189.16,7.53" target="#b12">(Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, &amp; Posner, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,42.52,611.70,83.87,7.53" target="#b38">Posner &amp; Boies, 1971)</ref>, which was originally attributed to faster preparation and/or execution of the motor response <ref type="bibr" coords="1,263.27,622.13,30.33,7.53;1,42.52,632.62,21.99,7.53" target="#b37">(Posner, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,66.50,632.62,53.39,7.53" target="#b43">Sanders, 1980)</ref>. Evidence, however, is accumulating showing that phasic alertness also affects earlier perceptual processes. For instance, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,77.73,653.54,79.95,7.53" target="#b28">Matthias et al. (2010)</ref> presented a visual alerting cue prior to a whole report letter display <ref type="bibr" coords="1,165.37,663.97,60.64,7.53" target="#b45">(Sperling, 1960)</ref> and used mathematical modeling based on the Theory of Visual Attention (TVA; <ref type="bibr" coords="1,311.53,475.69,65.06,7.53" target="#b7">Bundesen, 1990)</ref> to show that phasic visual alerting increased visual processing speed and changed the spatial distribution of attentional resources. These findings are particularly interesting because they were obtained using pure accuracy-based measures, unconfounded by motor components. Phasic auditory alertness has also been reported to affect early perception <ref type="bibr" coords="1,534.15,528.02,28.45,7.53;1,311.53,538.45,186.77,7.53" target="#b19">(Jepma, Wagenmakers, Band, &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,505.98,538.45,56.60,7.53;1,311.53,548.94,128.19,7.53" target="#b23">Kusnir, Chica, Mitsumasu, &amp; Bartolomeo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,443.33,548.94,119.24,7.53;1,311.53,559.37,57.98,7.53" target="#b42">Robertson, Mattingley, Rorden, &amp; Driver, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,371.85,559.37,95.00,7.53" target="#b52">Weinbach &amp; Henik, 2011)</ref>. However, most of these studies rely on reaction time-based measures, by which it is difficult to disentangle effects on early perception from effects on later, response-based processes (although see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,482.17,590.77,80.40,7.53" target="#b13">Finke et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,311.53,601.21,84.82,7.53" target="#b42">Robertson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,398.61,601.21,85.65,7.53" target="#b6">and Brown et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, in this article we use pure accuracy-based measures and TVA-based modeling to examine how phasic auditory alertness influences early visual perception. In contrast to most previous research on phasic alerting, we do not rely on uniform foreperiod distributions (i.e., distributions of the time interval between the cue and the target) because such distributions confound the alerting effect with the build-up of temporal expectancy as time elapses <ref type="bibr" coords="1,457.68,674.45,100.90,7.53" target="#b53">(Weinbach &amp; Henik, 2012)</ref>. Instead, we use a non-aging foreperiod distribution <ref type="bibr" coords="1,526.05,684.88,36.50,7.53;1,311.53,695.37,64.94,7.53" target="#b32">(Niemi &amp; Näätänen, 1981)</ref> to reduce the effect of temporal expectancy (but see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,344.75,705.80,89.75,7.53" target="#b25">Lawrence &amp; Klein, 2013</ref> for a more sophisticated, yet less simple, approach). A non-aging distribution has a constant hazard rate (i.e., a constant probability that the target appears during the next little period of time, given that the target has not yet appeared), resulting in a distribution with many short and only a few long foreperiods. Experiment 1 was a single-letter recognition task in which a high-intensity alerting cue (85 dB) was presented prior to a backward-masked target letter in 1/3 of the trials, and TVA-estimates of visual processing speed and perceptual threshold were compared between the alerting and no-alerting conditions. In Experiment 2, we investigated the effect of alerting intensity on TVA-estimates by including both high (85 dB) and low (40 dB) intensity cues in an experimental design similar to the design used in Experiment 1. Finally, in Experiment 3 we replicated Experiment 2 but included measures of pupil size to examine physiological effects of auditory alerting (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,188.79,214.39,69.49,7.53" target="#b21">Kahneman, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,263.51,214.39,20.28,7.53;2,32.71,224.88,146.66,7.53" target="#b49">Tona, Murphy, Brown, &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Based on previous findings by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,174.90,235.31,88.42,7.53" target="#b28">Matthias et al. (2010)</ref>, we hypothesized that presentation of an auditory alerting cue, similar to the presentation of a visual alerting cue, increases visual processing speed. Further, theoretical considerations by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,245.14,266.72,38.68,7.53;2,32.71,277.15,123.89,7.53" target="#b9">Bundesen, Vangkilde, and Habekost (2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.92,277.15,57.75,7.53">see discussion)</ref> suggest that the intensity of alerting should correlate with the observed estimates of processing speed. It has previously been reported that increasing levels of auditory alerting prior to an imperative stimulus lead to faster response times <ref type="bibr" coords="2,207.61,318.99,46.28,7.53" target="#b22">Keuss, 1972)</ref>, but to the best of our knowledge this is the first time effects of alerting intensity on early perceptual processes have been investigated using pure accuracy-based measures, unconfounded by motor processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theory of Visual Attention</head><p>The behavioral data in this article were analyzed by use of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.71,419.05,69.27,7.53" target="#b7">Bundesen's (1990)</ref> Theory of Visual Attention (TVA). In this section, we introduce TVA and the way it was used to analyze data from the single-letter recognition task. In general, TVA proposes that an object x in the visual field is encoded into visual short-term memory (VSTM) by encoding one or more categorizations of the object into VSTM. A categorization has the form ''object x belongs to category i" (or equivalently ''object x has feature i"), where i is a perceptual category (e.g., a certain letter shape, color, size, or orientation). Consider the hazard rate, vðx; iÞ, of the event that the categorization ''x belongs to i" becomes encoded into VSTM at a given time t. If f ðtÞ and FðtÞ are the probability density and distribution functions of the event, the hazard rate is f ðtÞ=½1 À FðtÞ, which is a measure of the speed of processing at time t. By the rate equation of TVA,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,32.71,571.51,251.07,29.34">vðx; iÞ ¼ gðx; iÞb i w x X z2S w z ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where gðx; iÞ is the strength of the sensory evidence that object x belongs to category i, b i is the perceptual bias associated with category i, and w x is the attentional weight of object x, which is divided by the sum of attentional weights across all objects in the visual field, S. When several objects are presented simultaneously in the visual field, they compete for access to the limited storage space of VSTM. Objects that are likely to win the competition are those that differ from their local surroundings (feature contrast) and those that are relevant for the task (feature relevance). Such objects get high attentional weights (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.27,706.03,123.46,7.53;2,32.71,716.52,19.58,7.53" target="#b34">Nordfang, Dyrholm, &amp; Bundesen, 2012)</ref>, and task-relevant categorizations of objects with high attentional weights are likely to become encoded into VSTM (see Eq. (1)).</p><p>As an example, consider the task of reporting the identity of red letters (targets) among equally salient blue letters (distractors).</p><p>According to TVA, the visual system solves this task by setting the attentional weights high for red objects and low for blue objects. This makes categorizations of red objects faster than categorizations of blue objects. Furthermore, to facilitate that only task-relevant categorizations of letter shapes are encoded into VSTM, the perceptual biases associated with letter shapes (i.e., b A ; b B ; . . . ; b Z Þ are set high, whereas perceptual biases for taskirrelevant categories are set at values near zero.</p><p>TVA is a general model of visual perception (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,514.15,151.64,38.68,7.53;2,301.72,162.07,21.90,7.53" target="#b7">Bundesen, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.00,162.07,164.24,7.53" target="#b8">Bundesen, Habekost, &amp; Kyllingsbaek, 2005)</ref>. In this article, we use TVA to model data from a simple, single-letter recognition task, which greatly reduces the complexity of the model. If we neglect the storage limitation of VSTM and neglect potential perceptual confusions by setting gðx; iÞ ¼ 0 for all incorrect categorizations of object x, the probability of encoding object x into VSTM can be expressed as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,303.08,233.83,249.66,29.86">p ¼ 1 À e ÀvxðsÀt 0 Þ s &gt; t 0 0 s 6 t 0 ( ;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where v x is the processing speed of object x (i.e., the speed of the process of correctly categorizing object x), s is the exposure duration of object x, and t 0 is the longest ineffective exposure duration (a.k.a. the threshold of perception). That is, if the exposure duration of an object is shorter than or equal to t 0 , the probability of encoding the object into VSTM is zero. However, if the exposure duration of the object is longer than t 0 , the probability of encoding the object into VSTM increases exponentially as a function of s À t 0 . An instance of the model (corrected for guessing, see method section of Experiment 1) is provided in <ref type="figure" coords="2,424.97,367.58,20.64,7.53">Fig. 2</ref> with t 0 interpreted visually as the exposure duration at which the curve rises from pure guessing performance and v as the slope of the curve at t 0 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiment 1</head><p>To investigate the effect of phasic auditory alerting on visual perception we conducted an experiment in which participants were to report the identity of a post-masked letter presented for varying exposure durations. This made it possible to perform a TVA-based modeling of the data for each individual subject. In one third of the trials, a loud 85 dB auditory alerting cue preceded the presentation of the letter. In the remaining two thirds of the trials, the letter was presented without a preceding cue. The TVA-based modeling of the data was performed independently for the two conditions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Participants</head><p>28 Danish students (23 females, 5 males, mean age = 22.8 years, SD = 1.8 years) were paid a standard fee by the hour (18 students) or received course credits (10 students) for participating in the experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and performed within the normal hearing range on a screening audiometer test (Oscilla Ò USB-310). The study was approved by the departmental board of ethics (No. 2012/2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Design</head><p>In one third of the trials, an 85 dB auditory cue was played prior to the presentation of a target letter (85 dB cue condition), whereas in the remaining two thirds of the trials no auditory cue was given (no cue condition; see <ref type="figure" coords="2,386.93,706.03,18.43,7.53">Fig. 1</ref>). This distribution of trials was chosen to allow for longer periods with low alertness while leaving enough trials in the cue condition for TVA-based modeling. To avoid habituation to a specific auditory stimulus, the cue was played equally often at either a high pitch of 900 Hz or at a low pitch of 500 Hz. Target letters were chosen randomly without replacement from a set of 20 letters (ABDEFGHJKLMNOPRSTVXZ), such that each letter was presented once and only once for each exposure duration in the cue condition and twice for each exposure duration in the no cue condition. Exposure durations were chosen from a set of eight durations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,152.67,684.66,140.93,7.53">(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 ms)</ref> such that each exposure duration was used equally often in both conditions. This 20 Â 8 factorial design resulted in one session of the experiment comprising 160 cue trials and 320 no cue trials. To reduce dynamics related to temporal expectancy, the intertrial interval (ITI) and cue-target onset asynchrony (CTOA) were drawn from distributions with constant hazard rates (nonaging distribu-tions; cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,346.11,365.93,43.06,7.53" target="#b27">Luce, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,391.29,365.93,62.07,7.53" target="#b31">Näätänen, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,455.52,365.93,53.67,7.53" target="#b48">Thomas, 1967)</ref>. More specifically, the ITIs were distributed geometrically using time-steps of 200 ms and a hazard rate of 1/3 (i.e., the probability that the cue would appear at the next possible time point given that it had not yet appeared). This resulted in a distribution with many short and only a few long ITIs ranging from 1600 to 4000 ms and with an expected ITI of 2000 ms. Accordingly, the CTOAs were distributed geometrically using time-steps of 30 ms and a hazard rate of 2/5 resulting in CTOAs ranging from 200 to 470 ms and an expected CTOA of 244 ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Procedure</head><p>Stimuli were presented on a 21" CRT monitor running at 100 Hz using E-prime 2 software in a semidarkened room with participants seated approximately 65 cm from the monitor with their heads supported by a chinrest to ensure constant viewing distance and position throughout the experiment. During the ITIs, a black fixation cross (0.44°Â 0.44°of visual angle, 0.39 cd/m 2 ) was presented centrally on a grey background (17.5 cd/m 2 ) and participants were instructed to keep fixation on the cross throughout the presentation of the cross. In the cue condition, a trial was initiated by a 200 ms, 85 dB cue played by two loud speakers located next to the monitor. The presentation of the cue was followed by a varying CTOA during which the fixation cross was still presented, thus in the no cue condition the effective ITI was ITI + CTOA. A trial proceeded with the presentation of a target letter for a varying exposure duration either 3.4°of visual angle to the left or the right of the fixation cross (measured center-to-center). The location of the letter was chosen such that in both the cue and no cue conditions a letter was equally often presented at both locations. The letters were written in the font Arial (broad) with a letter point size of 68 corresponding to 2.0°Â 2.5°of visual angle and terminated by two pattern masks presented for 500 ms, one at each of the two locations. The pattern masks were made from black and dark grey letter fragments measuring 3.3°Â 3.3°of visual angle which completely covered the letters. Masks were presented at both locations to reduce automatic eye movements to the target location. Follow- ing the offset of the masks, participants reported the identity of the letter presented. Participants were instructed to make a nonspeeded report of the identity of the letter if they were ''fairly certain" of having seen it (i.e., to use all available information but refrain from pure guessing). If participants had no information on the identity of the letter, they conveyed this by starting the next trial without making a report. A 500 ms feedback display informed participants of whether their report was correct ('*') or not ('-'). Participants completed a total of 960 trials (i.e., 2 sessions of 480 trials) which were presented in blocks of 40 trials each. Participants were encouraged to take small breaks between blocks. See <ref type="figure" coords="4,32.71,182.99,20.42,7.53">Fig. 1</ref> for an outline of a trial in Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.">Modeling</head><p>For each condition (no cue, 85 dB cue), v and t 0 parameters were estimated separately for each subject by a maximumlikelihood estimation using the Nelder-Mead simplex optimization algorithm in Matlab (see <ref type="figure" coords="4,129.77,246.09,18.99,7.53">Fig. 2</ref>). Despite the instruction to refrain from pure guessing, subjects did occasionally guess on the identity of the presented letters. To improve the estimation of parameters, a high-threshold guessing model was introduced, which assumes that with a certain probability, p g , subjects guess randomly among the 20 letters if they fail to encode the presented letter into VSTM. That is, the probability of correctly reporting a single letter presented for an exposure duration of s is given by p &lt; 0.001, d z = 0.89, and a decrease in the perceptual threshold t 0 , t(27) = 3.52, p = 0.002, d z = 0.67, when a 85 dB cue is presented prior to the letter. No significant difference was found between conditions for the guessing parameter, p g;No cue = 0.67 and p g;85dB cue = 0.55, t(27) = 1.24, p = 0.23. For both conditions, the model explained on average 98% of the variance in the data.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,34.07,328.91,249.71,31.45">p ¼ 1 À e ÀvðsÀt 0 Þ þ e ÀvðsÀt 0 Þ p g 1 20 s &gt; t 0 p g 1 20 s 6 t 0 ( :<label>ð3Þ</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiment 2</head><p>In Experiment 1, we found a clear effect of phasic auditory alerting on visual perception: An alerting cue reduced the perceptual threshold and increased the processing speed of visual information compared with a condition in which no alerting cue was presented. To quantify these effects further, we ran a second experiment investigating the effect of the alerting intensity by including both trials with high (85 dB) and low (40 dB) intensity cues before letter presentation. Previous researchers have reported that an increase in the intensity of alerting auditory stimuli speeds up reaction times (e.g., , but the present study appears to be the first investigation of the effect of the intensity of alerting auditory stimuli on pure accuracy-based measures of visual perception.</p></div>

The three conditions were randomly intermixed in each testing block. Similar to Experiment 1, the cues were played equally often at either a high pitch of 900 Hz or at a low pitch of 500 Hz to avoid habituation to a specific auditory stimulus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Design</head><p>The design was identical to the design of Experiment 2, but in order to provide sufficient time for measuring pupil dilations, a retention interval was introduced after the offset of the mask display.

The duration of the retention interval was distributed geometrically using time-steps of 100 ms and a hazard rate of 2/5.

Pupil diameter was originally recorded in arbitrary pixels, but was converted into units of mm by scaling the original diameter according to the size of a 'model pupil' of known diameter measured under the same physical conditions used for testing the participants. Eye-blinks and other noise transients were removed offline using a custom linear interpolation algorithm (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="5,463.46,685.11,99.12,7.53;5,311.53,695.60,83.54,7.53" target="#b30">Murphy, Vandekerckhove, &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2014)</ref> replacing artifactual sections of data shorter than 1.5 s.

As in Experiment 2, paired t tests between the no cue and 40 dB cue conditions, t(24) = 5.47, p &lt; 0.001, d z = 1.09, and between the 40 dB cue and 85 dB cue conditions, t(24) = 2.23, p = 0.035, d z = 0.45, revealed an increase in processing speed, v, when a 40 dB cue was presented prior to the letter, and a further increase when a 85 dB cue was presented. Experiment 3 also replicated the previous finding of a decrease in perceptual threshold, t 0 , when a 40 dB cue, t(24) = 3.72, p = 0.001, d z = 0.75, or a 85 dB cue, t (24) = 2.61, p = 0.015, d z = 0.53, was presented prior to the letter display compared with trials in which no cue was presented. Also corresponding with the results obtained in Experiment 2, a paired t tests showed no difference in t 0 between the two cue conditions, t (24) = 2.01, p = 0.056. Further, no significant differences were found between conditions for the guessing parameter, p g;No cue = 0.33, p g;40dB cue = 0.27, and p g;85dB cue = 0.28, all ts 0.743, all ps ! 0.465. For all conditions, the model explained on average 99% of the variance in the data. 1 Technical problems prevented recording of pupil size in one of the 25 participants included in the behavioral analysis above. This resulted in a sample size of 24 (19 females, 5 males, mean age = 24.3 years) for the examination of the physiological effect of the alerting manipulation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig</head><p>To compare the pupil response between conditions, we identified the maximum peak for each subjects' mean pupil dilation relative to the baseline in an early (300-800 ms after cue onset) and late time window (800-2000 ms after cue onset) for each of the three conditions. Paired t tests comparing peak pupil dilation in the early time window showed a significant difference between the no cue condition (M = 0.056 mm, SD = 0.049) and 40 dB cue condition (M = 0.092 mm, SD = 0.056), t(23) = 8.34, p &lt; 0.001, d z = 1.70, and between the 40 dB cue condition and the 85 dB cue condition (M = 0.124 mm, SD = 0.52), t(23) = 5.43, p &lt; 0.001, 1 For Experiment 1, a likelihood ratio test showed that a 2 Â 3-parameter model (one set of v, t 0 , and p g parameters for each of the two experimental conditions) was a significantly better model compared with a 1 Â 3-parameter model (same set of v, t 0 , and p g parameters across conditions), v 2 (84) = 491.60, p &lt; 0.001. For Experiment 2, likelihood ratio tests showed that a 2 Â 3-parameter model (one set of parameters for the no cue condition; same set of parameters across the two cue conditions) was significantly better compared with a 1 Â 3-parameter model (same set of parameters across all conditions), v 2 (84) = 810.76, p &lt; 0.001. However, neither a 3 Â 3-parameter model (one set of parameters for each of the three experimental conditions) nor a 3 + 4-parameter model (one set of parameters for the no cue condition; separate v but same t 0 and p g parameters for the two cue conditions) were found to be significantly better compared with the 2x3-parameter model, v 2 (84) = 78.63, p = 0.645; v 2 (28) = 30.65, p = 0.333. For Experiment 3, likelihood ratio tests showed that the 2 Â 3parameter model should be preferred over the 1 Â 3-parameter model, v 2 (75) = 708.38, p &lt; 0.001. But neither the 3 Â 3-parameter model nor the 3 + 4-parameter model were found to be significantly better compared with the 2 Â 3-parameter model, v 2 (75) = 68.17, p = 0.699; v 2 (25) = 21.52, p = 0.663. d z = 1.11. Similarly, paired t tests comparing peak pupil dilation in the late time window showed a significant difference between the no cue condition (M = 0.107 mm, SD = 0.082) and 40 dB cue condition (M = 0.122 mm, SD = 0.084), t(23) = 3.67, p = 0.001, d z = 0.75, and between the 40 dB cue condition and the 85 dB cue condition (M = 0.187 mm, SD = 0.086), t(23) = 7.99, p &lt; 0.001, d z = 1.63. We further identified subjects' peak pupil dilation for each individual exposure duration in the late time window. Consistently for all three experimental conditions, we found that subjects' peak pupil dilation correlated positively with their processing speed estimate, v, for exposure durations of 30 ms (all rs &gt; 0.41, all ps &lt; 0.05, crosssubject correlations) and 40 ms (all rs &gt; 0.42, all ps &lt; 0.05), but not for higher or lower exposure durations (except for 20 ms in the 40 dB cue condition, r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.05). That is, we found a positive relationship between pupil dilation and processing speed but only when subjects were maximally challenged with exposure durations near threshold-level for which letter identification was difficult but not impossible (providing crucial information about the slope of the behavioral performance curve; see <ref type="figure" coords="7,224.11,549.11,18.94,7.53" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>In three experiments, we investigated the effect of phasic auditory alertness on early visual perception.

Presenting a visual alerting cue prior to a whole report display, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,239.75,674.68,53.81,7.53;7,42.52,685.11,24.96,7.53" target="#b28">Matthias et al. (2010)</ref> provided equivalent evidence that alerting increases processing speed, but they did not investigate effects on the perceptual threshold. Instead, they examined the effect of alerting on visual short-term memory (VSTM) capacity and on the spatial distribution of attentional resources, finding no modulation of VSTM capacity but a short-lived rightward shift of attentional resources following alerting. The effect of alerting on perceptual thresholds has, however, been addressed by <ref type="bibr" coords="7,441.69,360.83,72.86,7.53" target="#b23">Kusnir et al. (2011)</ref>, who asked subjects to detect and discriminate near-threshold visual stimuli preceded by a phasic alerting cue in 50% of trials. Equivalent to our findings, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,360.79,392.24,71.87,7.53" target="#b23">Kusnir et al. (2011)</ref> reported faster and more accurate responses to near-threshold stimuli in alerting trials, suggesting that the limit for conscious perception is affected by states of arousal. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,379.96,423.59,76.43,7.53" target="#b19">Jepma et al. (2009)</ref> investigated the effects of accessory stimuli on information processing by a diffusion model analysis. The accessory stimulus was a task-irrelevant sound presented very shortly before the visual stimulus to be identified; CTOA was 30 ms in one experiment and 100 ms in another one. According to the diffusion model analysis, the accessory stimulus speeded up the onset of the process of evidence accumulation (corresponding to a decrease in the t 0 parameter of TVA) but not the ensuing rate of evidence accumulation (corresponding to the v parameter of TVA). In our experiments, CTOA ranged between 200 ms and 470 ms with a mean of 244 ms. The contrast between our results and those of Jepma et al. may have resulted from participants using different strategies depending on the time available for processing the cue. In any case, the results of Experiment 1 are in line with previous research showing that phasic alerting influences early perception by both lowering the visual threshold and increasing the processing speed.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we investigated how alerting intensity influences visual perception and found that processing speed increased with the intensity of the alerting cue (higher processing speed in the 85 dB cue condition compared with the 40 dB cue condition), whereas the perceptual threshold was unaffected (equal thresholds in the 85 dB and 40 dB cue conditions). Thus, the results of Experiment 2 indicate a direct correspondence between levels of alertness and processing speed, whereas the perceptual threshold seems to be equally reduced regardless of the level of phasic alerting. It should be noted however that the differences between the cue conditions were of modest effect sizes (see also post hoc model comparisons; Footnote 1). <ref type="bibr" coords="7,323.21,726.95,102.78,7.53" target="#b5">Behar and Adams (1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords=""></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" coords="7,311.53,737.44,98.29,7.53" target="#b26">Loveless &amp; Sanford, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,412.61,737.44,87.04,7.53" target="#b50">Ulrich &amp; Mattes, 1996)</ref> have previously investigated how different levels of auditory alertness influence reaction times to visual stimuli and found that reaction times decreased with increasing intensities. Also, <ref type="bibr" coords="8,198.43,78.39,49.51,7.53" target="#b22">Keuss (1972)</ref> had subjects make a speeded response to an auditory stimulus preceded by an auditory alerting cue and found a decrease in reaction time with increasing cue intensities. Our results are consistent with these findings, but additionally show that intensity manipulation of alertness is directly linked to changes in early perceptual processes and not only motoric processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the relation between manipulation of alerting intensity and a pure accuracy-based measure of early visual perception, unconfounded by motor processes, has been investigated. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,44.39,182.99,85.25,7.53" target="#b9">Bundesen et al. (2015)</ref> have proposed a mathematical relationship between levels of alertness and visual processing speed by decomposing the visual bias, b i , associated with category i in the rate equation of TVA (see Eq. (1)), into a product of three terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="8,32.71,229.01,251.07,9.51">b i ¼ Ap i u i ;<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where A is the level of alertness, p i is the subjective prior probability of being presented with feature i, and u i is the subjective importance (utility) of identifying feature i. This multiplicative structure suggests that the visual processing speed increases monotonically with the level of alertness, A, which is in agreement with our behavioral data (see <ref type="figure" coords="8,88.78,297.96,18.67,7.53" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>).</p><p>Eq. (4) may also be understood in neural terms. According to the neural interpretation of TVA (NTVA) proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="8,225.02,318.88,58.74,7.53;8,32.71,329.31,22.99,7.53" target="#b8">Bundesen et al. (2005)</ref>, b i corresponds to the level of activation in the population of cortical cells that represents the categorization i (e.g., ''M" in case of letter recognition). If the level of alertness A is increased, b i is similarly upscaled, which results in faster processing of the visual categorization i. At the neural level, an increase in alertness should therefore be reflected in a directly proportional increase of activity in the cells that are specialized to represent the categorization.</p><p>Additional research will, however, be required to further validate the multiplicative structure of Eq. (4) by, for instance, setting up more complicated factorial designs, in which the level of alertness, A, is systematically varied in combination with manipulations of either the prior probability of being presented with a certain feature, p i , or the utility of identifying a certain feature, u i .</p><p>Changing the level of alertness, of course, also has more general effects in the brain. In Experiment 3, we replicated the results of Experiment 2 and also examined the general neurophysiological effects of phasic auditory alerting by measuring the pupil size of participants. Phasic pupillary responses have previously been linked to the intensity aspect of attention (alertness); larger pupillary responses indicating higher levels of attentional involvement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="8,52.16,549.11,60.15,7.53" target="#b21">Kahneman, 1973</ref>). Also at the neurophysiological level, a close relationship has been established between pupil size and the norepinephrine system (Aston-Jones &amp; Cohen, 2005) that is centrally involved in the brain's regulation of alertness <ref type="bibr" coords="8,209.25,580.52,74.57,7.53;8,32.71,591.00,21.81,7.53" target="#b40">(Posner &amp; Rothbart, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,57.54,591.00,65.35,7.53" target="#b49">Tona et al., 2016)</ref>. By manipulating alerting intensities, we found systematic relations between phasic pupillary responses and visual processing speed: At the general level, both pupillary responses and visual processing speed increased significantly when participants were phasically alerted. In addition, both measures increased further when the phasic alerting was intensified from 40 dB to 85 dB. At the individual level, participants with relatively high visual processing speed exhibited larger pupillary responses at exposure durations near threshold-level (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="8,32.71,685.11,92.53,7.53" target="#b15">Hakerem &amp; Sutton, 1966)</ref>, in all three conditions of the experiment, compared to participants with relatively low visual processing speed. Both the general and individual patterns of results provide support for a systematic relationship between visual processing speed and the level of alertness. A plausible interpretation of the general pattern of results is that auditory phasic alerting increases the brain's level of arousal, evident in larger pupillary responses, which also causes an increase in visual processing speed as described in Eq. (4). The individual pattern of results can similarly be accounted for by assuming that participants who are more strongly alerted by the auditory cue, as reflected in larger pupil responses, also tend to have higher visual processing speed than other participants (in accordance with Eq. (4)). The fact that participants with larger pupil responses tend to have higher visual processing speed even in the baseline condition (i.e., no cue condition) might be explained by the alerting effect of the letter stimuli: Participants must concentrate strongly in order to identify the brief letter stimuli, and the sudden onset of the stimulus display on the screen presumably has an alerting effect by itself. Participants who are more strongly alerted than others by the onset of the display, reflected in larger pupil responses, should also receive a larger boost in their visual processing speed (cf. Eq. (4)).</p><p>Our findings also have potential implications for studies of phasic alerting in patients with visual neglect after right hemisphere damage. It has been shown that the spatial imbalance in attentional weighting that is characteristic of neglect patients can be briefly normalized by phasic alerting <ref type="bibr" coords="8,455.30,266.71,93.47,7.53" target="#b42">(Robertson et al., 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,301.72,277.14,69.15,7.53" target="#b13">Finke et al. (2012)</ref> followed up on this finding to study the effects of phasic alerting on specific TVA parameters in patients with visual neglect. As well as normalizing the spatial distribution of attentional weights, Finke et al. found that phasic alerting increased the patients' visual processing speed. Given the findings of the present investigation, it would be interesting to study whether visual processing speed in neglect patients also increases monotonically with alerting intensity.</p><p>Together, the three experiments of the present study provide support for a close relationship between phasic alerting and specific aspects of visual perception: visual processing speed and the perception threshold. Whereas perceptual thresholds seem to be lowered regardless of the level of alerting, a positive relationship was found between the intensity of the alerting manipulation and the resulting level of visual processing speed. These findings are in accordance with a newly proposed extension of the mathematical TVA model, which incorporates alerting effects into this general model of visual attention.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,234.14,338.53,136.80,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Trial Model fitted to data from a single subject.
