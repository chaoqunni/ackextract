			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many businesses increasingly use strategic partnerships to manage corporate environmental agendas. However, how value is created in green partnerships remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, the authors examine the effects of announcements of green partnerships (marketing versus technology) on shareholder value. It is argued that in green partnerships firms leverage marketing and technology-related capabilities for value-enhancing purposes. The results show that announcements of green marketing partnerships have an immediate positive and significant effect on shareholder value, whereas announcements of green technology partnerships produce an immediate negative and significant effect. Nevertheless, green technology partnerships can accrue positive returns, but over a longer-term (1 year) period. In Bdirtier√Æ ndustries, it is more difficult to generate positive returns to green partnerships. Counterintuitively, though, in highpolluting industries, firms having a history of positive environmental performance experience lower financial gains from announcements of green partnerships than firms that were less environmentally responsible in the past.</p></div>

We address the following key research questions:</p><p>1. How do green strategic partnerships contribute to shareholder wealth? 2. What firm-and industry-related green factors drive the magnitude of the impact of green partnership announcements on shareholder wealth?</p><p>We adapt <ref type="bibr" coords="2,103.99,395.91,60.69,8.75" target="#b29">Gulati's (1998)</ref> definition of strategic partnerships and apply it to the green context. We define green strategic partnerships as voluntary arrangements between two or more organizations for the purpose of exchanging, sharing or co-developing environmentally friendly, or Bgreen^, products, technologies or services to pursue a set of strategic green goals or address critical business needs. Furthermore, in this paper, we distinguish between green marketing and green technology partnerships. A green marketing partnership is an agreement among organizations focusing on the green value chain activities, penetration of green markets, promotion of green product and services, and customer acquisition and retention <ref type="bibr" coords="2,51.03,545.35,65.90,8.75" target="#b73">(Park et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,119.07,545.35,132.96,8.75" target="#b94">Swaminathan and Moorman 2009)</ref>.

Building on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) and organizational capabilities literature, we propose that in green partnerships, firms combine organizational resources such as marketing and technology capabilities with firms' environmental expertise for value-creating purposes.</p><p>Based on an extensive archival search, we develop a unique dataset of 190 green strategic partnerships announced by 59 firms in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.87,84.60,19.00,8.75">[2005]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,355.87,84.60,4.75,8.75">[2006]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,360.62,84.60,19.00,8.75">[2007]</ref> and analyze it by event study and regression analyses. Specifically, we find that in the short term, stock markets react more favorably to the news about green marketing partnerships than to the news about green technology partnerships. The latter are still able to accrue positive financial returns but only over longer periods. When considering firm-and industry-related green factors, mixed patterns emerge. Investors become skeptical and discount stock market value of a firm if it has a history of poor environmental performance in the past or if it operates in the pollution-intensive industry. However, a firm's good green behavior in the past seems to have no direct effect on investors' valuation of green partnerships.</p><p>This study offers several contributions. First, we focus on the CSR practice, which is increasingly relevant for practitioners-green strategic partnerships-and quantify their impact on the stock market performance of a firm. Second, we identify the roles that marketing and technology capabilities play in green strategic partnerships and outline the pathways these capabilities can be leveraged for eco-based competitive advantage. We further explore the relative importance of marketing versus technology capabilities with respect to value creation potential in the context of green strategic partnerships. Finally, we incorporate other firm-and industry-related green factors that have not been previously considered, such as prior environmental performance of a firm and the industry's environmental profile (industry pollution levels). In this respect, we contribute to a long-standing debate about who is to benefit more from corporate environmentalism-those firms that only recently started to Bgreen^their businesses or the firms that have consistently been working on improving their environmental performance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,384.27,458.22,85.67,8.75" target="#b31">(Hart and Ahuja 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.07,458.22,68.04,8.75" target="#b97">Varadarajan 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we briefly review the literature on the impact of corporate CSR on firm financial performance. Then, we develop a set of hypotheses explaining how organizational capabilities affect the relationships between the announcements of green strategic partnerships and firms' stock market value. We then proceed with the methodology and results and conclude with implications for theory and practice and limitations of the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Firms' prior green performance and green strategic partnerships</head><p>Corporate environmental performance can be negative, reflecting an environmentally reactive position of a firm, or it can be positive, reflecting a firm's environmentally proactive stance. A reactive firm keeps environmental activities to a legal minimum for the mere purpose of reducing liabilities associated with non-compliance. An environmentally proactive firm goes beyond the legal minimums and voluntarily exceeds the environmental standards <ref type="bibr" coords="5,468.56,84.60,75.67,8.75;5,306.14,97.08,22.25,8.75" target="#b32">(Hart and Dowell 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,330.73,97.08,68.22,8.75" target="#b44">K√§rn√§ et al. 2003)</ref>. Importantly, firms may demonstrate positive, proactive environmental behavior in some of their business operations, while exhibiting negative, reactive environmental practices in other functional areas (Aragon-Correa and Rubio-Lopez 2007). Prior green performance is indicative of green competencies and expertise a firm has developed and affects investors' valuation of a firm's future cash flow. Prior negative green performance suggests that a firm previously followed a course of actions that was minimally acceptable and mandatory for everyone, for example, installed a minimal end-of-pipe pollution control equipment to ensure that emissions did not exceed a specific threshold. By following this path, a firm incurred costs associated with environmental policy compliance but did not acquire any green expertise because anyone can follow the same nominal strategy <ref type="bibr" coords="5,426.71,283.87,52.81,8.75" target="#b38">(Hunt 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,484.02,283.87,60.20,8.75;5,306.12,296.29,60.78,8.75" target="#b54">Leonidou and Leonidou 2011)</ref>. Although an announcement of a green partnership might signal that a firm intends to improve its environmental performance, because a firm has no unique environmental expertise to be leveraged with marketing and technology capabilities in a green partnership, such a firm is subject to higher liability risks and poor financial performance.</p><p>In contrast, prior positive green performance indicates that a firm has been consistently working on improving its environmental performance. A firm's proactive environmental position has already been ingrained in investors' minds and built into their expectations of a firm's future cash flow. Announcement of one more environmentally positive action is consistent with the status quo and will not change the stock market valuation of a firm. Thus, H3a: A firm's prior negative green performance will be negatively associated with a change in the stock market value of the firm in response to announcements of green strategic partnerships. H3b: A firm's prior positive green performance will not have an effect on the stock market value of the firm in response to announcements of green strategic partnerships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Industry pollution intensity and green strategic partnerships</head><p>Extant literature suggests that certain industry attributes can have a differential effect on the stock market valuation of strategic partnerships. Industries vary in terms of their pollution intensity-the average emission rates of various pollutants associated with industry activities. In industries that produce high pollution levels, so-called Bdirty^industries such as petroleum production or chemical industries, firms face higher liability risks and are subject to greater scrutiny and more stringent environmental regulations <ref type="bibr" coords="6,156.23,72.15,73.42,8.75" target="#b97">(Varadarajan 2015)</ref>. Research has shown that firms under unfavorable regulatory regimes assume higher costs of capital <ref type="bibr" coords="6,137.63,97.10,105.31,8.75" target="#b28">(Filbeck and Gorman 2004)</ref>. Moreover, in those Bstigmatized^industries, environmental costs comprise a sizable portion of firms' total operational costs. To improve environmental performance, firms undergo significant upgrades of operations far above and beyond pollution prevention measures that are small in scale and easy to implement <ref type="bibr" coords="6,95.69,171.82,124.07,8.75" target="#b20">(Diestre and Rajagopalan 2011)</ref>. Advanced technological modernizations for improving firms' environmental performance result in escalating costs and rapidly diminishing returns on investments (Aragon-Correa and Rubio-Lopez 2007; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,77.84,221.59,89.89,8.75" target="#b31">Hart and Ahuja 1996)</ref>. Hence, in dirtier industries, cost-related benefits of environmental improvements achieved in a green partnership will be lower than in less dirty economy sectors.</p><p>Furthermore, in dirtier industries, the potential of marketing capabilities to leverage a firm's green expertise for value creation purposes might be limited due to weaker stakeholder linking. According to a recent study <ref type="bibr" coords="6,191.96,308.78,93.06,8.75" target="#b2">(Barnett and King 2008)</ref>, people often hold persistent, unquestioned beliefs regarding the potential ecological threats posed by highly polluting industries and do not discriminate between the firms that act responsibly and improve their environmental performance and those that do not. As a result of the negative reputational commons associated with the industry as a whole, stakeholders push for more stringent control and liability measures for the total population of firms in the industry, rather than underachievers alone <ref type="bibr" coords="6,137.56,420.86,96.83,8.75" target="#b2">(Barnett and King 2008)</ref>. The finance literature also suggests the persistence of the negative Bhalo effect^when the wrongdoings of a few firms might have longterm negative financial consequences for the whole industry <ref type="bibr" coords="6,51.03,470.63,107.12,8.75" target="#b40">(Jarrell and Peltzman 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,160.79,470.63,52.09,8.75" target="#b66">Mitchell 1989</ref>). Thus, H4a: All other things being equal, industry pollution intensity is negatively related to the change in firm's stock market value in response to announcements of green strategic partnerships.</p><p>With respect to the past performance of firms operating in pollution-intensive industries, prior positive green performance suggests that a firm has already developed some environmental expertise. However, it also indicates that a firm has implemented at least some voluntary upgrades in excess of legal minimums. Given the disproportionally high negative environmental impact of those industries and the higherthan-average environmental compliance costs incurred by industry incumbents, further and more advanced environmental improvements would require substantial technological modernization of firm operations, which is highly risky and assumes escalating operational costs <ref type="bibr" coords="6,193.44,694.79,91.48,8.75" target="#b31">(Hart and Ahuja 1996)</ref>. As industry Bdirtiness^and the complexity of modernizations increase, the rising costs of upgrades would gradually offset the savings gained from the improvements implemented.</p><p>In contrast, prior negative green performance indicates that a firm did not invest in environmental upgrades and presumably faced higher ecological liability risks in the past. An announcement of a green partnership would signal a firm's intentions to improve its environmental performance. For Bhigh polluters^who just started implementing environmental upgrades, there are still sufficient opportunities for improvements via low-cost pollution-prevention measures, even in the context of dirtier industries (Aragon-Correa and Rubio-Lopez 2007). For those firms, improvements in environmental performance would lead to lower liabilities and better financial performance in the future. Therefore, H4b and (c): As the level of industry pollution intensity increases, a firm with more negative (positive) green performance in the past will experience higher (lower) returns to announcements of green strategic partnerships.</p><p>The theoretical model is summarized in <ref type="figure" coords="6,474.46,308.79,21.69,8.75">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>We define an event of interest as a public announcement of a strategic partnership between a publicly traded company and other organizations in the market, with the explicit environmental objectives stated in the announcement. To test the proposed research hypotheses, we collected a dataset of green partnerships announced by publicly traded US companies over the period of 2005-2007. First, we used the KLD Research and Analytics Database to obtain a list of firms for which an independent, third-party assessment of the environmental performance is available. For those firms, we searched the Corporate Register database, which provides access to CSR reports of the largest global corporations. We performed a content analysis of the reports to identify information related to green strategic partnerships. Next, we searched Lexis-Nexis, FACTIVA, newswire services and company websites to identify the dates of the first information releases. If there was ambiguity regarding the precise announcement date, we excluded that announcement from the dataset. We checked for contemporaneous financial (dividend announcements) and management (mergers and acquisitions, other partnerships, law suits, environmental awards, executive management changes, new product launches) announcements. If any such events had occurred in 3 days either side of the announcement day, we removed these announcements from the dataset. We also excluded minor, short-term events that were unlikely to impact the stock market valuation of a firm, e.g., a 1-day computer recycling event organized by a manufacturer in the distributor's location. The final dataset was composed of 54 observations for 2005, 64 observations for 2006 and 83 observations for 2007, 190 events in total.

The Bstrengths^refer to a firm's positive environmental actions (i.e., reliance on renewable energy, use of recycled materials, or commitment to voluntary environmental programs).

The prevailing view in the strategic management literature is that in high-tech industries, technology partnerships outperform marketing ones, and the opposite is true for the mature low-tech industries <ref type="bibr" coords="10,91.21,520.48,63.92,8.75" target="#b15">(Das et al. 1998)</ref>. Our dataset includes a good mix of high-and low-tech industries, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics <ref type="bibr" coords="10,113.96,545.42,57.33,8.75" target="#b33">(Heckler 2005)</ref>. The green marketing sample has a nearly equal split of 43 partnerships announced by firms in operating in low-tech industries and 40 partnerships announced by companies in high-tech economy sectors. The green technology sample comprises 62 partnerships announced by firms in low-tech industries and 45 partnerships announced by firms in high-tech industries. The mean difference tests conducted on the aggregate sample, as well as separately on the green marketing and green technology subsamples, show no statistically significant difference in mean abnormal returns for the low-tech versus high-tech industries for any of the event windows. From the short-term perspective, irrespective of the industry technological turbulence, announcements of green marketing partnerships consistently generate higher abnormal stock returns than announcements of green technology partnerships do.</p><p>Next, we estimated the long-term abnormal returns to announcements of green strategic partnerships using a longhorizon event study method that allows researchers to test for abnormal returns spread over long horizons, usually 1 to 5 years <ref type="bibr" coords="10,336.76,508.05,104.09,8.75" target="#b49">(Kothari and Warner 2006)</ref>. In line with the literature and following the recommendations presented in a recent review of methodological issues in long-horizon event studies by <ref type="bibr" coords="10,318.16,545.41,86.67,8.75" target="#b0">Ang and Zhang (2011)</ref>, we used two alternative estimation approaches, the buy-and-hold abnormal returns approach and the calendar-time portfolio returns with the Fama-French benchmark. Due to a relatively small sample size, a 1-year horizon was utilized <ref type="bibr" coords="10,387.59,595.18,109.90,8.75" target="#b48">(Kolari and Pynn√∂nen 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The buy-and-hold long-term abnormal returns (BHAR) approach is reflective of a strategy of investing into the stock that completed the event of interest and selling it at the end of the pre-determined holding period. We estimated the BHAR abnormal returns as compounded monthly returns over a 1-year period on a Fama-French benchmark. The calendar-time portfolio long-term abnormal return approach is based on estimating calendar-time portfolio returns for the firms completing the event of interest and calibrating whether those returns are abnormal in a multi-factor regression model over t-month post-event period. We utilized <ref type="bibr" coords="11,172.91,296.31,98.17,8.75" target="#b24">Fama and French (1993)</ref> factors in the multi-factor regression model. Both the BHAR approach and the calendar-time portfolio approach have their weaknesses and limitations. BHAR approach is known to produce inflated estimates due to compounding effects <ref type="bibr" coords="11,269.04,346.15,20.16,8.75;11,51.02,358.62,68.72,8.75" target="#b0">(Ang and Zhang 2011)</ref>, whereas the calendar-time portfolio approach is criticized for having very low power and being overly conservative <ref type="bibr" coords="11,112.99,383.51,104.50,8.75" target="#b49">(Kothari and Warner 2006)</ref>. To address these criticisms and ensure the robustness of the results, we used both approaches. <ref type="table" coords="11,62.37,420.87,29.99,8.75" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> shows the results of the analysis. The long-term abnormal returns following the news of green marketing partnerships were not significantly different from zero using either of the two estimation approaches. By contrast, the results for green technology partnerships show positive and statistically significant abnormal returns of approximately 6% of firm market value if estimated with the BHAR model and 4% if estimated using a more conservative calendar-time portfolio within 1 year after the announcement. Despite the initial negative reaction of investors, firms were still able to accrue positive financial returns following the green technology partnership announcements but over a longer period. Thus, based on the results of both short-term and long-term event studies, we found support for H1.</p><p>To test H3a,b and 4a,b,c, we ran cross-sectional analysis. The dataset is longitudinal in nature, wherein some firms announced once and others made multiple announcements over the observed period. In this case, a mixed linear model design was deemed appropriate because it allows researchers to account for unobserved heterogeneity and control for the correlated errors among observations nested within firms over time.</p><p>We specified a mixed model with random intercepts and random slopes reflective of the individual firm and time effects and a set of covariates. The dependent variable is firm abnormal returns on the announcement day t = 0. We used with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation procedure <ref type="bibr" coords="11,348.50,308.78,77.63,8.75" target="#b70">(M√ºller et al. 2013)</ref>. To examine goodness of fit and identify the best model, we tested the baseline Model 1 with control variables only vs. Model 2 with controls and main effects vs. full Model 3 with the controls, main effects and interaction terms. To compare the models, we used the traditional log-likelihood estimator and the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), which penalizes more complex models, leading to the optimal, most parsimonious one <ref type="bibr" coords="11,479.17,395.97,60.98,8.75" target="#b82">(Schwarz 1978)</ref>. The model specification that minimizes the log-likelihood and BIC estimators indicates the model that best fits the observed data. The results <ref type="table" coords="11,378.76,433.33,40.67,8.75" target="#tab_3">(Table W3</ref>, web appendix) indicate that Model 3, which includes the controls, main effects and interaction terms and decomposes the direct effects of the industry pollution intensity and a firm's past environmental performance, positive and negative, performs best, reporting the lowest log-likelihood and BIC estimators.</p><p>We report the results of the cross-sectional analysis in <ref type="table" coords="11,306.17,520.46,27.64,8.75" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>. The partnership type variable is a positive and significant determinant of AARs (p &lt; 0.01), which supports H2. Consistent with the results of the event study, in the short run, green marketing partnerships generated higher abnormal returns than green technology partnerships. Similarly, the firm past negative performance variable is negative and significant (p &lt; 0.05), supporting H3a. The impact of an announcement of a green partnership on a firm stock market value is lower if a firm had a history of poor environmental performance. As predicted, we did not observe a significant effect of firm's past positive performance on the stock market valuation of green partnerships. Thus, H3b is supported. The industry pollution intensity variable is a negative and significant determinant of AARs (p &lt; 0.05), confirming H4a. As industry pollution intensity increases, firms experience lower abnormal returns. Furthermore, we observed that the interaction term of the industry pollution intensity and firm's past positive green performance is negative and significant (p &lt; 0.05), confirming that the negative impact of the industry pollution intensity on AARs would be stronger for firms with a history of positive environmental performance. Thus, H4c is supported. Finally, the interaction term of the industry pollution intensity and firm's past negative green performance was not significant, although the direction was as predicted. H4b is not supported. In addition to the predicted effects, we also obtained insights into additional factors that affect the stock market valuation of green partnerships. The Firm Sales variable is negative and significant (p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that larger firms gain less from announcements of green partnerships. The partnership experience variable is positive and moderately significant (p &lt; 0.1), which is consistent with the established view in the strategy literature that firms with stronger partnership capabilities select most attractive partners and establish partnerships with higher value creation potential. Finally, the firm financial leverage variable is negative and significant (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that as firm debt increases, investors become more pessimistic about firm investments into environmental initiatives.</p><p>The model was also re-estimated for the event window (0; +1). Six out of seven parameters associated with the hypotheses remained stable in terms of direction and significance. The effect of industry pollution intensity became non-significant, but the sign was preserved as hypothesized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional robustness checks</head><p>To further increase confidence in the results, we performed various robustness checks. First, we re-estimated firms' abnormal returns with the alternative Fama-French-Carhart four-factor 1.80% -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</p><p>Abnormal returns, %  <ref type="bibr" coords="13,79.26,233.78,58.36,8.75" target="#b6">(Carhart 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,141.44,233.78,95.48,8.75" target="#b24">Fama and French 1993)</ref>. The results <ref type="table" coords="13,51.03,246.26,37.31,8.75" target="#tab_4">(Table W4</ref>, web appendix) were similar to those obtained with the market model, confirming that on the announcement day t = 0, in both partnership categories, stock markets report statistically significant abnormal returns to announcements of green partnerships. However, for the event window (0; +1), green technology partnerships report a non-significant non-parametric rank test, which suggests that the results might be driven by influential outliers. This finding confirms that AARs observed on the day of an announcement t = 0 are the most appropriate for cross-sectional analysis. Second, we re-estimated a crosssectional model with regression with robust standard errors and clustered events, an alternative estimation approach used when data are heteroscedastic and intra-group correlations are suspected. The results of the regression with robust standard errors and clustered events <ref type="table" coords="13,153.80,420.58,37.17,8.75" target="#tab_5">(Table W5</ref>, web appendix) replicate those reported in <ref type="table" coords="13,115.70,433.00,26.51,8.75" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>. Finally, we re-estimated the expanded version of a cross-sectional model with the mixed model design by including additional firm and industry controls, namely firm market share, industry growth, and industry competitive intensity variables. All the hypothesized relationships remained stable in terms of their sign and significance. None of the additional controls was significant, and the model fit did not improve significantly. For reasons of parsimony, we retained a shorter version of the cross-sectional model and reported the results as our main findings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and implications for theory and practice</head><p>We designed this study to explore the impact of green strategic partnerships on firm financial performance. Overall, our findings have implications for theories of CSR, organizational capabilities, and marketing-finance interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore an increasingly relevant type of corporate environmental practice-green strategic partnerships, and their contribution to the stock market performance of a firm and the boundary conditions under which the economic gains are maximized. Our findings demonstrate that stock markets are selective in reacting to announcements of green partnerships, and some of those initiatives can, in fact, destroy shareholder value. In the short term, green marketing partnerships systematically outperform green technology partnerships, which offers a contrasting view to previous research. Historically, variations in the valuation of different types of inter-firm collaborations have been explained by industry dynamism (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" coords="13,343.61,508.06,63.01,8.75" target="#b73">Park et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,408.86,508.06,64.20,8.75" target="#b89">Song et al. 2005)</ref>. According to the traditional point of view, in high-tech industries, technology partnerships would be more greatly rewarded by stock markets than marketing partnerships because the former spur organizational innovation, which is a better source of competitive advantage under the conditions of volatile and rapidly changing high-tech industries. In contrast, our research demonstrates that irrespective of industry dynamism, green marketing partnerships can be superior and generate greater returns than green technology partnerships do. This finding contributes to the emerging stream of marketing literature advocating for the relative advantage of marketing over technology resources and elevates marketing's position in the hierarchy of organizational functions <ref type="bibr" coords="13,428.99,669.91,115.35,8.75;13,306.15,682.38,22.25,8.75" target="#b52">(Krasnikov and Jayachandran 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,330.98,682.38,91.69,8.75" target="#b65">Mishra and Modi 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we add to the body of literature on the role and contributions of organizational capabilities to firm performance.  An emerging stream of research has begun to examine the interplay of organizational capabilities with firm CSR and explore their joint value creation potential <ref type="bibr" coords="14,179.10,470.70,110.01,8.75" target="#b57">(Luo and Bhattacharya 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,51.03,483.12,89.37,8.75" target="#b65">Mishra and Modi 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,142.59,483.12,100.32,8.75" target="#b84">Servaes and Tamayo 2013)</ref>. We extend this line of research by explicitly outlining the pathways through which firm marketing and technology capabilities can be combined with environmental expertise to gain eco-based competitive advantage in the context of strategic partnerships. We also quantify the effect of green marketing versus green technology inter-firm strategies on shareholder wealth. Third, we contribute to advancing research on the marketingfinance interface. Many studies examining the association between firm CSR and shareholder value focus on the short-term implications and analyze the immediate stock market reaction to firm CSR news. This study takes a step further and analyzes both the short-term and long-term consequences of green CSR, revealing an interesting reverse trend. Initially, green technology partnerships negatively affect firm value but later experience upward stock market price's adjustments. This trend suggests that financial markets are unable to immediately recognize the economic value of green technologies and incorporate it into the stock market price with a drift. Over time, as uncertainty associated with green innovation projects diminishes, investors revise and update their expectations regarding future cash flow, which results in positive abnormal returns <ref type="bibr" coords="14,462.58,470.70,74.17,8.75" target="#b90">(Sorescu et al. 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="14,540.51,468.42,3.74,5.83">1</ref> Moreover, a legacy of prior environmental performance can drive investor sentiment towards green partnerships. In contrast to the argument in the extant literature that CSR may protect firms in times of crisis and offset negative consequences <ref type="bibr" coords="14,341.97,532.95,114.35,8.75" target="#b81">(Schnietz and Epstein 2005)</ref>, we show that stock markets are, in general, insensitive to information about prior positive environmental behavior and do not amend for that. As levels of pollution intensity in industry increase, firms might even be penalized for being environmentally responsible. Investors also become skeptical if a green partnership is announced by a firm with a history of poor green performance, which reinforces the idea of general investor conservatism regarding green partnerships.</p><p>The reason for stock market conservatism can be a lack of experience in CSR and green partnerships in particular.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for managers</head><p>We offer valuable insights for managerial practice as well. First, our results reliably suggest that green partnerships can be instrumental in carrying out firms' environmental strategies and generate economic gains. At the same time, managers must be aware that not all of those initiatives generate immediate positive returns. Based on the sample of firms studied, announcements of green marketing partnerships, on average, led to a $126.99 million increase in firm market value on the day of an announcement. By contrast, a firm's market value decreased, on average, by $102.41 million on the day when a green technology partnership was announced. Nevertheless, 1 year after an announcement of a green technology partnership, the firms concerned reported an average increase of $1638.52 million in stock market value. Managers interested in greening firm operations can choose alternative pathways to allocate firm resources to green marketing or green technology domains, based on their short-term and long-term goals. Firms should also pay attention to their environmental reputation. The results highlight the fact that Bdoing bad^hurts more than Bdoing good^helps. It is in the interest of firm shareholders that managers implement positive green strategies across all business domains and avoid negative green approaches altogether. At the same time, managers should be cognizant of the potential risks associated with green activism in pollution-intensive industries and that stock markets might not recognize those initiatives as investments with positive future cash flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and suggestions for further research</head><p>This study is not without limitations, which suggest avenues for future research. First, one of the major challenges of this study is related to the high heterogeneity of the sample due to the scarcity of green partnership data within any particular industry. Unobserved industry attributes may have affected the examined relationships. Over time, as the amount of data on green partnerships increases, future studies could explore whether the observed effects hold in more homogenous settings and whether other Bhidden^relationships surface. Second, due to limitations associated with secondary data, this study focuses on US companies. It is possible that in other countries, stock markets exhibit different patterns of reacting to green partnership news. Future research could consider including data from, for example, European countries, where sustainability issues are of high importance. Third, in contrast to this study, which focuses on large, established firms, future research could explore how small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) use green partnerships. SMEs comprise a majority of businesses worldwide, often lack necessary resources and might be more interested in pursuing green partnerships for efficiency reasons. Finally, the dataset in this study was dominated by partnerships with two partners only, as opposed to multi-partner collaborations. Recent research suggests that a dyadic versus multiple-partner structure might drive investor valuation of strategic collaborations <ref type="bibr" coords="15,445.93,184.21,66.64,8.75" target="#b26">(Fang et al. 2016)</ref>. Future studies could investigate whether green partnerships with multiple partners, vertical and horizontal, make any difference to changes in stock returns.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="8,317.45,420.85,215.38,8.75;8,317.45,433.33,215.38,8.75;8,317.45,445.80,215.51,8.75;8,317.45,458.21,215.44,8.75;8,317.45,470.69,194.06,8.75"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Decision to form a green partnership=f(Firm Age, Firm Market Capitalization; Firm Financial Leverage; Firm Sales; Market Share; Partnership Experience; Industry Competitive Intensity; Industry Growth; Environmentally Sensitive Industries; Industry Effects; Time Effects).</figDesc></figure>
